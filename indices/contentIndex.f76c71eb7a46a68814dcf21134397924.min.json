[[Sources/Demand Curve/Leveraging Your Market and Customer Research]]\n5. [[Sources/Demand Curve/How to Apply Customer Research to Marketing and Product]]\n\n##### Cheat Sheet\n###### Step 1: Collect customer and market data\nTo find out what jobs customers are hiring your product for, use a combination of research methods:\n1.  Interview users to get deeper insights.\n2.  Use surveys to tap into larger audiences.\n3.  Do field research to observe real-life behavior.\n4.  Analyze your current customer data for trends.\n5.  Study your competitors‚Äô products, customers, and reviews.¬†\nThe most important questions your research should answer:\n-   What is the problem people are hiring your product for?\n-   How do people decide to solve their problem?\n-   What criteria do people use to judge different products?\n###### Step 2: Leverage your research\nThree ways to leverage your research findings:\n-   Create customer personas to help visualize your audience as individuals. ¬†\n-   Use a¬†customer/market profile¬†to summarize your research in one place.\n-   Map out the customer journey to identify user pain points and behaviors throughout different stages of the buying process.\n###### Step 3: Improve your marketing and product\nApply your research to your marketing and product using the psych framework.\n-   Run through each stage of your customer journey map to find negative psych elements that discourage people from moving on.\n-   Mark where these negative elements happen in the journey.\n-   Then optimize your marketing and product to reduce them.\nNot all psych elements are within your control, but using this framework helps to identify those that are.\n#### 2. **Competitor Research**\n##### Modules\n1.

[[Sources/Demand Curve/How to Identify the Right Competitors to Study]]\n4. [[Sources/Demand Curve/How to Actually Do Competitor Research]]\n##### Cheat Sheet\n###### Step 1: Identify competitors to study\n-   Ask leads and customers what other companies/products they‚Äôve considered.\n-   Look through Crunchbase, Product Hunt, and G2.\n-   Break down your users‚Äô workflow to see what products match each task‚Äôs needs.\n-   See what companies rank highly in Google for your target keywords.\n###### Step 2: Grade competitors\nJudge which competitors are worth researching based on their quality, rigor, and relevance. Here‚Äôs how to judge them.\n- **Quality:**¬†High quality companies generally:\n\t1.  Generate lots of revenue (or have raised a lot of money).\n\t2.  Have teams that have evolved beyond their founders.\n\t3.  Have a consistent history of growth.\n- **Rigor:**¬†Filter out competitors that do not meet at least two of these criteria.¬†\n\t1.  Publicly share their growth experimentation efforts.\n\t2.  Hire dedicated growth marketers and data scientists.\n\t3.  Use experimentation software (find this out using BuiltWith).\n- **Relevance:**¬†The best competitors to study, in order of relevance to your company:\n\t1.  Direct competitors (same problem, customer, and solution)\n\t2.  Indirect competitors with a different solution (same problem and customer)\n\t3.  Indirect competitors with a different problem (same solution and customer)\n\t4.  Indirect competitors with a different customer (same problem and solution)\n###### Step 3: Collect growth insights\nResearch competitors‚Äô landing pages, ad channels, and content marketing for growth insights.\n- **Landing pages**\n\t-   Study your competitors‚Äô sites for their brand messaging and to see if any A/B tests are being run.\n- **Ad channels**\n\t-   Use Ahrefs to find out their paid search keywords and ad landing pages.\n\t-   Use BuzzSumo to see which pages have the most social engagement.\n\t-   Look at competitors‚Äô Facebook and Instagram ads using Facebook Ads Library.\n\t-   View their ads on LinkedIn.\n- **Content marketing**\n\t-   Use Ahrefs to find out their organic keywords and the pages with the most backlinks.\n\t-   Look up competitors in Google Trends to gauge their brand awareness.\n\t-   Look through your competitors‚Äô active social media channels and see how often users post authentic comments.\n#### 3. **Value Props \u0026 Messaging**\n- [[Sources/Demand Curve/Introduction to Value Props]]\n#### 4. **Branding**\n1.

They will be used to signify misinformation-fuelled diet culture and its victims: people who will resort to desparate measures just to get their desired bodies.\n\nOne inspiration behind this *novum* is my mother, who happens to be one of these people. Being overweight is one of her greatest insecurities. Rather than committing to sustainable healthy habits, what she'd often do instead is buy all the popular diet powders, teas, pills, etc. She'd even offer these to me as well, knowing that I also want to lose weight. Whenever I'd question her on the effectiveness of these products, she'd never be able to defend them properly (she'd always gain the weight she initially lost from trying them); however, even after being reminded of their unreliability, she'd still continue buying them. Thus, I can't help but recognize this kind of cognitive dissonance whenever I see a popular diet supplement.\n\nAnother inspiration is the dangerous tapeworm diet. I find it disturbing how people ‚Äî particularly women ‚Äî have been purposefully infecting themselves for years (even since the [Victorian era](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/the-horrifying-legacy-of-the-victorian-tapeworm-diet)) despite all the unpleasant side effects. Aside from tapeworms, I am also considering the giardia parasite as the signifier. Here is an interesting excerpt from Schrage's [\"High-Tech Tapeworms Could Be the Diet Fad of the Next Century\"](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1991-09-19-fi-3549-story.html): \n\n\u003eActually, it turns out that tapeworms are probably the wrong parasite for weight management. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of mythology surrounding tapeworms,‚Äù says Dickson Despommier, a Columbia University professor of public health and microbiology. ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt really induce weight loss; they don‚Äôt eat enough to compete with our digestive systems for food.‚Äù\n\u003e\n\u003eHowever, Despommier points to¬†_giardia lamblia_¬†as a parasite with potential. A protozoa (basically, a flagellate with an attitude) that‚Äôs responsible for creating particularly nasty cases of diarrhea, giardia does have one fascinating property: It generates a chemical that prevents the human digestive system from absorbing animal fat.\n\u003e\n\u003eThe trick, says Despommier, would be to figure out giardia‚Äôs active ingredient and synthesize it. ‚ÄúThat would be outstanding,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIf you could find out from giardia what its molecular secret was to prevent the absorption of animal fat . . . it‚Äôs a straightforward logical extension for the biology of this organism.‚Äù\n\u003e\n\u003eTheoretically, you could create ‚Äúanti-fat‚Äù pills from this agent or even cultivate specially bred bowel colonies of giardia that block the fat without generating the runs. It‚Äôs not clear if pharmaceutical companies have begun to explore this parasite‚Äôs potential--but there‚Äôs no question that such research would be both technically feasible and possibly enormously profitable.\n\nConsuming parasites already makes weight loss terrifying and bizarre, but it's still too close to reality (unfortunately). Genetically engineering parasites to become symbionts would bring weight loss pills into the realm of the unreal. However, I worry that removing all the negative side-effects of infections would diminish the *novum*'s signified. To tackle this, I'm considering making zombification the pills' main consequence (similar to [Mira Grant's *Parasitology* series](https://www.goodreads.com/series/99015-parasitology)). Perhaps taking these pills would turn wannabe dieters into perpertual salespeople; their living days would be fully consumed by trying to market these pills to others (Yes, I'm cracking down on MLMs. Looking at you, USANA!).\n\nFor the form of this project, I want to make a website for promoting the fictional weight loss pills. This would feature the benefits of these pills, results from clinical trials, and success stories shared by customers. These main parts (along with other sections like FAQ and Disclaimer) will be used to showcase the *novum*.  I am still debating whether I want to make this website look professional, or as scammy as possible (through dark marketing tactics).\n\n##### Mail-to-order Partners\nMy project will focus on artificially made mail-to-order brides/husbands. Human reproductive cloning and genetic engineering are used as signifiers to stand for the commodification of life and love, along with the unequal power dynamic behind many transnational relationships.\n\nThe main inspiration behind this *novum* is [Yvette Tan's \"Seek Ye Whore\"](https://web.archive.org/web/20220811151400/https://yvettetan.com/2019/02/11/seek-ye-whore/), which features siquijorbrides.com: a fictional website for inhuman mail-to-order brides. The protagonist, a middle-aged American male, orders one to use as a servant and blow-up doll, and ends up getting more than what he wished for. While reading this story, I was reminded of how acquiring this kind of relationship is so easy nowadays; technology (the Internet) mediates it, media (*90 Day Fiance*) promotes it, and culture (colonial mentality) sustains it. Aside from this, I also find inspiration in  AI humans like [Star Labs' NEONs](https://neonlife.ai/) and [Replika's companions](https://replika.com/). I'm intrigued by technologies behind these creations and people are reacting to them. A notable example: Replika's recent shutting down of its erotic roleplay functionality left much of its community devastated, to the point that [many of its members were sharing suicide prevention resources](https://knowyourmeme.com/news/replika-ai-shuts-down-erotic-role-play-community-shares-suicide-prevention-resources). Putting these two inspirations together, I can't help but think about how  dehumanization seems utterly inescapable in a capitalist system; even non-human species like monsters and robots don't seem to have a chance. What better way of reflecting this truth than the production of humans for the sake of \"marriage\"?\n\nThus, this project will be centered on a biotech company making and selling such humans, aiming to provide everyone in the world (who can afford it) the perfect match. However, since perfection is contextually dependent, the company will be providing a variety of humans to choose from. The only characteristic shared by all the models would be their physically optimal condition (i.e. youthful and healthy, high libido). A particular question I'd like to explore (inspired by Ted Chiang's \"The Lifecycle of Software Objects\") is the personality expression of an artificially made human: if a person purchases their dream partner, would this partner come with a personality or not? While I think the buyer would be able to dictate certain inclinations (e.g. less aggressive, more social), I believe that the partner's personality would develop further when they're already in contact with the buyer.  \n\nFor the form of this project, I will make a website for  selling these mail-to-order partners. The design of this will be based off existing dating websites, where potential partners can be filtered by physical characteristics (e.g. age, ethnicity, height and weight, hair and eye color, body type, etc.). If a user doesn't find anything they like from the ready-made selection, they can choose to order their own. The made-to-order page will allow a user to choose the physical characteristics they'd want for their partner. The website will also contain pages (such as \"Learn More\" and \"FAQ\") that dive deep into the production process of these partners. I'm planning to use AI-generated art for the visuals of these partners in order to make them look both perfect and uncanny.\n\n##### Influencer Hivemind\nMy project will focus on a human hivemind consisting of content creators that uses eusociality, nanotechnology, and the group mind as signifiers to signify the exploitative nature of the social media industry ‚Äî for both influencers and their audiences.\n\nFor the form of this project, I will write an expos√© that also serves as an interactive article (similar to [the Guidon's interactives](https://interactive.theguidon.com/)).  \n\n#### Version 2\n##### Outline\n- Novum summary\n- Inspirations\n\t- Tapeworm diet\n\t- The Autopsy?\n\t- \"The Only Neat Thing to Do\"\n- Biological component\n\t- Tapeworm that goes in both brain and mind?\n\t- comes in pill or drink format?\n\t- Progression?\n\t\t- Infection\n\t\t- Migration\n\t\t\t- to intestines, then to brain\n\t\t- Attachment\n\t\t\t- frontal lobe? prefontal cortex?\n\t\t- Control\n\t\t\t- when they become a salesperson\n\t\t\t- a behavior that is advantageous to the parasite, helping it spread more (through sales)\n\t\t\t\t- \"Such amazing parasites do all of this by high-jacking, co-opting, and manipulating their hosts' nerve impulses and¬†**neurotransmitters**, which are the hormones produced by our nervous system that regulate our behaviors.

They will be used to signify misinformation-fuelled diet culture and its victims: people who will resort to desparate measures just to get their desired bodies.\n\n**On the Novum**\nIn a world saturated with diet products, Shapeshifters Co.'s Trim Tonic‚Ñ¢  weight-loss shake is the latest gamechanger, reknown for its unprecedented efficiency and effectiveness. Instead of following a routine for 7 or 30 days...all you have to do is drink this once, and let it do its magic! Over the span of a month, your metabolism will drastically increase in speed, making burning fat as easy as pie. This change comes with no harmful side-effects (unlike most laxatives), and it will remain long-term for sure. Forget about exercise programs and meal plans; all you need is one drink to change your life. It costs just $200 ‚Äî a bargain price for a worthy investment.\n\nMarketing voice aside, the secret ingredient behind this powerful shake is its special tapeworms. Each ready-made shake comes with its own eggs. Once these are consumed, they go to the consumer's intestines; here, they hatch and develop in adults over the course of 3 weeks (a sped-up growth rate thanks to genetic engineering). They then attach themselves to the intenstinal walls  in order to start absorbing nutrients from food digestion. This is when the consumer will start experiencing rapid weight loss. \n\nBesides the intestines, the tapeworms are also designed to migrate and attach themselves to the brain. These would then influence the consumer to become an avid network marketer for the company: buying, promoting, and selling the shakes so that more people would try them out. The company, Shapeshifters Co., altered the tapeworms this way in order to use them as a growth strategy; why spend millions on influencer marketing when you can make your customers do it for free? All the aforementioned behaviors are also advantageous for the tapeworms (in a reproductive perspective), so they encourage these by hijacking the brain's reward system (a.k.a. the mesocorticolimbic circuit). Pleasure is experienced everytime a sale is made, and motivation is high for relevant activities like finding leads. \n\nHowever, this modified system can also turn on the consumer; if they aren't succeeding with sales for a certain period of time, they can experience withdrawal-like symptoms such as irritability, depression, and anxiety. These effects on mental health are further exacerbated by the consumer's infected intestines, given that [the gut and the brain are intimately connected](https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/the-gut-brain-connection). When it comes to real-life multi-level marketing, [many people trapped in the system feel addicted to it](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiMLM/comments/8kg5gj/mlm_and_addiction/); thus, I thought it would brain-hijacking parasites would be a good signifier for this.\n\nDespite their secret, Shapeshifters Co. is able to make these shakes without problems. The Food and Drug administration (FDA) [does not have the authority to approve dietary supplements (for their safety and effectiveness, and/or for their labelling) before they are marketed](https://www.fda.gov/food/information-consumers-using-dietary-supplements/questions-and-answers-dietary-supplements). It is the company that is responsible for ensuring that their supplements meet safety standards. However, the FDA still plays a role in regulating these supplements (e.g. inspecting manafacturing facilities, reviewing product labels, monitoring adverse reports). To ensure secrecy, Shapeshifters Co. utilizes genetic engineering techniques to make the tapeworms difficult to detect using traditional testing methods. Aside from this, the product's label hides this from the ingredient list (which is already difficult to read). Misleading health claims and testimonials are also used to make the product look legitimate (thanks ChatGPT for the suggestions).\n\n- Possible names:\n\t- Trim Tonic\n\t- Lean \u0026 Mean\n\n\n**On the Form**\nThis project will consist of two components: a website that promotes the fictional weight loss shakes, and an article that aims to expose the shakes' secrets.\n\nThe website will feature the benefits of these shakes, results from clinical trials, and success stories shared by customers. These main parts (along with other sections like FAQ and Disclaimer) will be used to showcase the¬†_novum_. Along with the website, I will be designing the label of the product, along with possible advertisements. For this, I think I will be taking inspiration from  the designs of \"gym bro\" supplements, \"natural\" detox products, and vintage tapeworm diet advertisements.\n\nThe article will serve to show the progressive stages of the parasite. It will be a post published on a fake r/conspiracytheories; I'll recreate a single page of the subreddit through design and code. This post will include a link to the Shapeshifters website, connecting both of this project's components as one interactive experience. The story will start with background context on the product's popularity, showing screenshots of Instagram posts and Tiktok videos from fictional influencers. Then, this will segue to the writer's mother, who tried out the shake for herself. The author then witnesses her mother become a whole new person. At first, she experiences rapid weight loss and is raving all about it. However, she also starts having an obsessive personality; all she cares about now is sharing the shakes everywhere. Concerned, she acquires a shake from her mother just to investigate it herself, being a medical school student. She is then shocked to find tapeworm eggs inside (To be honest, tapeworm eggs look a lot like rice grains...and rice shakes exist so...). Aware that her mother wouldn't believe her (she wasn't open to criticism at all), the author resorts to desparate measures by sneaking antiparasitic medication in her mother's food. While this sends the mother to the bathrooom (and keeps her stuck there), her mind is still on hyper-salesperson mode. Lost, the author asks the subreddit for help, unsure of what to do next. I'd imagine the comments are filled with people confirming the effects of the shakes, along with those theorizing what they do.\n\n## Final Project\n### To-do\n- [x] Youtube clone\n- [ ] Product website\n\n### Notes\n- Product Details:\n\t- Title: \n\t\t- Trimaenia?

You could explore the ethical, social, and environmental implications of such a world, as well as the potential conflicts and challenges that might arise from it. For example, you could ask questions like:\n\t- How would people‚Äôs identities and relationships change if they could alter their appearance, abilities, or personality traits?\n\t- What would be the benefits and risks of creating new species or hybrids of existing ones?\n\t-   How would the natural ecosystems and biodiversity be affected by the introduction of GMOs?\n\t-   What would be the legal and political issues involved in regulating GMOs and protecting human rights?\n\t-   How would different cultures and religions react to GMOs and their creators?\n\t-   What would be the role of science and technology in this society?\n- There are different factors that could influence the popularity of GMOs in the future, such as:\n\t- The¬†**demand**¬†for food: As the world population grows and urbanizes, the demand for food will increase, especially for animal products and processed foods.¬†[GMOs could help meet this demand by increasing crop yields, enhancing nutritional quality, and reducing food waste](https://www.statista.com/topics/2062/genetically-modified-crops/)[1](https://www.statista.com/topics/2062/genetically-modified-crops/)[2](https://www.fda.gov/food/agricultural-biotechnology/how-gmo-crops-impact-our-world)\n\t- The¬†**environmental**¬†challenges: Climate change, water scarcity, soil degradation, and biodiversity loss are some of the environmental challenges that threaten food security and sustainability.¬†[GMOs could help address these challenges by improving crop resilience to stress, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and conserving natural resources](https://www.statista.com/topics/2062/genetically-modified-crops/)[1](https://www.statista.com/topics/2062/genetically-modified-crops/)[2](https://www.fda.gov/food/agricultural-biotechnology/how-gmo-crops-impact-our-world)[3](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/the-future-of-eating-gm-crops.html)\n\t- The¬†**innovation**¬†in biotechnology: Advances in biotechnology could enable the development of new and improved GMOs that offer more benefits and fewer risks.¬†[For example, gene editing techniques such as CRISPR-Cas9 could allow more precise and targeted modifications of crops, animals, and microorganisms](https://www.statista.com/topics/2062/genetically-modified-crops/)[1](https://www.statista.com/topics/2062/genetically-modified-crops/)[2](https://www.fda.gov/food/agricultural-biotechnology/how-gmo-crops-impact-our-world)\n\t- The¬†**regulation**¬†of GMOs: The regulation of GMOs varies widely across countries and regions, depending on their policies, laws, and public opinions.

I was a little surprised when they proposed the concept of the illustrations: cockroaches! But once they told me their rationale, it made so much sense.

Despite its necessity, the nature of space exploration renders this scouting mission lifelong, isolating, and possibly deadly. Thus, most of the people who enlist are criminals sentenced with life imprisonment/death row, along with desparate people who want to pay off massive debts for their families. \n\t- Accouting for space's extremely harsh conditions (e.g. radiation, negative temperatures), humans  experiment with integrating cockroach DNA into these scouts' bodies. These turn them  into human-cockroach hybrids.  ==Talk more about in-game traits they gained==\n\t- ^ They were acclaimed as heroes....\n\t- This initial batch of scouts gave rise to the Blattodeans, who now  proliferate the galaxy centuries later. In the societies they inhabit, they typically act as scavengers and salvagers. Considered an \"untouchable\" race, they are looked down upon by other species. \n\t- Together, Blattodeans make up tight-knit communities. Large families (including grandparents, aunts/uncles, and cousins) are packed together in single households. They also don't have their own leaders, since everyone sees each other as equals; whenever a decision needs to be made (e.g. choosing where to forage or make nests), it is done collectively. Being social is essential to their survival; Blattodeans who grow up alone end up physically and emotionally stunted.\n- Biological Processes:\n\t- The main differentiator between male and female Blattodeans are their wings. The males' wings span their full body length, while the females' wings are only half this size; thus, only the former is able to fly. This dictates their typical functions. Males take on jobs that require a lot of mobility (e.g. scouting for food), leaving females with the jobs that don't require as much movement (e.g. caretaking). This is also reflected in their mating process; males are the ones who actively search for partners, while females just have to choose.\n\t- Mate with sugar\n- Biology and Society: \n\t- When the first batch of Blattodeans were sent out into space, they were provided   specially-made Space Suits that would allow them to survive in unterraformed planets. First, these regulate body temperatures so that they can bear extreme heat or cold. Second, these provide limited supplies of oxygen and water. Finally, they come with dual sensory communication systems; audio technology enables them to relay sounds, while olfactory technology enables them to transmit pheromones. These systems allowed them to commmunicate not only with each other, but also an external mission control team. \n\t- What also differentiates these Space Suits from normal ones is that they're ultra-light; they were sculpted for Blattodean morphology so that they wouldn't hinder mobility. \n\t- However, one lesser known feature of these suits is that they came with a remote-control mechanism. This ensured that the Blattodeans would not step out of line. Whenever a scout was misbehaving, control of their suit was taken from them. \n\t\t- Inspired by cockroach backpacks\n\t- Significant progress over time (i.e. extensive evolution of the Blattodeans; increasing number of terraformed planets) has diminished the need for these Space Suits. Most Blattodeans would not be able to experience wearing one due to a lack of necessity and/or capability to travel outside of their home planet.\n\t- Now, the primary value these Suits would offer would be as historical artifacts -- concrete reminders of the early days of space exploration.\n- Ecology and Worldbuilding:\n\t- Blattodeans do not have a home planet, being scattered all over the galaxy. They prefer planets with tropical climates (either wet or monsoon) due to their biology. One reason is that they can only go one week without water, which requires them to live in humid or high-moisture environments. Another reason is that they are cold-blooded, which bar them from thriving in extremely hot or cold temperatures.\n\t- They are most likely to be found in settlements like cities, towns, and villages ‚Äî anywhere trash is produced.  Some Blattodean populations can also be seen in the wild, living in forests and caves.\n\t- They have flexible diets, which adapt to their environments.

It is ==tasty, cheap==, and everybody loves the taste, even if it is ==unhealthy==. This concept of fast food has spread to schools throughout the country. Dr. P Mark Taylor and Darris J. Brock discuss this theory in their book Fast Food Education. They define education as ‚Äúwhat is left over when you forget everything that your teacher made you memorize when you were in school.‚Äù (41) This book discusses the flaws in today‚Äôs education system and how it can be altered to benefit more students. I agree with this book‚Äôs beliefs on education and the authors present the information with an interesting and gripping metaphor. \n\u003e \n\u003e The authors believe that ==education is poorly scaled.== Students are put into grades based on age and not on readiness to proceed to the next grade level. The authors thought to ‚Äúimagine that a major auto manufacturer had decided that they would move an auto to the next stage of the assembly line as long as the work was at least 65% complete.‚Äù (25) Just like with cars, students will not succeed without fully completing a stage in the ‚Äúassembly line‚Äù. When students partially understand the material, they pass the test, and then forget everything they just learned. Taylor and Brock believe that ==a student should completely understand the material before they are allowed to proceed to the following grade.== Teachers complain that students constantly stay they did not learn that from last year, when they did. They just forget it once the test is over. ==If education was scaled based on readiness, then students would absorb and comprehend all the information before moving onto the next grade. ==\n\u003e \n\u003e Because the schools are not putting in the effort to teach children like they should be, children are not putting in the effort as well. ==Fast food is made quickly and the same for everybody. That is what is happening with education. No matter what learning technique a student needs, everybody learns the same way.== This way of teaching leads students to solely do work to earn a good grade. No one wants to absorb new information just to gain more knowledge anymore. Students are given the material to memorize then they take a test. Once they pass the test, the curriculum exits the brain. Now, some teachers cram the lessons into their students‚Äô brains so the kids will pass and they will not get fired or in trouble for being a poor teacher because all his/her kid‚Äôs passed. In order to curve teacher‚Äôs from viewing education like this, Taylor and Brock believe in ==natural education which is when ‚Äúwe learn by experiencing, failing, working hard to make adjustments, experiencing success, and honing our skills.‚Äù== (46) This is a better method of teaching than having students memorize random facts they cannot connect to the world with. ==Education today needs to allow the students to problem solve in situations they will actually come across, not when train A leaves the station from Oregon and train B leaves the station from Boston, etc.== These authors believe that natural education will greatly benefit the future generations. \n\u003e \n\u003e Similarly to the flaws that Taylor and Brock see in education, the documentary Waiting for Superman discusses these issues. Families are taking their children out of public schools so they can have a better education. In public schools, the kids were being taught through memorization and based off the teacher‚Äôs desire to not fail, when it should be based off the teacher‚Äôs desire to inspire children. The families in the documentary feel that their children are not getting the education that they need and deserve. If Taylor and Brock‚Äôs idea of natural education was implemented in schools then maybe these families would not feel the need to pull their students out of public school. \n\u003e \n\u003e I believe that no one should have to pull their children out of public school because they do not think that their child is getting a good education. This book does a good job expressing the beliefs of the authors without being a boring book lecturing on about the problems with education. Taylor and Brock make the book relatable and thought-provoking through their real-life metaphors. Normally, I am not a fan of fiction books unless it is on a topic I am truly passionate about, but this book is the exception. \n\n[With Success In Fast Food And Fast Fashion, Is It Time For Fast Education?](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2020/10/20/with-success-in-fast-food-and-fast-fashion-is-it-time-for-fast-education/?sh=6bd18c55ce61)\n\u003e The ==digital revolution== and ==affordable internet access== arrived in the 1990s and made almost any B2C industry (always fragmented) fast. \n\n\u003e As life speeds up, ==not everyone can afford to learn that long==, so we have a trend toward faster education.\n\n\u003e ==Global digitalization== pushed many educational programs online, and these courses tend to become shorter.\n\n\u003e Fast education means ==shorter lessons==. Bite-sized learning is one of the key educational trends of the 21st century that brings comfort. You study at your own pace whenever and wherever you want. Educational courses can be divided into smaller parts so that you don‚Äôt need more than 15 minutes a day to study.\n\n\u003e You can study ==for free==, which is often time-consuming, using, for example, university courses on popular educational platforms. Alternatively, you may need to spend some time on YouTube before finding the quality trainer or course that suits you best. Or you can opt for specialized course providers that will improve your skills for a relatively small fee. \n\n\u003e Fast education will mean ==fast changes== and ==quick adaptation== of the latest trends. \n\n[Global survey reveals growing interest in shorter programmes and lifelong learning](https://monitor.icef.com/2019/10/global-survey-reveals-growing-interest-in-shorter-programmes-and-lifelong-learning/)\n\u003e As for what is prompting the shift in approach among learners, John Fallon, CEO of Pearson, says that ‚Äúthe ==new talent economy== has arrived with its gig jobs, unconventional career paths and tech disruption.‚Äù\n\n\u003e Deloitte defines the talent economy, a relatively new term, as a ==‚Äúcollaborative, transparent, technology-enabled, rapid-cycle way of doing business ‚Ä¶ where employers and employees now seek each other out on a playing field that is broader and more level than ever before.‚Äù==\n\n\u003e The quickly changing needs of today‚Äôs developed economies means that students and professionals must adjust to new trends regularly and this is prompting growing interest in ==lifelong learning ‚Äì and learning that is often undertaken piece by piece.== These pieces may be degrees or smaller, more specialised credentials that may be more affordable and may also come from different institutions and from online platforms. The result is that students are considering a much wider range of programmes, institutions, and delivery models than they ever have, and this is the opportunity Pearson is identifying.\n\nCould perhaps also apply to emerging economies like the PH?\n\u003e The Pearson study found that an understanding of the need for lifelong learning is much more established in China and India than in the US and UK, ==‚Äúdriven in large part by the influence of technology and automation on their jobs.‚Äù== These are countries where keeping up with ‚Äì or better yet staying a step ahead of ‚Äì technological trends is crucial to getting and keeping steady employment.\n\n\u003e As for which way they could imagine ==upskilling==, the largest proportions said they would do it through ‚Äúa short training programme such as a boot-camp, certificate programme, or something offered by a professional association.‚Äù \n\n[THE THIRD EDUCATION REVOLUTION\n](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2018/03/the-third-education-revolution/556091/)\n\n\u003e Now a ==third wave in education and training== has arrived, argue economists, educators, and workforce-development officials. The level of preparation that worked in the first two waves‚Äîadding more time to education early in life‚Äîdoes not seem sufficient in the 21st-century economy. Instead the third wave is likely to be ==marked by continual training throughout a person‚Äôs lifetime‚Äîto keep current in a career, to learn how to complement rising levels of automation, and to gain skills for new work.== Workers will likely consume this lifelong learning in short spurts when they need it, rather than in lengthy blocks of time as they do now when it often takes months or years to complete certificates and degrees.\n\n[[Cards/Digital learning exacerbates and reproduces inequality]]\n\u003e One big worry, however, is that the arrival of lifelong education will only ==exacerbate the economic divide== that already exists in the United States. Education levels in the U.S. are closely tied to income. Simply put: Rich kids are far more likely to graduate from college than are their poor and working-class peers. There‚Äôs no reason not to believe that trend won‚Äôt continue in this third wave of lifelong learning. It is likely to help workers who already have high levels of education get the training they need rather than assist underemployed or unemployed workers who need to upskill to keep a job or get a new one.\n\n\u003e Two simultaneous forces in the job market are driving this push toward lifelong learning. The first is ==automation== and the ==widening divide between the lifetime earnings of high-school and college graduates.==\n\n\u003e The second is the ==emergence of the gig economy==, which is reshaping the traditional employer-employee relationship as more contractors and freelancers fill roles once reserved for full-time workers making good salaries. While the term ‚Äúthe gig economy‚Äù conjures up images of popular apps for temporary work, such as Uber and Task Rabbit, the army of professional white-collar freelancers is larger than that encompassing the services we can request on our smartphones. In a 2016 study, two economists, Lawrence F. Katz and Alan B. Krueger, found that all net employment growth in the United States since 2005 appears to have come from what they termed ‚Äúalternative work‚Äù‚Äîthat is, contract and freelance work, which has ballooned by more than 50 percent over the last decade.\n\n[[Cards/Critical thinking and skill development are not mutually exclusive]]\n\u003e Rather than focus on routine skills that can be replaced by technology, job training needs to target ==key skills that complement technology, such as problem solving, teamwork, and communication.==\n\n\u003e If training and education become a lifelong pursuit, the big question is ==how to pay for it.==\n\n\u003e ‚ÄúWhile we don‚Äôt know what skills will be required for the human-centric jobs of the future such as health care, management consultants, and financial planners,‚Äù said Alssid, who has spent more than two decades in the workforce-development field, ‚Äúwe do know that these jobs will require a ==highly adaptable workforce that can think critically, creatively, and work collaboratively to find solutions to rapidly developing, complex problems.==‚Äù\n\n\u003e Such skills, often referred to as ‚Äúsoft skills,‚Äù are typically seen in liberal-arts graduates, but those individuals often lack the technical skills employers want. Alssid said ==a hybrid of liberal-arts and technical education is what is most needed in training programs to allow workers to better navigate the ambiguity of the future job market.== That‚Äôs the goal of his school‚Äôs partnership with Infosys‚Äîto introduce liberal-arts students to technical fields that they might not have previously considered, while other programs will introduce the flexibility of the liberal arts to technical workers.\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/ryancraig/2021/05/28/lambada-school-the-forbidden-coding-bootcamp/?sh=48621b2c5762\n\nhttps://www.cpp.edu/~ddwills/courses/ant352/readings352/McDonaldization.htm\n\n\u003e A further extension involves the credentialing process.

Here's some food for thought: what have you been mostly spending on during the pandemic? Have you been living on a fast food diet? How about going broke from doom-shopping? Or maybe you're trying to reinvent yourself by taking numerous courses or participating in a bootcamp? Industries are being redefined by speed and scale: fast food, fast fashion, and now fast food education. Powered by technology, it's capable of disrupting the ancient higher education sector. It's great that more people than ever can pursue learning, right? But what is being marketed as empowerment can also be masqueraded exploitation. Let's explore this rising trend, from its origins to its implications.\n#### What is fast food education?\nFast food education is education influenced by what sociologist George Ritzer calls \"[[Cards/McDonaldization]]\": a rationalization process where principles of the fast food industry are dominating other sectors of society and the world. There are four characteristics of this worldview: efficiency, calculability, predictability, and control.\n\nFirst, **efficiency** is about choosing the fastest and least costly (in expenditure and effort) way to achieve a goal. This is specific to the interests of the industry/business, but usually advertised as a benefit to the consumer. However, they end up doing work that was previously done for them. This is the \"privilege\" they pay for; not only through paying higher prices, but also through spending time remembering numbers and learning new technologies.\n\nNext, **calculability** is about making objectives based on what can be calculated, counted, quantified. Under [[Cards/McDonaldization]], quanity equals quality; a large amount of product delivered to consumers is the same as a high quality product. Because of this, workers are judged by the speed at which they accomplish tasks instead of the quality of work they do. \n\nThen,  **predictability** is about reducing the possibility of surprise and differentness in an environment as much as possible. Consumers expect to receive the same product and service no matter where they go. Meanwhile, workers are always doing repetitive and highly routine tasks. People don't vary from the norm because they expect to profit, whether it be through a good meal or an okay salary.\n\nFinally, **control** is about replacing people ‚Äî the biggest source of uncertanity and unpredictability in a rationalizing system ‚Äî with nonhuman technology. Standardization is at play. Everything is pre-packaged, pre-measured, and automatically controlled. Thus, consumers and workers no longer have to think; all they have to do is follow instructions and push buttons ‚Äî just like a machine.\n\n[[Cards/McDonaldization]] has expressed itself in the education sector through [[Cards/Vocational education]]. It's known for a short timeframe, accessible costs, and a practical curriculum ‚Äî promising a career that liberal education couldn't guarantee. For this essay, I'll be focusing on example programs that are prominent in the edtech industry: compressed courses like MooCs and micro-credentials, and skills-based intensives such as bootcamps and cohort-based courses.\n\n(Maybe I should make a graph of fast food education with example startups?)\n\n##### Rise in popularity\nThese programs are part of what Selingo calls the [third education revolution](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2018/03/the-third-education-revolution/556091/): continual training throughout a person's lifetime. This has been brought about by the following forces: technological developments, the wage gap between college graduates and those with \"lesser education\", and the talent economy. \n\nFirst, technology has always served as the backbone of innovation. For instance, [fragmented B2C industries became fast thanks to the internet](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2020/10/20/with-success-in-fast-food-and-fast-fashion-is-it-time-for-fast-education/?sh=6bd18c55ce61) -- it made buying anything a few clicks away. Now, the same is happening to education; lessons are no longer taught in classrooms, but in videos and Zooms. This shift to remote learning has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Since education is more accessible, there's no excuse not to be learning.\n\nAnother technological driver of the third education revolution is automation. The wage gap between college graduates and those with \"lesser education\" continues to widen because of the fear that their jobs could end up automated. This worry isn't baseless; according to a [McKinsey report](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2018/03/the-third-education-revolution/556091/), this could happen to at least one-third of activities in about 60 percent of occupations by 2030. So to avoid losing their jobs, people have no choice but to upskill.\n\nFinally, there's the emergence of the [talent economy](https://monitor.icef.com/2019/10/global-survey-reveals-growing-interest-in-shorter-programmes-and-lifelong-learning/), which Deloitte defines as a ‚Äúcollaborative, transparent, technology-enabled, rapid-cycle way of doing business ‚Ä¶ where employers and employees now seek each other out on a playing field that is broader and more level than ever before\". This no longer includes just app-enabled gig workers, but also professional white-collar freelancers. Since today's economies have quickly changing needs, people need to adjust to new trends -- leading them to constant retraining.\n\nThe third education revolution is more pronounced in the Global South, especially Southeast Asia. According to a [Parthenon-EY paper](http://cdn.ey.com/parthenon/pdf/perspectives/Parthenon-EY_SE-Asia_Paper_final_092016_singles.pdf), economic growth, demographic trends, and cultural shifts have prompted regional demand for higher education. However, [socio-economic barriers](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/features/south-east-asia-higher-educations-next-global-hotspot) such as a global recession, outdated infrastructure, and political instability  have made higher education an inaccessible/undesirable option. Automation also has a huge influence; in fact, [many Southeast Asians](https://reboothq.substack.com/p/maintenance) participate in [ghost work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_work): the invisible human labor that powers the products and services of Silicon Valley. Thus, keeping up with technogical trends is integral to getting and staying employed.\n\nOverall, technological and economic developments have pushed people to pursue lifelong learning, but traditional institutions are unable to respond to the high demand due to expensive costs, long timeframes, and slow adaptation. In a [global Pearson study](https://monitor.icef.com/2019/10/global-survey-reveals-growing-interest-in-shorter-programmes-and-lifelong-learning/), less than six in ten respondents felt that their country's education system worked well for the current generation; more than four in ten respondents (in affulent countries like Australia, Canada, and the US) believed that higher education did not prepare them for their career. Now is a perfect time for disruption, which is why fast food education is currently thriving. \n\n#### Empowerment or exploitation?\nThere's no denying the benefits of fast food education. Compared to liberal education, it's more affordable in terms of time and cost spent. Its remote nature also opens it to people all over the world. The increased accessibility helps educate, train, and empower populations previously denied access to similar opportunities, like the Global South. This also reduces the magnitude of \"brain drain\" by allowing students to gain expertise locally, instead of having to migrate. As a result, the number of countries' highly skilled workers can be increased.\n\nBut no matter how much education is rationalized, there are bound to be irrational outcomes. Ritzer says: \"...Rational systems are unreasonable systems...they deny the basic humanity, the human reason, of the people who work within or are served by them.\" Aside from dehumanization, other irrationalities can occur (e.g. overquantification resulting to low quality). Here are the cons of fast food education:\n\n##### Questionable quality\nIn exchange for accessibility, fast food education is known for lower quality, from what is taught to how it is taught. Since it has a short timeframe, it can only focus on teaching practical skills and methods. For example: programs that teach code [favor convention over configuration (frameworks over fundamentals)](https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/bootcamps-wont-make-you-coder-heres-what-will-0), while those that teach UX design [skip foundational disciplines like anthropology and art history](https://essays.uxdesign.cc/case-study-factory/). These programs' curriculums aren't only lacking; they also have the danger of being unreliable. See Lambda School, who was criticized by their students for [constantly changing lesson plans and relying on free training materials](https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21131848/lambda-school-coding-bootcamp-isa-tuition-cost-free).\n\nDelivery of content is also important. One example is technical production; third-party providers have put their reputations at risk for [insufficient screening](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/reputations-at-risk-as-platforms-fail-to-screen-moocs/2014381.article), leading to the release of courses with shaky filming and conventional slides. Pacing must also be considered, of which MOOCs and bootcamps seem to be on opposite sides of the spectrum. The former is completely dependent on learners; most end up dropping out, leading to [completion rates lower than 10%](https://www.fastcompany.com/3021473/udacity-sebastian-thrun-uphill-climb). Meanwhile, the latter is known for being rapidly fast, so learners have to ensure that they can catch up.\n\nEven if one gets to finish a program, is the certificate they earned enough to prove what they learned? This would be difficult without accreditation; while this lack of oversight has enabled programs to constantly update their curriculums, it has also lessened their credibility -- which job-seeking students would benefit from. If [graduates already struggle with interviews](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2016-12-06/want-a-job-in-silicon-valley-keep-away-from-coding-schools), how else can they ensure that they would be hired? Students of fast food education will be at a disadvantage in the current market, which is more competitive than ever thanks to globalization and the internet.\n\n##### Homogenization\nOur global market mandates the idea of universal knowledge, skills, and values. The fact that coding bootcamps are an international phenonemon is proof of this; no matter what country they're in, they'll always be providing technical skills and interview prep. Through this standardization, fast food education brings about [cultural hybridization](https://sociologydictionary.org/cultural-hybridization/): the process of blending of two or more cultures in order to fit cultural norms. Allowing for variety speeds up historical, economic, and cultural development. However, cultural hybridization is becoming no different from [cultural hegemony](https://www.thoughtco.com/cultural-hegemony-3026121), where dominance is maintained through ideological/cultural means. In the case of fast food education, the Global North (especially countries in the West), is set as the universal standard for others to follow. As a result, students are subject to the homogenization of their work.\n\n(lol insert collage of coding bootcamp landing pages to show how similar they are....get some originality please LMAO)\n\nAn example of cultural hemegonization is [\"What can we learn from the new generation of designers?\"](https://youtu.be/YCsSKDh8gBg), where Lucas Coehlo talks about how he associated \"good design\" with his Euro-centric aesthetic of minimalist design, and was only able to question it because of a PoC junior. Who can blame him? Abundant white space may be a standard for quality design, but it can't be afforded by low-end magazines and East Asian media. Many design theories also happen to come from white males born decades ago. Due to standardization and fast pacing, fast food education programs limits their students' perspectives.\n\nTheir expression is also limited; student projects are often made with structured templates. For instance, [\"The case study factory\"](https://essays.uxdesign.cc/case-study-factory/) discusses how formulaic case studies make it difficult to diffrentiate UX/UI designers from one another. These studies may demonstrate the students' ability to follow the design process, but not their unique thinking, skills, and point of view. Having English as the main language adds to this. Minorities who aren't able to communicate well in it are sure to struggle, even if they are proficient in the craft. Overall, even if [imposing the logic of factory production on education kills creativity](http://bostonreview.net/forum/higher-education-age-coronavirus/r-h-lossin-andy-battle-resisting-distance-learning), those who fail comply to set standards will be seen as of \"lesser quality\".\n\n##### Equity problems\nFast food education may be more accessible to more people, but is it equitable? According to education researchers Mimi Ito and Justin Reich, digital learning technologies actually exacerbate inequality in learning outcomes in terms of class, race, and gender. They also unintentionally reproduce inequality, thanks to bias and social distance between creators and users. (See [[Cards/Digital learning exacerbates and reproduces inequality]])\n\nSociologist Paul Attwell argues that inequalities operate at two levels: the first and second digital divides. The former divide is about access: who is able to get devices, software, connectivity, and other forms of technology. To those without reliable internet (from [Seattle](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/disconnected-in-isolation-how-the-coronavirus-pandemic-shed-light-on-the-digital-divide/) to [Southeast Asia](https://phys.org/news/2020-03-lack-internet-access-southeast-asia.html)), remote learning is a far-off opportunity. The latter divide is about leverage; when poor and affulent students are given the same technologies, the former tend to use it for basic skills, while the latter were using it for higher forms of learning. Those who enroll in [MOOCs](https://outline.com/V2LCFh) and [bootcamps](https://www.insidehighered.com/views/2017/08/29/essay-how-coding-boot-camps-are-add-college-degree) tend to be well-off college graduates who already have jobs.\n\nMoney is also a barrier. Despite being marketed as the \"more affordable\" option, [bootcamps can cost in the range of $5,000 to $20,000](https://careerkarma.com/blog/bootcamp-market-report-2021/#bootcamp-costs-and-financing) ‚Äî nothing to cough at. Even the way cheaper [MOOCs are used to advertise higher priced professional programs](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereknewton/2018/11/19/beware-of-the-great-mooc-bait-and-switch/?sh=16d6f5c312f2). Income sharing agreements are marketed as an accessible option to those who aren't able to pay full price, but people need to be warned that ISAs are just another form of student debt; [Senator Elizabeth Warren](https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Letter%20to%20DeVos%20re%20ISAs.pdf) says that these carry many of the pitfalls of private student loans \"with the added danger of deceptive rhetoric and marketing that obscure their true nature\". Just because students get to study for free doesn't mean it didn't cost them. [A report on Lambda School students](https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21131848/lambda-school-coding-bootcamp-isa-tuition-cost-free) showed that some quit their jobs to attend full-time, while others worked nights and weekends in order to make ends meet. Many also admitted to struggling with mental health problems. When students have to deal with looming debt and [dubious placement outcomes](https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/bootcamps-wont-make-you-coder-heres-what-will-0), who can blame them for being disstressed?\n\n\nThese programs were created for a honorable purpose: to bring learning to those who couldn't access it. However, after years have passed, very little has changed. Those who gain the most from these programs are those who are predisposed to succeed. Meanwhile, those who need educational resources the most gain the least. Why is it this way? Where did we go wrong?\n\n#### System over student\nRemember: fast food education is designed to benefit the system, not the student. This system is [Lower Ed](https://tressiemc.com/uncategorized/the-lower-ed-ecosystem-bootcamps-edition/): a term coined by writer Tressie McMillian Cottom to refer to a sociological process of credentialism; its ecosystem includes programs such as microcredentials and bootcamps. According to her, Lower Ed was created by structural changes in the way we work, unequal access to liberal education programs, and the risk shift of job training from institutions to individuals for profit. Thus, it's exploitative in nature; it makes use of students' faith in education without challenging its market imperatives, and maintains race, class, and gender inequalities. \n\nStudents also lose out because of the curricula.  Its focus on hard skills and technical competencies is effective for producing workers, not well-rounded people. After all, according to [Udacity CEO Sebastian Thrun](https://www.fastcompany.com/3021473/udacity-sebastian-thrun-uphill-climb), \"... the true value proposition of education is employment.\" Yes, these programs may be great at creating jobs and boosting the economy. But their students are unable to think for themselves, leaving them condemned to forever serve their industrial and corporate bosses. \n\nYet, the students think of themselves as [saviors](https://www.stanforddaily.com/2018/02/16/silicon-valleys-saviorism-problem/). Living in a world where technical skills are sought after has led them to believe that they know what's best for others, especially marginalized communities. But the savior mindset is patronizing; it assumes that people are helpless just because they lack technical skills. Making solutions *for*, and not *with* people in need only ends up hurting them, perpetuating existing inequalities. ==opportunity for some nice tech x religion imagery here... startup bible...lol==\n\nOverall, fast food education upholds the status quo. Companies keep growing their talent and profits. Technology continues being evangelized like religion. And people keep getting dehumanized. [Researcher Matthew Kiem](https://modesofcriticism.org/the-imperial-code/) states that those who are technical are divided according to their dispensability; worse are those who aren't technical at all, seen as deficient. It's sad to see that despite being capable of building the future, students are only maintaining this kind of present.\n\n#### Call-to-action\n\"... The object of all true education is not to make [people] carpenters, but to make carpenters [people],\" said [sociologist W. E. B. Du Bois](https://glc.yale.edu/talented-tenth-excerpts). This is what fast food education should strive for. Democratizing technical skills is important, but developing these shouldn't be incompatible with cultivating critical thinking in students. To see how this can be achieved, let's take a look at [Tech Learning Collective](https://techlearningcollective.com/), an apprenticeship-based technology school which presents itself as an anti-bootcamp.\n\n[It approaches technology like gardening.](https://techlearningcollective.com/2019/07/22/want-to-get-good-with-computers-dont-start-with-code.html) One, its curriculum is focused on foundational skill building; the land must first be fertile before a garden can bloom on it. Instead of immediately teaching a coding language, instructors start with teaching digital infrastructure (e.g. security, networking, system administration). These basics are vital to programming; without sufficient understanding of infrastructure, developers write programs with more bugs and less functionality. By going back to their digital roots, students become more aware of their immediate environment. Numerous possibilities open up when these students realize they can do or make what they're being pressured to pay for (e.g. Big Tech v.s. open source).\n\nThe school also advocates for cross-pollination. Their workshops are interdisciplinary, melding technical topics with the humanities (e.g history, philosophy, social sciences). This allows for a more holistic development for the students. For instance, just like all the other courses, [cybersecurity has an explicitly political approach](https://techlearningcollective.com/2019/08/10/how-we-approach-cybersecurity-topics-at-the-tech-learning-collective.html). They prioritize teaching security first because of their target audience (activists are part) and numerous scandals (e.g. [2016 election \"hacking\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2016_United_States_elections), [Cambridge Analytica data mining](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/mar/17/the-cambridge-analytica-scandal-changed-the-world-but-it-didnt-change-facebook)). They also cultivate critical thinking by encouraging their students to scruitinize technology from an ethical standpoint. \n\nStated by Tech Learning Collective: \"...Our primary inquiries in...classes consider how we can leverage our digital devices for the most immediate social good...much like the advice encouraging you to eat foods whose ingredients you can pronounce and grown on soil you have left your footprints on, we believe that our engagement with technology ought to be as directly integrated as possible with our everyday lives...\" Thanks to their technological and political immersion, their students reclaim power over the work they do, getting to truly flourish. They will be truly capable of shaping the system we are all stuck in.\n\nPerhaps it's too ambitious to hold fast food education to the standards of a fine dining experience. But being responsible for the development of many is nothing to make light of, especially if they've been disenfranchised by society. [Education is not a product, but a process](https://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/just-visiting/moocs-are-dead-whats-next-uh-oh?cmdid=F31RY86F0UQCL1). What they get shouldn't be packaged shallow content, but rather building blocks to help them grow (just like nutritional food!). In short, democratizing holistic tech education is what is truly innovation. With all that the edtech industry is capable of, that hopefully won't be such a tall order to fill. ==(weak ending aaahhh)==\n\n--- \n## Cathexis\n### Curation\n#### Amazing Art\n+ **[Cognition diary:](https://www.behance.net/gallery/105592711/cognition-diary-2020)** A speculative design project by Lera Ganicheva, Cognition diary is a personalized learning tool and a knowledge base designed by people individually throughout their lives. It takes the form of a customizable VR space where buildings represent disciplines studied by the user. I love embodied learning (thanks to being both an educator and a dancer), so I also loved the concept behind this project! I hope to create a speculative design project of my own one day as well. Check out the full project here.\n+ **[Classroom design explorations:](https://twitter.com/azlenelza/status/1457346877163143170)** What would a classroom look like if it wasn't teacher-led, but instead teacher-curated? Azlen Ezla explores this in these sketches, rethinking learning environments. As someone who struggles to sit still in a typical classroom, I am excited by the possibilities these sketches offer. \n#### Interesting Innovations\n+ **Teaching Machines:** https://www.edsurge.com/news/2021-06-15-new-book-explores-the-long-and-surprising-history-of-teaching-machines Automation is no stranger to education. Way before the advent of personal computers, inventors and researchers created \"teaching machines\" for revolutionizing education. In her book Teaching Machines, Audrey Watters argues  that this history is important for current educators \u0026 policy leaders to know. This quote of hers from an interview particularly struck me:\n\n\u003e ‚ÄúI wanted to tell a story that didn‚Äôt have anything to do with computers,‚Äù she says, noting how mechanical early teaching machines were. ‚ÄúBecause I think that too often in edtech, we get so hung up on the tech,‚Äù she adds. ‚ÄúWe're so committed to talking about the latest gadget, the new software, this or that app, that we really act as though somehow it's that the tech is all there is to talk about. That the tech is the driving force of change. That the tech is the driving force of history.‚Äù\n\nYou can check out the whole book here. \n+ **[Khan Academy Early Product Development / Long-term Research:](https://early.khanacademy.org/)** Combining practices from product design, academic research, and pedagogy, Khan Academy's experimental R\u0026D group sought to explore and uncover future possibilities in education. 3 years of experimentation resulted in interesting reports on building complex reasoning skills, exploring creative math, and more! I admire how 1.) intersectional this research is (I want to do similar work in the future) and 2.) it's open-source! Read all the reports here.\n+ **[Para-/Extra-Institutional Schools:](https://www.are.na/shannon-mattern/para-extra-institutional-schools)** Curated by Shannon Mattern, this channel is a wealth of initiatives that seek to reimagine education. I don't know about you, but I'm nerding out over these; I get excited thinking about how these alternative models of education can be brought over to the Philippines! Check out the full channel here. \n#### Rabbit Hole Reads\n+ **[Ten Expeditionary Learning Principles:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Hahn#Ten_Expeditionary_Learning_Principles)** Drawn from the ideas of Kurt Hahn and other education leaders, The Ten Expeditionary Learning Principles seek to describe a caring, adventurous school culture and approach to learning. I love how concise these are, and I plan to incorporate them into my own learning philosophy. You can check out all the principles here. \n+ **[We Don't Need No Innovation:](https://logicmag.io/kids/we-dont-need-no-innovation/)** Written by Phil Nichols, this essay illustrates how a fight over school reforms in West Philadelphia revealed the pathologies and possibilities of disrupting education. Reading this made me rethink what it means to be innovative. I particularly like this last line: \n\u003e \"If 'innovation' is to be anything more than a buzzword‚Äîor a Trojan horse for austerity measures, urban development, and workforce production‚Äîit must be rooted in such a commitment to the self-determination and flourishing of the publics that schools are meant to serve.\"\n\nRead the whole essay here. \n+ **[The Future of Education:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0uw7Xc0fLk\u0026list=TLPQMTQxMDIwMjFLzdGjbz6JuQ\u0026index=4)** In this talk with Russell Brand, Yuval Noah Harari shared his thoughts on the future of humanity, talking about the challenges facing the next generation (and how they might be overcome). This whole conversation was a delight to listen to! A lot of gems, like this line: \"Many jobs are not worth saving - what we need to protect is not the jobs but the humans.\" You can watch the full talk here.\n+ **[Education in Posthuman Times:](https://twitter.com/KaySocLearn/status/1463904737821143047)** A lecture intertwining education and philosophy? Sign me up! To be honest, I haven't fully listened to this yet, but I'm already intrigued by what I've seen, especially this quote from a 'becoming-manifesto' for posthuman education at the beginning:\n\u003e \"Posthuman education...creates spaces where we can be outside ourselves, be inside ourselves, be something else, be outside, be inside, be elsewhere but there, be not ourselves, be not a self at all but something and nothing all at the same time. Where a learner feels the learning somewhere along the pain to joy spectrum but sees the neurons fire either way; where the trees speak and the earth groans and the machines and the selves hear and listen to the wisdom of all of it and everything that is and sometimes is not.\"\n\nYou can watch the full lecture here.\n#### Wise Words\n+ Wondering what the current state of humanity would be like if schools weren't designed to limit us...\nhttps://twitter.com/mollyfmielke/status/1452719727550222337\n","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.203608101Z","tags":null},"/Atlas/Projects/Level-Up":{"title":"Level Up","content":"![Educational Metaverse](https://media.wired.com/photos/617af404123f968d359c5ec4/master/pass/Gear-Meta-Education-1.gif)\n## Sources\nSee them all in this essay's [Are.na board](https://www.are.na/bianca-aguilar/level-up-essay)\n+ [[Sources/The Minecraft Generation - Essay]]\n+ [[Sources/Its time to build - A New Worlds Fair - Essay]]\n+ [[Sources/The Rise and Fall of Internet Art Communities - Essay]]\n+ [[Sources/On Roblox Kids Learn Its Hard to Earn Money Making Games - Essay]]\n+ [[Sources/Capitalism in virtual worlds - Essay]]\n+ [[Sources/Fortnite and Minecraft are getting kids excited about learning again - Essay]]\n+ [[Sources/Why the Metaverse Matters - Essay]]\n+ [[Sources/13 Principles of Web3 - Thread]]\n+ [[Sources/A Digtial Yggdrasil - Education as a Public Good - Proposal]]\n+ [[Sources/Content, Services, and Asset Businesses in the Metaverse - Essay]]\n+ [Web3's Educational Potential](https://mobile.twitter.com/courtlandleer/status/1448797069909635072)\n+ [[Sources/Deschooling Society - Book]]\n+ [[Sources/Gamification vs Pointsification - Essay]]\n+ [[Sources/Is the Metaverse Finally Emerging - Essay]]\n+ [[Sources/The Internet As Your Resume - Essay]]\n+ [[Sources/Computers and Creativity - Thesis]]\n+ [[Sources/Video Games are the Future of Education - Essay]]\n+ Ughh as much as I don't like Meta...

Introduction\n\t\t1. \"You'll find the future wherever people are having the most fun.\" - Steven Johnson, *Wonderland: How Play Made the Modern World*\n\t\t2. Talk about own personal story \n\t\t\t1. As a kid, I had fun in the Internet through games and art communities -\u003e all about creation\n\t\t\t2. E.G. creating graphics, roleplaying -\u003e creating stories\n\t\t\t3. Transition to present time, where I'm benefitting from skills I gained through fun exploration, not structured education (i.e. art and design)\n\t\t3. Now, I see kids around me growing the same way... (cite examples)\n\t\t\t1. future developers learning programming through games like Roblox + Minecraft\n\t\t\t2. future artists practicing drawing + marketing through fandom communities in Twitter, Tumblr, Discord, etc.\n\t\t4. These [Present-day hobbies will seed future industries](https://cdixon.org/2013/03/02/what-the-smartest-people-do-on-the-weekend-is-what-everyone-else-will-do-during-the-week-in-ten-years)\n\t\t5. So why aren't these hobbies taken seriously? It's because schools are still seen as the #1 venue of a person's development. However, there's more to learning than what can be found in school; here's how schools fail students, and how online spaces can make up for this ‚Äî especially those powered by web3.\n\t4. How do schools fail students?\n\t\t1. Packaging instruction with certification; linking instruction (not learning) to social role assignment\n\t\t\t1. Definitions\n\t\t\t\t1. Learning = acquiring new skill/insight \n\t\t\t\t2. Promotion = social role assignment, depends on others' opinions\n\t\t\t\t3. Instruction = choice of circumstances that facilitate learning\n\t\t\t2. With school, role assignment is linked to instruction, not learning\n\t\t\t\t1. Done through a curriculum of conditions a student must meet (i.e grades)\n\t\t\t\t2. Not reasonable: doesn't link relevant competencies to roles, but instead the process by which these are acquired\n\t\t\t\t3. Not liberating: those who benefit the most from instruction are those who fit social norms (e.g. affulent, neurotypical)\n\t\t\t3. Even alternative education models (e.g. bootcamps, accelerators) have the same faults\n\t\t\t\t1. need to complete specified criteria in order to \"graduate\"\n\t\t\t\t2. certification/brand as main value prop\n\t\t2. Assuming that most learning is the result of teaching\n\t\t\t1. Most of the time, people acquire their knowledge not from what's intentionally taught in school, but what they casually encounter outside it\n\t\t\t\t1. Learning happens as a by-product of some other activity (e.g. reading fluency comes from frequently reading for pleasure)\n\t\t\t2. Thus, the way people learn in schools isn't optimally designed for them\n\t\t\t\t1. Centralization/standardization\n\t\t\t\t\t1. the scale of a school is inversely correlated with its curriculum quality, especially creative support\n\t\t\t\t2. Not rewarding failure (best way to learn)\n\t\t\t\t\t1. students aren't able to grow as much due to lack of feedback\n\t\t\t\t\t2. afraid to explore\n\t\t\t\t3. Punitive assessments\n\t\t\t\t4. Rewarding rote work\n\t\t\t\t5. Atomizing subjects\n\t\t\t\t\t1. we learn about topics in silos, when in real life everything is integrated with each other\n\t5. How do alternatives such as virtual communities (especially those found in video games) serve them?\n\t\t1. Gives students an environment + tools where they can make discoveries themselves. \n\t\t\t1. Choose your own adventure: students can choose what they learn and how they learn it, instead of having to deal with the standardized way of learning things\n\t\t\t2. Provide space, time, and autonomy that schools do not\n\t\t2. Simulate reality + provide fast feedback loops\n\t\t\t1. more context = deeper understanding\n\t\t\t2. feedback mainly provided through real-time + async discussions with other members\n\t\t\t3. outputs/outcomes are tangible, directly related to the skills you learn \n\t\t\t\t1. E.G. github repos to code, pieces to art, etc\n\t\t\t4. digital data (e.g. social media metrics) can also help w/ feedback\n2. However, current systems still exploit or underserve these youth, just like in education\n\t1. Creators don't get to profit from their work, only platforms\n\t\t1. E.G. developers on Roblox find it hard to earn due to friction claiming profits + huge pay cut; creatives on social media are at the mercy of the algorithm\n\t2. IRL inequality is elevated thanks to digital divide\n\t\t1. those who can't rely on their own devices or connectivity won't be able to benefit from these spaces as much\n\t\t2. The premium experience reserved for those who can afford it; free members don't get these benefits unless they work for it\n\t\t\t\t\t1. E.G. memberships, virtual goods\n\t3. how can we tackle these problems?  let's get abstract\n3. **Finite -\u003e infinite games**\n\t1. Recap: I believe that the youth learn best in games (after all, we humans are Homo Ludens ‚Äî born players). But I don't necessarily just mean video games. I'm talking about the games we play in life. \n\t2. According to James Carse, there are two types of games: finite, which is played for the purpose of winning, and infinite, which is played for the purpose of continuing play. \n\t3. Thanks to society, most of us are playing finite games\n\t\t1. Players have to parade around their wealth and status\n\t\t2. Examples\n\t\t\t1. URL\n\t\t\t\t1.  reaching the top of leaderboards\n\t\t\t\t2.  getting reach: X followers, X likes, X shares, etc...\n\t\t\t2. IRL \n\t\t\t\t1. scoring the highest salary\n\t\t\t\t2. founding the next top startup  \n\t\t3. This has been encouraged by our existing educational environments\n\t\t\t1. Schools\n\t\t\t2. Even online platforms\n\t4. It's time for us to approach life as an infinite game\n\t\t1. The pursuit of excellence is a positive-sum game, with no finish line and no losers.\n\t\t2. Examples (according to [Kevin Kelly](https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Finite_vs._Infinite_Games))\n\t\t\t1. Evolution, life, mind, and the technium (accumulation of inventions that humans have created)\n\t\t\t2. The things in life we love most -- including life itself -- are infinite games.\n\t\t3. Instead of playing within boundaries, players play with the boundaries.\n\t\t\t1. May Li Khoe: instead of thinking of life as a series of checks, see it as a canvas which you can paint anyway you like. the status quo needs to change, and life is short. Thus, we need to [joyfully subvert the status quo](https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-1/joyful-subversion/) \n\t\t4. Creation + collaboration \u003e quantification + competition\n\t\t\t1. the online spaces I was a part of encouraged these values\n\t\t5. I believe that Web3 is the key to this shift\n4. **Why and how we could benefit from a Web3 powered future**\n\t1. In a Web3 powered future, education is an (infinite) game. What does this even mean? Or look like?\n\t\t1. What does web3-powered mean?\n\t\t\t1. [In web3, interactions in application/software are done through wallets](https://twitter.com/gaby_goldberg/status/1449002871706501133)\n\t\t\t2. In web3, users reclaim ownership of the internet due to decentralization\n\t\t\t\t1. Web2: \"Our consumption is driven by black-box algorithmic feeds, our work and property are only ours to borrow, and our value creation has been severely discredited. We don't own any of our digital properties, and we've been wired to accept it.\"\n\t\t\t\t2. Web3: now we can have control over...\n\t\t\t\t\t1. our work + property -\u003e NFTs\n\t\t\t\t\t2. platforms we participate in -\u003e  protocols, and the way they structure incentives\n\t\t2. Web3 is helping build the foundation of the Metaverse\n\t\t\t1. What is the Metaverse? \"the next iteration of the Internet that brings a sense of place and facilitates rich human connection.\"\n\t\t\t2. Already being done in Web2 through social [spatial software](https://darkblueheaven.com/spatialsoftware/) E.G. platforms like Gather and games like Roblox and Fornite\n\t\t3. How is education connected with this?\n\t\t\t1.  We're now entering an age of [embedded education](https://fakepixels.substack.com/p/fkpxls-special-volume-embedded-education), where learning happens everywhere instead of being limited to individual platforms\n\t\t\t\t1.  People learn through encounters they have through systems that may exist for non-educational purposes \n\t\t\t\t2.  E.G. Communities centered around products, teaching others how to make the most out of it through shared resources, discussions, etc -\u003e Figma, Notion\n\t\t\t\t3.  Thus, learning feels more natural\n\t\t\t2.  The Metaverse provides the perfect educational environment by...\n\t\t\t\t1.  immersive; simulates reality\n\t\t\t\t\t1.  shortened feedback loops from theory to practice: instead of reading about a topic, you experience it for yourself\n\t\t\t\t2.  brings together people wth diverse ideas and interests, without the barriers of physical location\n\t\t\t\t\t1.  more equitable and effective distribution of knowledge, skills, and information\n\t\t4. An educational metaverse would be the ultimate digital creative tool (according to [[Sources/Computers and Creativity - Thesis]])\n\t\t\t1. To foster optimal human innovation, digital creative tools need to be interoperable, moldable, efficient, and community-driven.\n\t\t\t\t1. Interopability: the ability for different computers to connect and exchange information\n\t\t\t\t\t1. people's works are no longer confined to singular platforms/tools\n\t\t\t\t\t2. this allows for more collaboration and innovation\n\t\t\t\t2. Moldability: the ability for the user to tailor their software to better address the problem they are trying to solve\n\t\t\t\t\t1. customizability enables creativity\n\t\t\t\t3. Efficiency\n\t\t\t\t\t1. [The metaverse is infrastructure](https://venturebeat.com/2021/11/18/the-metaverse-is-infrastructure/)\n\t\t\t\t\t2. Makes real-time communication, managing presence, earning money, etc. easier\n\t\t\t\t4. Community-driven\n\t\t\t\t\t1. the people within in the metaverse is what brings it to life (i.e. content generation, community building)\n\t\t\t2. These tools hold potential as co-creators with human-beings. Tools of this type would lower the barrier to entry and make all users toolmakers and owners in an expanded definition of technological innovation.\n\t\t\t\t1. \"If the purpose of education is to inspire courage to expand our collective understanding of the world, the vision of Embedded Education is that every time we see something that inspires us, the path to actualizing this new-found dream starts right where we find it.\"\n\t2. The youth are already primed for this future; being immersed in digital worlds helps us transition to virtual systems. [How?](https://twitter.com/brianjcho/status/1459176570174672897)\n\t\t1. (Value) Creation/Contribution\n\t\t\t1. used to working for status/rewards\n\t\t\t\t1. E.G. levelling up by grinding through quests, or by commenting enough (Top Fan) \n\t\t\t2. native to virtual currencies -\u003e tokens \u0026 wallets\n\t\t\t3. used to virtual goods -\u003e NFTs\n\t\t\t4.  willing to put up with learning curve just to have fun\n\t\t\t5.  constant remixing \u0026 modding -\u003e composability\n\t\t\t\t1. not just seen in game mods, but in social media e.g. Dribbble remixes, Tiktok duets\n\t\t2. Community\n\t\t\t1.  power-users of guilds/forums/Discord -\u003e DAOs\n\t\t\t2.  vocal + passionate user base -\u003e community-led governance\n\t\t\t\t1.  E.G. moderators of forums\n\t\t3. Culture \n\t\t\t1. internet identities -\u003e anonymity/psuedonymity/reputation\n\t\t\t2. internet memes + language -\u003e web3 memes + language\n\t3. How can we create this future?\n\t\t1. This educational metaverse must be a public good\n\t\t\t1. Non-rivalrous: accessible to everybody; one person's use of the good does not impact its availability to others\n\t\t\t\t1. intensive learning experiences like fellowships and bootcamps are inherently rivalrous, since more people = less quality interaction\n\t\t\t2. Non-excludable: it should be impossible to exclude anybody from using the good\n\t\t\t\t1. \tCost of money, time, literacy, etc. can exclude others\n\t\t2. Creating this metaverse needs game design (integrated), not gamification (just added-on)\n\t\t\t1. Gamification is often pointsification, which is all about external motivation\n\t\t\t\t1.  E.G. points, badges, leaderboards; a.k.a. a finite game\n\t\t\t\t2.  this isn't sustainable; doesn't work for building actual skills long-term\n\t\t\t2.  Games are their best when they're played out of genuine interest; same should apply for participants of this metaverse. There must be:\n\t\t\t\t1.  A goal/specific outcome that provides players with a sense of purpose\n\t\t\t\t2.  Rules that place limitations on how players can achieve the goal\n\t\t\t\t3.  A feedback system that tells players how close they are to achieving their goal\n\t\t\t\t4.  Voluntary participation\n\t4. What other challenges must be overcome?\n\t\t1. Technological challenges\n\t\t\t1. Internet infrastructure\n\t\t\t2. Feasability of having large numbers of participants interact with one another in real-time\n\t\t\t3. Language barriers\n\t\t\t4. Latency issues\n\t\t2. Misc. challenges (i.e. social, economic)\n\t\t\t1. Personal privacy\n\t\t\t\t1. Do we really want to make everything we learn visible on the blockchain?\n\t\t\t2. Marketplace competition\n\t\t\t3. Misinformation\n\t5. What does living this future looks like? (speculative)\n\t\t1. Told through the perspective of a  teacher onboarding students into this metaverse\n\t\t\t1. Vibes: The Magic School Bus? Hhahahaha\n\t\t\t2. This teacher doesn't have a traditional background; even if they weren't professionally licensed as a teacher, their IRL experience + skills made them qualified\n\t\t2. They get started with creating their identity. Thanks to wallets, they have their own profile and inventory\n\t\t\t1. This is a dynamic resume: everything you learn is shown on-chain\n\t\t\t2. This is a passport to web3 applications; whether it's through consumption, curation, publication, or investing, it'll show your online travels\n\t\t3. How to build identity: students are able to explore by completing quests/bounties that interest them, and getting rewarded \n\t\t4. The teacher transports them to an introductory quest (that they designed themselves), an immersive environment where they do a Giant [Tower Building Challenge](https://www.wickedproblemsolver.com/blog-2/blog-post-title-two-tk47y), where they have to build the tallest freestanding structure\n\t\t5. This experience introduces them to collaboration, and how the metaverse is driven by community-driven culture\n\t\t\t1. DAOs acting like guilds, onboarding new students and helping them level up in this game\n\t\t\t2. Free/open-source syllabi\n\t\t\t\t1. Anyone can contribute materials and get rewarded\n\t\t\t\t2. Everyone's always remixing...building on each other's works\n\t\t\t\t\t1. Info overload + quality control is a problem...curators are elevated, can also become teachers\n\t\t6. All students get a POAP (Proof of Attendance Protocol) for completing onboarding!\n\t\t7. Ends on a hopeful note? Maybe the teacher saying how they're excited to see their students' journeys of lifelong learning? ahhaha\n\n## Draft 1\n\u003e \"You'll find the future wherever people are having the most fun.\" ‚Äî Steven Johnson, *Wonderland: How Play Made the Modern World*\n\nAs a kid who grew up on the Internet, creating was a way of living.  I remember spending hours telling stories online, whether it be through drawing fanart or roleplaying fantasies. It got to the point when my mother enforced a limit, worried that I was getting addicted to the computer. Now, I've found myself being gifted various opportunities (e.g. a prestigious scholarship, international freelance gigs, exciting Web3 projects) thanks to being well-versed in design, art, and writing: these are skills that I primarily gained not through sitting in school, but through having fun online.\n\nAround me, I see kids growing up the same way. At one end, there are developers learning programming through creation games like Roblox and Minecraft. At another, there are artists cultivating their craft in fandom communities on Twitter and Discord. I believe that these kids aren't just making their own futures, but the world's as well; investor Chris Dixon says that these [present-day hobbies will seed future industries](https://cdixon.org/2013/03/02/what-the-smartest-people-do-on-the-weekend-is-what-everyone-else-will-do-during-the-week-in-ten-years). Today's youth will be tomorrow's innovators.\n\nSo why aren't these hobbies taken seriously? It's because schools are still seen as the main venue of a person's development. However, there's more to learning than what can be found in school. In this essay, I'll be talking about how schools block students' growth, how existing online spaces make up for this, and how a giant game could become the best classroom for all of us.\n\n\n### Schools, spaces, and how students do in them\n\n#### How schools fail us\nOur educational institutions are designed to benefit the system, not the student.  They are influenced by what sociologist George Ritzer calls [\"McDonaldization\"](https://www.cpp.edu/~ddwills/courses/ant352/readings352/McDonaldization.htm), where principles of the fast food industry, driven by ‚Äúrationality,‚Äù dominate other sectors of society. It is expressed through four characteristics: efficiency, calculability, predictability, and control. Efficiency is seen in grouping students by age and replacing teachers with online lessons. Calculability is seen in ridiculous class sizes and high stakes testing. Predictability is seen in standardized curriculums and overreliance on lecture slides. Control is seen in automatic grading and using fear as incentive. \n\nTo summarize, here's a statement from [educator Shelley Wright](https://shelleywright.wordpress.com/2014/08/16/the-mcdonaldization-of-education-the-rise-of-slow/): \"McDonaldization attempts to wipe out any of the messiness or inefficiencies of learning. Instead, it attempts to reduce it to a commodity that can be packaged, marketed and sold. Rather than¬†cultivating a deep, holistic love of learning that touches every aspect of a student‚Äôs life, learning has been reduced to an assembly line. In reality, we‚Äôve imposed a mechanistic view of life onto how people learn, which is largely an organic process, and at a great cost.\"\n\n#### Virtual spaces: what they give and take\nSo how do virtual spaces ‚Äî like video games and online communities ‚Äî serve them? In [\"Video Games are the Future of Education\"](https://nabeelqu.co/education), Nabeel Qureshi gives multiple conclusions. \n\nOne, they give students the environment and tools to make discoveries themselves. This is because they provide space, time, and autonomy, which enables students to *choose* what they learn and how they learn it. Schools cannot provide this level of freedom. That's why kids remember what they encounter through engaging in these spaces, and forget what is taught to them in classes. They need to feel like it's just *play*.\n\nTwo, these spaces provide deep understanding of subjects. This is because they simulate reality and provide fast feedback loops, thanks to innovative features like immersive  environments and real-time communication. Outputs are tangible to students, and directly related to the skills they learn (e.g. Git repositories to code, published pieces to art); this applies to the response their works get as well (e.g. comments, metrics). Compare this to the typical school experience, which is quite shallow; when you're focused on memorizing information just to pass exams, you don't have the capacity to dive deep into a topic.\n\nIn short, virtual spaces are optimal learning environments because they provide additional context and creative freedom. Aside from this, they bring together people with diverse ideas and interests since there are no barriers of physical location. This allows for a more equitable and effective distribution of knowledge, skills, and information. All of this is empowering for students. However, these spaces are still capable of exploiting or underserving the youth, just like in traditional education. \n\nOne, real life inequality is elevated due to the digital divide. Those who can't rely on their own devices or connectivity won't be able to benefit from these spaces as much as people who can. Even worse, these spaces can also bar people financially. [In many MMO games, the premium experience (i.e. exclusive items, more user privileges) is reserved for those who can afford a membership](https://nancyzuo.substack.com/p/capitalism-in-virtual-worlds?r=8kghs\u0026utm_campaign=post\u0026utm_medium=web\u0026utm_source=). Free members can't get these unless they work for it (a.k.a. putting in more time for less pay). \n\nTwo, most creators don't get to benefit from their work, since majority of profit goes to the platforms. For example: [it is challenging for game developers to make money on Roblox, and the platform profits from people trying](https://www.wired.com/story/on-roblox-kids-learn-its-hard-to-earn-money-making-games/).  Developers only get a 25 percent cut of revenue, which is one third of the industry standard. If they want to take out their earnings, they must have a premium subscription ($5 a month) and earn a minimum of 100,000 Robux. This disincentivizes them from withdrawing. \n\nOverall, these conditions make it difficult for youth to get value not just from these spaces, but from the work they produce in them. It's why many parents/guardians aren't accepting of their kids' spending so much time online; they see it as a waste of time and money, and are unable to see how it could be beneficial long-term. Imagine how much creators would be enabled if these barriers to participation were removed.  How can we tackle these problems? It's time to get abstract.\n\n### Changing the game\nTo recap: I believe that the youth learn best when they feel like they're engaging in play; after all, we humans are [Homo Ludens](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/233221.Homo_Ludens) ‚Äî born players. But I don't necessarily just mean playing video games. I'm talking about the games we play in life.\n\nAccording to [James Carse](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/189989.Finite_and_Infinite_Games), there are two types of games: finite, which is played for the purpose of winning, and infinite, which is played for the purpose of continuing play. In our current society, most of us are playing finite games. Online, people aim for getting to the top of the leaderboards, or increasing reach: X amount of followers, likes, shares, etc. Offline, people desire to score the highest salary, or acquiring that prestigious degree.  Our existing educational environments encourage this way of thinking: not just schools, but also the online platforms we occupy (e.g. social media). This zero-sum mentality is not healthy to have long-term, especially for creators. No matter what or how much you make, it would never be enough. It's a recipe for burnout. \n\nWhat if we approached life as an infinite game? Success doesn't have to be stressful; in fact, [the pursuit of excellence can be a positive-sum game, with no finish line and no losers](https://www.weareworldquant.com/en/thought-leadership/playing-the-infinite-game/). According to writer [Kevin Kelly](https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Finite_vs._Infinite_Games), evolution, life, the mind, and the technium (the accumulation of all inventions that humans have ever created) are infinite games. The things in life we love most can be played the same way. How to start: instead of playing within boundaries, play with them. Technologist May-Li Khoe advises: \"...instead of thinking of life as a series of checks, see it as a canvas which you can paint anyway you like. the status quo needs to change, and life is short. Thus, we need to [joyfully subvert the status quo](https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-1/joyful-subversion/).\"\n\nWhat attracted me to MMORPG games and art communities were the values they encouraged: creation and collaboration. All people wanted to do was to keep making things and sharing them with others.  This wholesome culture changed with the [advent of platforms](https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-rise-fall-internet-art-communities); now, interactions are quantifiable and people are motivated by competition. If we want to make learning feel like play, we need to revive the culture of the early web, so that engaging online feels like an infinite game once again. And I believe that the key to this shift lies in making a whole new web.\n\n### A Whole New Web\nThe Internet is already the venue for the biggest infinite game ever;  investor Packy McCormick calls this the Great Online Game. Here, you play as yourself, and can rack up points, skills, and attributes that can be applied to your online and offline lives. If you continuously provide value without expecting anything in return, you will be rewarded well. This is best seen in social media, where you can make new friends, join exciting projects, and gain unimaginable wealth all just from sharing valuable ideas. Founders, influencers, technologists, and creatives have all found success by playing this game. The best part is that anyone can play this game; it's free to play, and levelling up is easier since your financial and social capital isn't tied tightly to real life credentials and connections.\n\nHow is this connected to learning? Playing the Great Online Game is the ultimate learning experience. Thanks to the Internet, we're now entering an age of [embedded education](https://fakepixels.substack.com/p/fkpxls-special-volume-embedded-education), where learning happens everywhere instead of being limited to individual platforms. This means that people learn through encounters they have in systems that may exist for non-educational purposes. For example, see communities centered around SaaS products like Figma and Notion; people teach others how to make the most out of products through shared resources and instructive tutorials.\n\nHowever, the current state of the web isn't designed for the new ways we're playing and learning. This will change; in the future, I believe that embedded education will take on the form of a Metaverse powered by Web3. Here, participants play an (infinite) game that rewards learning by *doing*. This meta-game would be composed of multiple sub-games, where learning takes many forms: going to events (e.g. lectures, workshops, panels), creating insightful content, taking on job experiences, and working on side projects. Thus, everyone is a lifelong student; why would you want to stop learning when there's so much opportunities for it?¬†\n\nBefore we can further illustrate this vision, we must first understand the underlying technologies. Why take the form of a Metaverse? What is Web3 anyways, and what does it even mean to be powered by it? To understand this, we need to start with Web1 and Web2. \n\n#### Web3\nWeb1 is all about consumption. Since the web was still in its early stages of development, most Internet users were readers of static web pages. It was difficult to produce your own web pages since it required both technical literacy and available time. Creativity was still alive though; because of technical constraints, [everything was *handmade*](https://stackingthebricks.com/how-blogs-broke-the-web/), from website navigation to image placement. No two home pages looked the same. \n\nThis changed with the arrival of Web2, which is all about creation. The invention of platforms (i.e. blogging and social media) made it easier to create content; now, anyone can be both consumer and creator. However, it can be argued that some creative power was sacrificed. One, individuality declined. Due to efficiency, users were working *inside* systems instead of *building* their own. Two, content is owned by companies operating platforms, not the users who generated all of it. This is the price they pay for using these platforms, along with their personal data. \n\nThankfully, Web3 is all about ownership. It's a new version of the Internet where [interactions in applications/software are facilitated through wallets ‚Äî which serve as both verified identities and funding sources](https://twitter.com/gaby_goldberg/status/1449002871706501133).  This mechanic decentralizes the web, empowering users to own their content, data, and assets. \n\nWallets mainly handle cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum; these serve as in-game money for the Great Online Game, rewarding participation. You can gain tokens from supporting your favorite projects/people early (link to ENS airdrop?), along with exchanging value directly (e.g. crowdfunding an essay in ETH). You can also get rewarded for learning with the Learn to Earn (L2E) model, which pays people for performing tasks and learning skills.\n(Web3, Crypto, and Learning post). For example: on Rabbithole, you can earn crypto by learning about Web3. \n\nAnother type of token that can be earned is a Non-Fungible Token (NFT): cryptographic tokens that prove authenticity, ownership, and scarcity of digital assets. NFTs can be applied to any type of digital media: visuals, text, and audio. Right now, they're best known for being digital artworks, but they have so many use cases: event tickets, advertisements, domains and more. Imagine what they could do for learning!\n\nOverall, Web3 brings the Internet closer to people than ever before. Interactions feel more concrete because digital assets now have physical characteristics; cryptocurrencies act like cash, and NFTs act like real life items. However, due to its complexity, Web3 is in need of an interface that can bring it to its fullest potential. Enter the Metaverse.\n\n\n#### The Metaverse\nThe Metaverse can be generally defined as an Internet that brings a sense of place and facilitates rich human connection. We are already living in the early stages of the Metaverse. Encouraged by the pandemic, most of our lives have shifted online: working, talking, shopping, and more; our physical spaces have been replaced by [spatial software](https://darkblueheaven.com/spatialsoftware/) such as games like Fortnite and platforms like Gather. However, our digital experience is currently scattered across various spaces, making us feel disconnected. Web3 can be the framework that weaves these together into one big cohesive universe. As the ultimate virtual space, the ideal Metaverse would be the perfect environment for embedding education. \n\nThis Metaverse would also be the ultimate digital creative tool. In [\"Computers and Creativity\"](https://www.mollymielke.com/cc), designer Molly Mielke discusses how digital creative tools can potentially be co-creators with human beings; they foster innovation by lowering the barrier to entry, making all users toolmakers and owners. In order to do this, the tools need to be interoperable, moldable, efficient, and community-driven: all traits that an ideal Metaverse has. Here's how the Metaverse can be developed to its fullest potential, especially for education.\n\n##### Standardization\nOur online experience is scattered because the current state of the Internet is siloed. Since it's under the control of a few Big Tech companies, the websites users interact with lack connections with one another. This forces users to make several accounts since activities are restricted to single platforms only; for example, this can be seen in the need for multiple social media accounts. Confining one's activity to the platform it was done on hinders collaboration and limits creativity.\n\nA Web3-powered Metaverse is built for interopability. What this means is that users aren't restricted to a single platform. Thanks to  wallets, everyone has their own inventory (John Palmer); they can bring their data, content, and assets with them wherever they go. Being able to move these into different platforms increases their value, and allows for more collaboration and innovation between people. However, interoperability is only possible through standardization, which ensures compatibility. A great example of this is the open-source movement. Extensive documentation and open liceensing enables a remixing culture where developers are always building upon each other's creations. Even large Big Tech companies have benefitted from this, since their products are built with the help of open-source code.\n\nStandardization can also be seen in Web3, whose first target audience was developers. For example, the ERC-20 token standard is used for outlining specifications that ensure that tokens function optimally on the Ethereum blockchain (e.g. the total supply, how to transfer tokens, and how transactions are approved). Over 1,000 assets follow this standard, making it one of the core pillars of the blockchain ecosystem (Gemini cryptopedia). The same is being done for the Metaverse. Big Tech companies are sharing their outputs to help grow the ecosystem (e.g. Pixar open sourced the Universal Scene Description file format to help developers create interchangeable 3D data) (Matthew Ball - Interchange, Tools, and Standards). The Open Metaverse Interopability Group is also designing and promoting protocols for integral features like identity, social graphs, inventory, etc.\n\nTo summarize, Mielke writes that standardization would fundamentally improve digital creative tools by \"...allowing in more collaborators, making space for greater tooling innovation, and expanding a project's creative constraints beyond any one tool itself.\" A Web3-powered Metaverse cannot be built alone; standardization brings both the giant manpower and diverse perspectives needed to bring it to life. Here are some ideas of what standardization can do for an educational metaverse:\n+ Every player has their own profile. This acts as a dynamic resume, where everything you learn and make is automatically shown on-chain. This also acts as a passport, showing your online travels: consuming, curating, publishing, and investing. \n+ Everytime you go to an educational experience, you get a badge that is included in your profile. This is made possible through Proof of Attendance Protocols (POAPs), NFTs that serve as reliable records of life experiences. \n+ Tokens will be used as incentives for learning. Token holders can exchange their tokens for fiat, compensating students/teachers/creators, and for making decisions regarding how the group behind the experience operates.\n+ Educational materials (i.e. syllabi, playbooks, journals) will be open-sourced. The culture of remixing will persist; these materials will always be open to edits, comments, and updates from the general public. \n+ In order to tackle problems of information overload and quality control, curators for these materials will be needed more than ever. Profiles will be used to determine if a person has enough experience to become a curator for a certain topic.\n\n##### Moldability\nNowadays, in an era of mass-produced software, the way we use most digital tools are dictated by the companies who created them. However, everyone is unique in their thought process. If the tools we use are extensions of ourselves, being forced to adapt to the tool being used is limiting. Ideally, the tools we hse should fit our workflows, and not the other way around (Linus Lee). Thus, the ability for users to tailor their tools to their needs is key for supporting creativity.\n\nOwnership in Web3 enables people's creativity. Just like with video games, people customize their digital presence through the things they acquire: profile pictures, virtual clothing, ENS domains, and more. The Metaverse gives these digital assets physical characteristics, making them feel more real for people. A virtual land can be a 3D canvas that holds infinite possibilities; it can be an art gallery (Cyber), a theme park (The Sandbox), a shopping district (Republic Realm)...anything you want it to be. Overall, a Web3-powered Metaverse is not just a digital creative tool -- it is powerful enough to be a medium for creative expression.\n\nAnd self-expression is the path to levelling up online. McCormick writes: \"... the more you signal who you are and what you care about, the more you open yourself up to new possibilties.\" (The Great Online Game) These new possibilities are opportunities (e.g. partnerships, offers, projects) that come because people are attracted to your presence.\n\nThe success of digital tools can also be attributed to passionate communities behind them. Web3 and the Metaverse are already cool technologies on their own, but they're brought to life through the people using them. For instance, see (toolmakers): pioneering users that share their creations and advocate for a tool's promise; they're vital for empowering average users, since the toolmakers' creations inspire average users to mold the tool themselves. Content creators and community builders are good examples of this.\n\nWeb3 has especially grown because of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs): mission-driven groups that coordinate through blockchain-enforced rules (Linda Xie). They serve as core infrastructure for the (Great Online Game) by making it easier to connect and collaborate with others online; these same processes would take even longer offline. The tools they use are also made for moldability. Outside of Web3 apps, the tools they prefer the most are the ones that are most customizable, like Discord and Notion. Since DAOs are distributed remotely, many use Metaverse platforms like Gather for cultivating connections. Communities like DAOs that help these tools further innovate themselves.\n\nTo summarize, tools like a Web3-powered Metaverse can facilitate creativity by allowing customization and being supported by a collaborative community. Here are some ideas of what moldability can do for an educational metaverse:\n+ The overall experience for players should feel like a Choose Your Own Adventure. Players customize their character by choosing what they want to acquire, from learned skills to supported works. This may lead to the emergence of different classes; the profile of an artist will look different from a community builder.\n+ Teachers will become designers. The learning experience they'll be designing will involve not just content and delivery, but also  environment (where are students learning?) and mechanics (what systems/rules do they have to follow?). \n+ Classrooms as we know them today will be greatly transformed in order to fit a variety of learning styles. (Link to Azlen Ezla designs) \n+ Depending on the teacher, tokens can represent almost anything that can be tracked with a smart contract: reputation on a social platform, skills of a video game character, etc.\n+ Learning DAOs will be the new schools. Plug KERNEL by Gitcoin, Crypto Culture Society, and Ethernaut DAO\n+ DAOs can also act like guilds, onboarding students and helping them level up in this game. There's a niche for every type of person: artists, developers, gamers, investors, etc.\n\n##### Abstraction\nThaks to Web2 consumer platforms, it's easier for everyone to create and share content online. However, when it comes to technical disciplines like programming, the creative process is still complex. The abstract nature of code forces developers to play computer in their head, spending more energy on visualizing the problem instead of working on it themselves (The Coming Software Apocalypse). This barrier is what prevents people from learning technical skills -- which are key if one wishes to mold their own part of the Internet. \n\nIn order for people to make use of a tool's moldability, it must be abstracted enough to be accessible. This usually means that its interface must be controlled visually (WYSIWYG) and require no technical knowledge. Thankfully, canvas-based creative tools like interface design software and no-code builders have made it easier to create on the web. Abstraction can also help improve inefficient parts of the creative process. An efficient tool minimizes repetitive work, allowing users to focus on being creative; this is done by simplifying repetitive workflows and accomodating logic.\n\nWeb3 enables creativity by making collaborating or coordinating with others much more efficient. This is done through smart contracts, self-executing contracts that have their terms written in code (Investopedia). DAOs are powered by such contracts, which define the group's rules and hold their treasury; this reduces possibility of conflict that may obstruct the DAO's desired outcomes. Offering predefined elements is another way to simplify repetitive workflows. In Web3, this is done through composability: the ability of system components to connect to each other, just like Lego pieces (Aragon). The open-source nature of most Web3 projects helps reduce set-up time for other builders, which increases the rate of experimentation and innovation.\n\nHowever, Web3 is still too complex and confusing for most users. In order to achieve mass adoption, it will need a paradigm-shifting interface. McCormick writes that it will need to (The Interface Phase) \"...add order to the...chaos of decentralization, and give obvious and meaningful utility to digital assets...it will need to...hide complexity beneath the surface, and deliver clean experiences. It will need to create a canvas for both developers and users themselves to create the next million new apps.\"\n\nAs an interface, the Metaverse will be able to do all of this. Its visual nature will reduce friction in Web3 user experience by making abstract concepts feel more concrete. The Metaverse is also an efficient tool itself since [it's considered as infrastructure](https://venturebeat.com/2021/11/18/the-metaverse-is-infrastructure/), making actions like communicating real-time, managing presence, and earning money easier. For sure, creation will become easier as well; the beginnings of this are already being seen in video games.\n\nTo summarize, abstraction makes tools fully responsible for executing tedious tasks, which allows people to fully focus on the act of creation. If the Metaverse gives form to Web3, more people will be enabled to make use of this powerful technology. This would help them gain ownership over the web in their own ways. Here are some ideas of what abstraction can do for an educational metaverse:\n+ Being online should feel as natural as real life. Imagine an immersive 3D world where 2D interfaces are seamlessly integrated. My pegs for this are Google Glass (clean, responsive, and practical HUD interface design) and Somnium Space (blockchain-based multiverse designed for virtual reality).\n+ No matter what you aim to create, there will be a template for it. This will come from all the open-source works created by others. For example, the Metaverse can come with starting environments for classrooms, social mixers, conferences, etc.\n+ The data your profile contains can provide suggestions for your learning journey. You can get recommended skills you could learn, quests/experiences you could take on, people you would vibe with, etc.\n+ Learning will primarily be done through a hands-on approach. Khan Academy already teaches programming like this; in exercises, the left-hand side contains the code while the right-hand side contains the simulation of it. How can this be applied to other subjects? Imagine taking tours back in time for history, governing hypothetical countries for politics, and more.\n\n\nOverall, the Metaverse makes creating easier for all, which in turn aids the process of learning. Stated well by [investor Tina He](https://fakepixels.substack.com/p/fkpxls-special-volume-embedded-education): \"If the purpose of education is to inspire courage to expand our collective understanding of the world, the vision of Embedded Education is that every time we see something that inspires us, the path to actualizing this new-found dream starts right where we find it.\" Hopefully, this ease motivates people to learn not because they want to win something, but instead because they truly enjoy it.\n\n### We're ready for this future\nThe youth are already primed for this future; being immersed in digital worlds helps us transition to virtual systems like Web3. Founder Brian Cho discusses the youth's advantages. \n\n#### (Value) creation/contribution\nConcepts like wallets, tokens, and NFTs are intuitive for the youth to understand because of a childhood spent dealing with virtual currencies and goods. They are also already used to working for rewards online, whether it be through grinding for XP or commenting for reputation. This applies to learning too; they are willing to put up with a steep learning curve  just to have fun. \n\n#### Community\nMany youths were active participants of gaming guilds and fan forums, so the way DAOs operate is natural for them. For example, take community-led governance. Kids who run Minecraft servers are always thinking about the impact the design of their server has on their players (e.g. making their world free-for-all, punishing those who break the rules, using plugins to prevent damage). At the same time, they're also learning about soft skills like compromising with others, balancing demands and resolving conflict.\n \n#### Culture\nJust like in our current Internet, web3 identities revolve around merit; what you do online is more important than who you are offline. Thus, being anonymous/psuedonymous is not off-putting at all. The way people communicate is affected too. Web2 memes and language (e.g. gamer lingo like gg, ggwp, glhf) has been a huge influence on Web3 memes and language (e.g. gm, gn, wagmi). All of this helps cultivate a sense of connection with strangers all across the globe.\n\n### How can we create it?\n#### Public good\nIf we want learning in the future to be an infinite game, we must ensure that this Metaverse will be a public good. This means it must have the following characteristics. One, it has to be non-rivalrous, which means that it's accessible to everyone; a person's use of the good does not impact its availability to others. Two, it has to be non-excludable, which means that it should be impossible to exclude anybody from using the good.\n\nOur current education system does not fulfill these criteria. Both traditional schools and alternative learning experiences (i.e. fellowships and bootcamps) are inherently rivalrous because the amount of students is inversely correlated with the quality of interactions. Factors like cost, time, and literacy can also exclude others from getting educated.\n\nAn open Metaverse would make education more accessible. Video games like Minecraft and Fortnite have served as engaging educational platforms, teaching thousands of kids all over the world; imagine all the possibilities if these games worked together. However, if companies like Meta are allowed to take control of this space, the Metaverse will become closed. The extractive systems of web2 that value profits over people would be revived -- hurting young creators all over again. (Rabbithole thread)\n\n#### Game design\nThis Metaverse must also be intentionally designed, just like games too. However, we must be wary of gamification; it usually becomes pointsification, which is all about external motivation. Examples of this are mechanics like points, badges, and leaderboards: signifiers of finite games. Educator Ana Lorena Fabrega says that games are at their best when people play them out of genuine interest. Same should apply to this Metaverse; people should be playing not because they want to be rewarded, but because they simply enjoy it. In order to design a game like this, Fabrega states the need for the following criteria. \n\nFirst, **a goal/specific outcome that provides players with a sense of purpose.** The overarching goal for this Metaverse would be providing value; whatever you learn should be used to help other people learn too. This goal could be interpreted in various ways by DAOs, which could write their own manifestos. What would a Sustainable Development Goals look like in this new digital realm?\n\nNext, **rules that place limitations on how players can achieve their goal.** Examples of rules could be game mechanics and Codes of Conduct. These ensure that players have an enjoyable experience. Without rules, players may be confused on what to do, take shortcuts that defeat the game's purpose, or offend fellow players.\n\nThen, **a feedback system that tells players how close they are to achieving their goal.** Feedback is mainly sourced from fellow players. From an audience's responses, one is able to tell from their  actions what's working and what's not. They must also be careful of favoring quantifiable metrics; views and likes may not compare to genuine conversations.\n\nFinally, **voluntary participation.** It's not a game if people don't know that they're playing. Consent isn't just agreeing to play, but also having full knowledge of the game. This can be done through web3 wallet transactions, which must always be signed before being processed. The problem is conveying all necessary information (i.e. objectives, rules) clearly without becoming an typical Terms and Conditions.\n\nI see these criteria being applied to both the sub-games that serve as learning opportunities (e.g. joining hackathons) and the meta-game itself a.k.a. the Metaverse. \n\n#### Challenges\nThe main problem barring the creation of this Metaverse concerns technology: the Internet's current infrastructure is not developed enough to support this grand vision. Both Web3 and Metaverse (i.e. AR, XR, VR) technologies are still in their early stages, so only a privileged few can benefit from using them. But before the Metaverse can be introduced to all, there are big social and economic challenges that need to be tackled. \n\nOne, personal privacy. Do we really want to make everything we learn and make visible on the blockchain? Both \"successes\" and \"failures\" would be shown (i.e. mastering the Solidity language v.s. initiating an unprofitable NFT project). How can we encourage failure and growth without it being detrimental to one's prospects? If we aren't careful, this may lead to a personal branding similar to Linkedin culture, only where people are afraid of getting involved with projects that may hurt their resume.\n\nTwo, marketplace competition. In the perspective of most companies (especially Big Tech), it's more beneficial to create their own walled gardens versus collaborating with others. This is what leads them to build proprietary products from open source software and steal features from one another (e.g. Snapchat's stories). How can we incentivize working together in order to build an interopable Metaverse? I find hope in the culture of Web3, where collaboration is the norm; there are always projects seeking collaborators and DAOs open for partnerships.\n\nThree, misinformation. Many people are skeptical or against Web3 due to concerns like hyperfinancialization and environmental impact. It doesn't help that the language of Web3 isn't beginner-friendly, or that the space is filled with scammers. We must tackle these concerns so that more people (not just the highly privileged) can feel ready enough to become participants. \n\n#### Conclusion\nThe ways we're learning and creating are no longer serving us; both traditional schools and Web2 platforms take more value from people instead of giving it to them. A better future lies in game-like technologies like Web3 and the Metaverse, which the youth caught on to first because of a childhood spent immersed in virtual spaces. These same youth will be the innovators who'll be making this future a reality.\n\nHowever, this is only possible because virtual spaces (i.e. games, communities) were open to these youth, being both accessible and engaging. We need to ensure that a Web3-powered Metaverse will be the same. If it's closed off to all but a select few, we'd be closing off potential creators who hold new possibilities for human innovation.\n\nIf life is a game, we all want to level up. We choose the type of game we want to play. Do you want to upgrade only yourself, or also help upgrade our world? Your success is up to you.\n\n## Draft 2\n### A Whole New Web\n#### Welcome to the Metaverse\n- we are now living in a metaverse paragraph\n- back with web3? (no need to describe in detail; can be expounded in later sections)\n- the ultimate digital creative tool\n\nhttps://ed3.mirror.xyz/0U3QG8-4K6CD_ltU6SJyKN3-uBD3x6nEFs-YeShzYmk\ngood intro to ed3\n\u003e **Web3 refers to the decentralized ecosystem of technology to support the next generation of virtual engagement.**\n\n\u003e **Web3 enables individual users to make decisions about their online activity without having to compromise utility**.\n\n\u003e **In ed3, learners own their education - validating their knowledge with decentralized technology in contrast to previous models.**\n\n\u003e -   Ed1 was knowledge transfer provided by accredited institutions, such as universities and high schools\n\u003e - Ed2 was centralized platforms distributing education, such as Udemy, Skillshare, and Outschool\n\u003e - Ed3 is individuals gathering skills from a variety of sources and validating that knowledge in their own wallet.\n\n#### Standardization\nWhat if...**[every player could have their own profile?](https://www.rushil2cents.com/the-internet-as-your-resume/)** Right now, we have multiple social media accounts because the applications we use aren't connected to one another; this confines one's activity to the platform it was done on. A Web3-powered Metaverse is built for interoperability, freeing users from being restricted to platforms. Thanks to¬†wallets, [everyone can have their own inventory](https://darkblueheaven.com/newinternetlogic), enabling them to bring their data, content, and assets with them wherever they go. These inventories are the basis of profiles. They can act as dynamic resumes/passports, where everything you learn and make is automatically shown on-chain. \n\nFor instance, you could get a badge for every educational experience you've attended. This is made possible through [Proof of Attendance Protocols (POAPs)](https://poap.xyz/), NFTs that serve as reliable records of life experiences. Experiments like [Free Learn](https://kernel.community/en/blog/community/free-learn/) and [LABEL](https://beincrypto.com/learn/label-blockchain-mooc/) have been exploring this. Imagine also earning tokens for learning. As a token holder, you'd be able to exchange your tokens for fiat, compensate students/teachers/creators, and make decisions regarding how the group behind the experience operates. For instance, learners in [Crypto, Culture, \u0026 Society](https://ccsdao.xyz) (liberal arts education for crypto) use their tokens for voting on the syllabus, scholarships, guests, etc.\n\nWhat if...**we could co-create our classrooms?** Interoperability is only possible through standardization, which ensures compatibility. The open-source movement does this well; extensive documentation and open licensing enables a remixing culture where developers are always building upon each other's creations. Standards are already being created for our potential learning environment. For example, over 1,000 assets in the Ethereum ecosystem follow the ERC-20 token standard; meanwhile, the Metaverse ecosystem is being built by both Big Tech companies and volunteer groups (e.g. [Pixar open sourcing the Universal Scene Description file format](https://www.matthewball.vc/all/interchangemetaverse); [The Open Metaverse Interoperability Group](https://omigroup.org/home/) designing protocols for integral features like identity, social graphs, inventory, etc.).\n\nImagine also collaboratively creating our curricula. Educational materials (i.e. syllabi, playbooks, journals) would be open-sourced. The culture of remixing will still persist; these materials will always be open to edits, comments, and updates from the general public. In order to tackle problems of information overload and quality control, curators for these materials will be needed more than ever. Profiles can be used to determine if a person has enough experience to become a curator for a certain topic.\n\nTo summarize, Mielke writes that standardization would fundamentally improve digital creative tools by [\"...allowing in more collaborators, making space for greater tooling innovation, and expanding a project's creative constraints beyond any one tool itself.\"](https://www.mollymielke.com/cc#stan) A Web3-powered Metaverse cannot be built alone; standardization brings both the giant manpower and diverse perspectives needed to bring it to life.\n\n#### Moldability\nWhat if...**learning was like a Choose Your Own Adventure?** Players could customize their character by choosing what they want to acquire, from learned skills to supported works. This may lead to the emergence of different classes; the profile of an artist will look different from a community builder. Self-expression is the path to levelling up online; McCormick writes: [\"... the more you signal who you are and what you care about, the more you open yourself up to new possibilities.\"](https://www.notboring.co/p/the-great-online-game)  These new possibilities are opportunities (e.g. partnerships, offers, projects) that come because people are attracted to your presence.\n\nIf we could design our own profiles, what if **we could also design our learning experience?** Nowadays, in an era of mass-produced software, our workflows are dictated by the tools we use. However, everyone is unique in their thought process. A Web3-powered Metaverse acknowledges this by enabling us [to own the ways we learn and create.](https://thesephist.com/posts/tools/) We're already used to customizing our digital presence, whether it's through the profile pictures we use or the personal websites we make. So why can't we have this for our digital experiences as well? \n\nIt's difficult to learn how to fully customize our experiences without being exposed to how others mold them. Enter [toolmakers](https://www.mollymielke.com/cc#mold): pioneering users that share their creations and advocate for a tool's promise. They're vital for empowering average users, since the toolmakers' creations inspire average users to mold the tool themselves. Content creators and community builders are good examples of this; in their own way, they're also teachers, bringing the best out of their audiences.\n\nThus, the teachers of the future will be full-fledged designers. They'll be designing not just content and delivery, but also¬†environment (where are students learning?) and mechanics (what systems/rules do they have to follow?). In the Metaverse, the forms a classroom can take are endless: [an art gallery](https://oncyber.io/), [a theme park](https://www.animocabrands.com/the-sandbox-partners-with-atari), [a shopping district](https://www.republicrealm.com/metajuku)...anything you want it to be. With more people from diverse backgrounds becoming teachers, classrooms will be greatly transformed in order to fit a variety of learning styles. See [Azlen Elza's classroom design explorations.](https://twitter.com/azlenelza/status/1457346877163143170) Teachers could also incorporate tokens into the learning experience; these can track almost anything that can be tracked with a smart contract (e.g. reputation on a social platform, skills of a video game character). Imagine all the possible ways learning could happen.\n\nWhat if...**learning was like a multiplayer game?** As seen with toolmakers, passionate communities are vital to the learning experiences of game \u0026 SaaS platforms; imagine Minecraft without its creative builders or Notion without its productivity nerds. Navigating your own education is difficult without having guides and peers supporting you. In a Web3-powered Metaverse, communities would come in the form of DAOs, or decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs): mission-driven groups that coordinate through blockchain-enforced rules (Linda Xie). [This structure enables learners and educators alike to collaboratively steward their education](https://twitter.com/KatwellKat/status/1490428103612518400).\n\nDAOs could act as guilds, onboarding newbies and helping them level up in this game. A niche exists for every type of person: artists, developers, gamers, investors, etc., and students could choose what best suits their adventure. Membership is signified with an NFT on their profile, which in turn gives them access to the guild's content and community. Students grow by acquiring experience points and tokens through completing learning bounties or sharing knowledge with others.\n\nOverall, a Web3-powered Metaverse is not just a digital creative tool -- it is powerful enough to be a *medium* for creative expression. This is because of customization and the support of collaborative communities. This educational platform cannot serve everyone if it cannot adapt to anyone's needs.\n#### Abstraction\nWhat if...**learning was truly hands-on?** In order to enable more people's creativity online, the technical work required of them must be abstracted. Enaging with technology is still too complex and confusing because it still requires a ton of cognitive effort, whether you're an everyday user or an experienced developer. This can be seen in learning Web3, where transactions must be understood before being approved, and programming, where [the problem must be visualized before working on it.](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/09/saving-the-world-from-code/540393/) As the most immersive learning environment, a Web3-powered Metaverse would take on the burden of comprehension by making abstract concepts feel more concrete, leaving learners to focus on critical thinking. At the same time, it would encourage them to have fun, making the steep learning curve less excruciating. \n\nThis is why games are the new classrooms. For instance, see \"programming by demonstration\". Khan Academy already teaches like this; in their exercises, the left-hand side contains the code while the right-hand side contains the simulation of it. The Metaverse would upgrade this simulation, turning outputs on a screen to a whole world you can interact with, like Minecraft. [It encourages computational thinking in kids through their advanced elements, like redstone and command blocks.](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/17/magazine/the-minecraft-generation.html) This can also be done for investing in crypto and NFTs. Why read instructional modules when you can experience trading instead? You can do this in [Curious Addy's Trading Club](https://www.curiousaddys.com/), where players can simulate trading cryptocurrencies and NFTs risk-free. Imagine learning other subjects through games too!\n\nWhat if...**you didn't have to start from scratch?** Abstraction also improves inefficient parts of the creative process by simplifying repetitive workflows and accommodating logic. Offering predefined elements is one way to increase efficiency. This is done in Web3 through [composability](https://blog.aragon.org/what-is-composability/): the ability of system components to connect to each other, just like Lego pieces; the open-source nature of most projects helps reduce set-up time for other builders, increasing the rate of experimentation and innovation.\n\nWhen put together, building blocks form foundational structures. A Web3-powered Metaverse serves as an [infrastructure](https://venturebeat.com/2021/11/18/the-metaverse-is-infrastructure/), making learning and creating more efficient. Here, teachers could find a template for any learning  experience they want to create; imagine starting environments for classrooms, social mixers, conferences, etc. These would come from open-source works provided by other creators. This also applies to designing your own learning journey. The data your profile contains can recommend skills you could learn, quests/experiences you could take on, people you would vibe with, etc.\n\nAside from learning and creating, the application process must also be improved; this is currently broken for both schools and workplaces, which are places for learning. Profiles, interviews, and references aren't indicative of one's performance; they also take a lot of effort, whether you're the applicant or the evaluator. One startup tackling this problem is [Station](https://station.express/), which describes itself as building \"on-chain infrastructure for onboarding \u0026 coordinating contributors of the future.\"  DAOs have their own terminals, which feature all their initiatives; each initiative has information on required commitment, reward(s) for contribution, recommended skills, etc. After someone applies to an initiative, they can get endorsed by existing contributors. \n\nTo summarize, abstraction makes tools fully responsible for executing tedious tasks, which allows people to fully focus on learning and creating. If the Metaverse gives form to Web3, more people will be enabled to make use of this powerful technology. This would help them gain ownership over the web in their own ways.\n\n\n-  everyday magic\n\t- good software creates agency through malleable systems, playful environments, fast feedback loops, and data interopability\n\t\t- malleable systems (abstraction?)\n\t\t\t- providing building blocks\n\t\t\t- more approachable than forcing ppl into rigid flows\n\t\t\t- enables moldability\n\t\t- playful environments (moldability?)\n\t\t\t- learning curve is steep, so it must be fun instead of excruciating\n\t\t\t- solve boring utilitarian needs by embedding fun into the core experience, rewarding experimentation and learning through doing.\n\t\t- fast feedback loops (abstractionl)\n\t\t\t- delayd can derail creative desire\n\t\t\t- requirements: responsive to updating on changes and streamlining complexty\n\t\t\t- E.G. no-code\n\t\t- interoperability (standradization)\n\t\t\t- Interoperability refers to the ability to transfer data between apps seamlessly. Practically, this means having easy and comprehensive flows for importing and exporting data into and out of other apps.\n\t\t\t- In a world of fully interoperable software, new apps can have immediate value because individuals can bring data in from existing apps. This immediate access eliminates the moat that incumbent software has over new creations‚Äîmultiplying the effectiveness of individual agency by giving full control over produced data.\n\t- In the context of software, agency comes down to whether someone feels _in control_ and _powerful_ when they‚Äôre using a piece of software, rather than coerced and scared. It‚Äôs the difference between wanting to continue exploring rather than dreading continued use.\n\t- Agency shifts the balance of power‚Äîfrom corporations and startups to everyday communities and neighbors. In the ideal world, individuals would not only have the power to reject agency-deficient and agency-depriving environments, like those with [dark design patterns](https://medium.com/thrive-global/how-technology-hijacks-peoples-minds-from-a-magician-and-google-s-design-ethicist-56d62ef5edf3), misaligned profit models, and pyramid scheme-esque incentives; they will also be responsible for using that power towards a future they want to see.\n\n## Draft 3\n### Environments and how they enable students\nOur learning is often defined by our environment: [the invisible hand that shapes our behavior](https://jamesclear.com/power-of-environment).  In line with this, the best learning environments are **[enabling environments](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z3DaBP4vN1dutjUgrk3jbEeNxScccvDCxDgXe)**; according to researcher Andy Matuschak, these **significantly expand its participants‚Äô capacity to do things they find meaningful and important.** To do this, the activities they provide must directly serve an intrinsically meaningful purpose. When participants are fuelled by an intense personal connection to a subject, they'll naturally partake in effortful engagement, which naturally leads to deep understanding. These activities must also focus on action. Compare reading about a sport versus actually playing the sport; the more isolated participants are from the action, the less likely they are to be enabled by their environment. Overall, an enabling environment enables its participants by creating opportunities for personal growth and highlighting bridges to opportunities for action based on that growth.\n\nSchools aspire to do this, but often fall short; this is because their primary purpose is knowledge/skill development, which isn't intrinsically meaningful on its own. Because of this, students depend on teachers not only for expertise but also for purpose. This dependence hinders the cultivation of an intense personal connection, making it less likely for the students to develop a deep understanding of a subject. Meanwhile, great software environments are better enabling environments for youth because they empower them in pursuing their passions (e.g. expanding range of artistic expression, distributing to millions with zero marginal cost). \n\nMatuschak clarifies that [most games aren't enabling environments](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z6DCZK1JtHU3waXWTk5UbNt3kXU4WRT9EwNND). Even if they're effective at developing knowledge/skills, they rarely expand players' capacity in doing things they find meaningful and important, since the primary purpose of most games is to create an aesthetic/emotional experience. However, there are a few that still count; Minecraft's creative mode enables serious creative expression, while the structured social environments of massively-multiplayer online games enable interpersonal connection and community formation. These types of games, alongside great software environments, are the new schools of today's youth.\n\n\n\n### The Great Online Game\nI believe that the youth learn best when they feel like they're engaging in play; after all, we humans are [Homo Ludens](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/233221.Homo_Ludens) ‚Äî born players. But I don't necessarily just mean playing video games. I'm talking about the games we play in life. According to [writer James Carse](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/189989.Finite_and_Infinite_Games), there are two types of games: finite, which is played for the purpose of winning, and infinite, which is played for the purpose of continuing play. Even if infinite games are best for learning, most of our educational environments are designed as finite games. Offline, we're optimizing for name-brand schools and 4.0 GPAs; online, we're grinding for topping leaderboards and increasing our reach. What if we approached education as an infinite game? \n\nThe Internet already serves as the venue for the biggest infinite game ever: [The Great Online Game](https://www.notboring.co/p/the-great-online-game). Coined by investor Packy McCormick, this is a game where you play as yourself, racking up points, skills, and attributes that can be applied to your online and offline lives. Levelling up here is simple: the more you provide value (without expecting anything in return), the more you'll be rewarded. The best part is that anyone can play this game; it's nearly free to play, and leveling up is easier since your financial and social capital isn't tightly tied to real life credentials and connections. Playing this game is the ultimate way to experience learning by doing.\n\nPeople have always been learning this way, but thanks to the Internet, this approach has been given the spotlight it deserves. We've arrived at an age of [embedded education](https://fakepixels.substack.com/p/fkpxls-special-volume-embedded-education), where learning happens everywhere instead of being limited to individual platforms. Now, people are learning through encounters they have in systems that may have been created for non-educational purposes. On one hand, it looks like teenage girls learning about  [HTML/CSS](https://sea.mashable.com/life/19346/from-tumblr-girl-to-engineer-how-the-platform-inspired-a-generation-of-women-to-code) and [feminism](https://magdalene.co/story/feminism-on-tumblr-third-wave-feminism-in-action) on Tumblr; on the other, it looks like productivity nerds creating resources and tutorials for Notion. \n\nHowever, the current state of the web isn't designed for the new ways we're learning. This must change; in the future, **I believe that the future of education will look like an infinite game that rewards learning by doing.** This meta-game might be composed of multiple sub-games, where learning takes many forms: going to events (e.g. lectures, workshops, panels), creating insightful content, taking on job experiences, and working on side projects. Thus, everyone becomes a lifelong student; why would you want to stop learning when there are so many opportunities for it?\n\n**I believe that a Metaverse powered by Web3 has the potential to bring this vision to life**; however, if we're not careful, it can easily fall into the same traps of modern education. In this essay, I'll be illustrating what this vision looks like, and how we can design this intentionally.\n\n### A Whole New Web\nThis future is defined by freedom; people would be free to choose what they learn and how they learn it. This may only be achievable on an [open web](https://www.yearofopen.org/november-open-perspective-what-is-open-web/what-is-the-open-web-and-why-is-it-important-submitted-by-mark-surman-executive-director-of-the-mozilla-foundation/): one that is by and for all of its users, not select figures or institutions. A closed web is an unequitable world for education; only a few people will have access to opportunities for their personal growth. Together, Web3 and the Metaverse have the potential to open the internet to all.\n\n#### Web3\nAn open internet indicates that everyone gets to have ownership over it, and [Web3](https://eshita.mirror.xyz/H5bNIXATsWUv_QbbEz6lckYcgAa2rhXEPDRkecOlCOI) is the infrastructure that enables this. It's a new vision for the Internet where interactions in applications/software are facilitated through wallets; these replace accounts by [serving as both verified identities and funding sources](https://twitter.com/gaby_goldberg/status/1449002871706501133).¬† This mechanic decentralizes the web, empowering users to own their content, data, and assets. This frees them from being shackled to any given platform (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram). By making platforms obsolete, Web3 disincentivizes the creation of finite games; clout-chasing and wealth-creation no longer seems appealing when it's limited to a single platform. \n\nWeb3 is reshaping education into [Ed3](https://ed3.mirror.xyz/0U3QG8-4K6CD_ltU6SJyKN3-uBD3x6nEFs-YeShzYmk), where learners own their education; instead of relying on accredited institutions and centralized distributors (e.g. universities and Udemy), they get to gather skills from a variety of sources and validate this knowledge in their own wallets. Decentralized technology can help education solve its challenges with access, affordability, and accreditation. Learners will no longer be inhibited by their time, location, and money; the credentials they gain will not just serve as signalling, but actually guarantee competency.\n\nIn short, Web3 empowers people to own their digital identities; this in turn enables them to own their education. However, Web3 is still too complex  and confusing for the typical learner. It can't be navigated without a high degree of technical literacy. In order to make this accessible to all, this infrastructure needs a paradigm-shifting interface. McCormick writes that it needs to [\"...add order to the...chaos of decentralization, and give obvious and meaningful utility to digital assets...it will need to...hide complexity beneath the surface, and deliver clean experiences. It will need to create a canvas for both developers and users themselves to create the next million new apps.\"](https://www.notboring.co/p/the-interface-phase?s=r)Basically: what interface is capable of enabling people to freely navigate Web3? Enter the Metaverse.\n\n\n\n#### Metaverse\nAt the same time, the Metaverse also unlocks the value of Web3. Web3 excels at giving digital assets physical characteristics (e.g. cryptocurrencies behaving like cash, NFTs behaving like physical items); the Metaverse doubles down on this, portraying the internet as a tapestry of rich, immersive environments. This visual experience abstracts away Web3's complexity, helping people truly understand and utilize the power of ownership. \n\nAs the ultimate virtual space, the ideal Metaverse would be the perfect environment for embedding education. Its immersive nature enables learning by doing. Platform-native encounters shorten the feedback loop from theory to practice, which helps people deeply internalize their learnings. This is characteristic of an enabling environment; reading about anatomy can't compare to [doing virtual surgery](https://aithority.com/technology/blockchain/immersivetouch-metaverse-set-to-revolutionize-vr-based-surgeries-in-india/). The Metaverse would also help make education more accessible. Knowledge and information have often been gatekept by platforms and institutions. To tackle this problem, embedded education aims to redistribute and embed these into our everyday experience. We're already familiar with the Internet, thinking of it as a place; why not see it as one big university too? An open metaverse could be the new school campus.\n\nTo summarize: if Web3 enables people to own their education, the Metaverse encourages them to deeply engage with it. It does this by freeing people from Web3's complexity and connecting them with like-minded learners. \n\n#### We're ready for this future\nModern youth are already primed for this future; being immersed in digital worlds helps us transition to virtual systems like Web3. [Founder Brian Cho](https://twitter.com/brianjcho/status/1459176570174672897) discusses their advantages:\n- (Value) creation/contribution:\n- Community:\n- Culture:\n\n\nCurrently, it's difficult to see the potential these technologies hold because most mainstream use cases seem frivolous: from collecting expensive animal JPEGs to playing in clunky 3D worlds. However, [the next big thing in technology often looks like a toy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp2gbWsPFgY). This was the case with the Internet. It was initially dismissed by others; but after improving over time (i.e. lower cost, better UX), it was able to achieve widespread adoption to the point that it entrenches our daily lives. I believe a Web3-powered Metaverse is on this same path. But we still need to ensure that it's on the right track.\n\n\n### What does this game look like? (Tentative)\n#### Principles\nIf the future of education looks like a game, then it must also be a digital creative tool. In [\"Computers and Creativity\"](https://www.mollymielke.com/cc), designer Molly Mielke discusses how digital creative tools can potentially be co-creators with human beings; they foster innovation by lowering the barrier to entry, making all users toolmakers and owners. Cultivating human creativity and collaboration should also be the aspiration of an ideal education. How can this purpose be tackled by the technologies we have at our disposal? Mielke names three core concepts, which I'll apply to education:\n\n1.  Educational technology must be **standardized.** Mielke writes that standardization would fundamentally improve digital creative tools by [\"...allowing in more collaborators, making space for greater tooling innovation, and expanding a project's creative constraints beyond any one tool itself.\"](https://www.mollymielke.com/cc#stan) The future of education cannot be built alone; standardization brings both the giant manpower and diverse perspectives needed to bring it to life.\n2.  Educational technology must be **moldable.** It shouldn't just be a digital creative tool ‚Äî it must be powerful enough to be a medium for creative expression. This can be done through providing learners options for customization and support from collaborative communities. The future of education cannot serve everyone if it cannot adapt to anyone's needs.\n3.  Educational technology must be **abstracted.** By being fully responsible for executing tedious tasks, it'll allow learners to fully focus on creativity and play. The future of education cannot only target an enlightened few; for maximum accessibility, it must be hands-on, comprehensible, and participatory. \n\nOverall, in order to bring out learners' full potential, educational technology must be interoperable, moldable, efficient, and community-driven. These are all traits that a Web3-powered Metaverse has. Here's how I see this being developed to its fullest potential, especially for education.\n\n#### Single-Player Learning\nIn this Game, **learning is hands-on**. If one's objective is to master a topic, they can only prove this competency through practical experience. Currently, learners struggle to gain technical skills because the gap between theory and practice is too wide; whether you're an everyday user or an experienced developer, engaging (and building) with technology requires a ton of cognitive effort. This can be seen in learning Web3, where transactions must be understood before being approved, and programming, where [the problem must be visualized before working on it.](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/09/saving-the-world-from-code/540393/) The Game takes on the burden of comprehension by making abstract concepts feel more concrete, leaving learners to focus on critical thinking. At the same time, it would encourage them to have fun, making the steep learning curve less excruciating.\n\nLet's apply this to \"programming by demonstration\". Khan Academy already teaches like this; in their exercises, the left-hand side contains the code while the right-hand side contains the simulation of it. The Game would upgrade this simulation, turning outputs on a screen to a whole world you can interact with, like Minecraft; [it encourages computational thinking in kids through their advanced elements, like redstone and command blocks.](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/17/magazine/the-minecraft-generation.html) Another example is investing in crypto and NFTs: a wealth-building skill that anyone can benefit from. Why read instructional modules when you can experience trading instead? You can do this in [Curious Addy's Trading Club](https://www.curiousaddys.com/), where players can simulate trading cryptocurrencies and NFTs risk-free. Imagine learning other subjects through games too!\n\nIn this Game, you can **Choose Your Own Adventure.** The only requirement for leveling up is practical experience, but it's up to the player to decide how they'll gain this experience. So they customize themselves by choosing what they want to acquire, from learned skills to supported works. This is all shown on [**their own profile.**](https://www.rushil2cents.com/the-internet-as-your-resume/) Wallets could serve as the basis of profiles because they enable [everyone to have their own inventory](https://darkblueheaven.com/newinternetlogic); learners could bring their creations and credentials to whatever platform they go to. Thus, a profile can act as a dynamic resume/passport, where everything you learn and make is automatically shown on-chain.\n\nFor instance, you could get a badge for every educational experience you've attended. This is made possible through [Proof of Attendance Protocols (POAPs)](https://poap.xyz/), NFTs that serve as reliable records of life experiences. Imagine also earning tokens for learning. As a token holder, you'd be able to exchange your tokens for fiat, compensate students/teachers/creators, and make decisions regarding how the group behind the experience operates. For instance, learners in [Crypto, Culture, \u0026 Society](https://ccsdao.xyz) (liberal arts education for crypto) use their tokens for voting on the syllabus, scholarships, guests, etc. Thanks to badges and tokens, passive students become active stakeholders. By helping scale their learning platform, they increase the value of its knowledge; this impact shows on their profile, which helps in leveling up.\n\nProfiles may lead to the emergence of different classes; the profile of an artist will look different from a community builder. Self-expression is the path to leveling up online; McCormick writes: [\"... the more you signal who you are and what you care about, the more you open yourself up to new possibilities.\"](https://www.notboring.co/p/the-great-online-game) These new possibilities are opportunities (e.g. partnerships, offers, projects) that come because people are attracted to your presence. By cultivating your profile, you're **designing your own learning experience.** Nowadays, we don't have control over this;  in an era of mass-produced software, our workflows are dictated by the tools we use. The Game acknowledges our unique thought processes by enabling us [to own the ways we learn and create](https://thesephist.com/posts/tools/).\n\nIn line with this, the teachers of this Game will be full-fledged designers. They'll be designing not just content and delivery, but also environment (where are students learning?) and mechanics (what systems/rules do they have to follow?). In the Metaverse, the forms a classroom can take are endless: [an art gallery](https://oncyber.io/), [a theme park](https://www.animocabrands.com/the-sandbox-partners-with-atari), [a shopping district](https://www.republicrealm.com/metajuku)...anything you want it to be. With more people from diverse backgrounds becoming teachers, classrooms will be greatly transformed in order to fit a variety of learning styles (see [Azlen Elza's classroom design explorations).](https://twitter.com/azlenelza/status/1457346877163143170) \n\nTeachers could also incorporate tokens into the learning experience; these can track almost anything that can be tracked with a smart contract (e.g. reputation on a social platform, skills of a video game character). They could apply this to scaffolded learning: the gradual decrease of support for learners as they increase their understanding. For example, learning opportunities could come in the form of [quests and bounties](https://twitter.com/KatwellKat/status/1502302838537527302); teachers could choose to offer these for specified difficulty levels (e.g. # of XP in skill), and adjust rewards for these accordingly. Imagine all the possible ways learning could happen in this Game.\n\nIt's difficult to learn how to fully customize your education without being exposed to how others mold their own. This is where teachers come in; they act as [toolmakers](https://www.mollymielke.com/cc#mold): pioneering users that share their creations and advocate for a tool's promise. No matter what form they come in (e.g. content creators, community builders), they empower learners by inspiring them to mold their education themselves. But how does one become a teacher in the first place? This isn't just the result of gaining experience; it happens by engaging with a community. After all, what is a teacher without their students? In this Game, you can't level up without playing with others. \n\n**Notes:**\n- put more contrasts: how is suggested innovation better than what currently exists?\n- why is molding important to education?\n\n#### Multiplayer Learning\nIn the future, learning will be a **multiplayer game.** As seen with toolmakers, passionate communities are vital to the learning experiences of gaming and SaaS platforms; imagine Minecraft without its creative builders or Notion without its productivity nerds. Navigating your own education is difficult without having guides and peers supporting you. Thus, it's vital that one's learning experience has a social component; this can take any form, from casual cohorts to intense accelerators. In this Game, choosing your own adventure involves choosing your party ‚Äî the people you're learning with.\n\nIn a Web3-powered Metaverse, communities would look like DAOs, or decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs): [mission-driven groups that coordinate through blockchain-enforced rules](https://linda.mirror.xyz/Vh8K4leCGEO06_qSGx-vS5lvgUqhqkCz9ut81WwCP2o). [This structure enables learners and educators alike to collaboratively steward their education.](https://twitter.com/KatwellKat/status/1490428103612518400) DAOs could act as guilds, onboarding newbies and helping them level up in this game. A niche could exist for every type of person: artists, developers, gamers, investors, etc., and students could choose what best suits their adventure. Membership would be signified with an NFT on their profile, which would give them access to the guild's content and community. Students would grow by acquiring experience points and tokens through completing learning bounties or sharing knowledge with others.\n\nIn this Game, we can **co-create our classrooms.** The future of education can learn a lot from the open-source movement's remixing culture, where people are always building upon each other's creations. This is made possible through open standards, which ensure compatibility (e.g. extensive documentation and free licensing). Creativity also thrives because of an efficient development process (i.e. less time spent on repetitive workflows). One way to increase efficiency is by offering predefined elements. Many open-source projects serve as frameworks for builders, helping them reduce set-up time; this increases the rate of experimentation and innovation.\n\nWhen put together, building blocks form foundational structures. The Game would serve as an infrastructure for learning and creating so that learners wouldn't have to start from scratch. For example, designing your own learning journey: the data your profile contains can recommend skills you could learn, quests/experiences you could take on, people you would vibe with, etc. Teachers can benefit too; they could find a template for any learning experience they want to create. Imagine starting environments for classrooms, social mixers, conferences, etc. These would come from open-source works provided by other creators. Imagine also collaboratively creating curricula. Educational materials (i.e. syllabi, playbooks, journals) would be open-sourced. The culture of remixing will still persist; these materials will always be open to edits, comments, and updates from the general public. \n\nOne problem that can arise from enabling co-creation is attribution and compensation for creators. Whether you're developing open-source software or writing free syllabi, it's difficult to get valued for your work. This is known as the [free-rider problem](https://alisha.mirror.xyz/PxK8PtWDxon0uBH25-ACLSH1nHa89MFj--XAe_wkR6g): why would someone pay for your project when they can enjoy it for free? Web3 tackles this by providing mechanisms that ensure the recognition of creators. One example is [ENS domains](https://ens.domains/): usernames that creators can use across services. Another example is [Quadratic Funding](https://www.radicalxchange.org/concepts/quadratic-funding/): a mathematically optimal model that prioritizes projects based on how many people contributed; this encourages people to make contributions (no matter how small they are) since it's ensured that funds will be democratically allocated in a way that benefits the public. [Gitcoin Grants](https://gitcoin.co/grants/), a Web3-native Kickstarter, uses this for model funding public goods projects. Other problems that can arise are information overload and quality control. In order to tackle these, curators for these materials will be needed more than ever. Profiles can be used to determine if a person has enough experience to become a curator for a certain topic.\n\nHowever, before a learner can start getting involved in a community/project, it's likely that they'd have to go through an application process. This is currently broken for typical places for learning, like schools and workplaces. Profiles, interviews, and references aren't indicative of one's performance; they also take a lot of effort, whether you're the applicant or the evaluator. If this Game is an adventure, then finding your fellow players should be easier. Players could look for the guild/s that suit them by exploring a map, which can be filtered depending on one's interests. Each guild would have its own quest board, which explicitly state what they're looking for; players could determine if they're a fit by matching their profiles to available quests.\n\nOne Web3 startup working on this solution is [Station](https://www.station.express/vision-track-ahead), which is building \"on-chain infrastructure for onboarding \u0026 coordinating contributors of the future.\"¬†DAOs have their own terminals, which feature all their initiatives; each initiative has information on required commitment, reward(s) for contribution, recommended skills, etc. After someone applies to an initiative, they can get endorsed by existing contributors. I'm excited for the network that'll emerge on Station. It'll not only help develop an ecosystem that enables connection, but also the future of profiles: one's relationships, reputation, and identity would be represented through the on-chain contribution and relational data accrued on the platform. \n\nBy enabling co-creation, the Game shows learners that they have the power to create their own universe. A major inspiration for this vision is [Loot Project](https://www.lootproject.com/), the first community-owned NFT gaming platform. It started out as loot bags: NFTs that only consisted of 8 phrases, which depicted \"randomized adventurer gear\".  The community built on top of this, creating everything from [visual renditions of their gear](https://www.lootproject.com/#chapter2) to complex systems they can play in (e.g. [levelling infrasturcture](https://rift.live/), [society and politics](https://bannersnft.com/)). This project is why I'm a believer in Web3-powered Metaverse, showing its potential in community creation, storytelling, and world-building. This is kind of environment that best fosters learning.\n\n#### The Main Quest\nOverall, this Game is all about owning our education. The more people benefit from our learning experiences ‚Äî from designing for yourself to designing for others, the more we level up. We're playing an infinite game where school never ends; we'll always be students and teachers, learning from each other. Together, we can take on our main quest: creating a world where everyone is free to [flourish](https://en.unesco.org/futuresofeducation/sites/default/files/2021-03/Flourishing%20and%20Education_ISEEA%20Research%20Brief.pdf).\n\nIf life is a game, we all want to level up. We choose the type of game we want to play. But for too long, we've been playing finite games. We've played by the rules set by our environments, assuming that winning is the only path we can take. Now, in an technological era that encourages participation and ownership, we're starting to realize that we are free to simply play. And instead of playing against others, we can play together. So do you want to upgrade only yourself, or also help upgrade our world? Your success is up to you.\n\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.203608101Z","tags":null},"/Atlas/Projects/On-Digital-Gardening":{"title":"On Digital Gardening","content":"## Notes\nFrom my Are.na channels: [Digital Gardens](https://www.are.na/bianca-aguilar/digital-gardens-dzctygsih6y) and [Tools for Thought](https://www.are.na/bianca-aguilar/tools-for-thought-w7et3bbvndy)\n### How the Blog Broke the Web\n+ Homepages\n\t+ Built *by hand*\n\t+ no two were alike\n\t+ Dominant metaphor: table of contents \u003e diary entry\n\t+ We all became amateur librarians\n+ Early web restrictions\n\t+ Online\n\t+ HTML knowledge\n\t+ Hosting account\n+ Slow shift to rapid web publishing; instead of building their own systems, users were working inside one; from manual to effortless\n+ Chronlogical Sort era/reverse chronology bias -\u003e death of the old, cool, weird and hand-organized web\n### Of Digital Streams, Campfires and Gardens\n+ How do we build and maintain our own personal information gardens?

It‚Äôs the integrative web, the iterative web, the web as an arrangement and rearrangement of things to one another.\n\t+ ^ this is because things here don't collapse to a single set of relations/canonical sequence (see bi-directional links)\n\t+ Every walk through the garden creates new paths, new meanings, and when we add things to the garden we add them in a way that allows many future, unpredicted relationships\n\n\u003e The bridge is a bridge is a bridge ‚Äî a defined thing with given boundaries and a stated purpose. But the multi-linear nature of the garden means that there is no one right view of the bridge, no one correct approach. ==The architect creates the bridge, but it is the visitors to the park which create the bridge‚Äôs meaning.== A good bridge supports many approaches, many views, many seasons, maybe many uses, and the meaning of that bridge will even evolve for the architect over time.\n\n+ The bridge and garden are related to one another inan timeless way\n+ Same goes for everything in the garden in relation to the gardener\n+ We create the garden as a sort of **experience generator**, capable of infinite expression and meaning.\n#### The Stream\n+ newer metaphor, old roots\n\t+ programming \"event stream\"\n\t+ \"lifestream\" proposed by researchers in the 1990s\n\t+ stream -\u003e neverending parade of Twitter, news alerts, Facebook feeds\n+ In the stream metaphor you don‚Äôt experience the Stream by walking around it and looking at it, or following it to its end.

We have reached the point in the gardening hype train where people seem to think backlinks, hover previews, and visual graphs are what define a \"digital garden.\"\nThis is misguided. ==Gardening is a practice that treats a personal website as a constantly evolving landscape where you develop your ideas in public.==\nGardens are...\na) **Explorable**, rather than structured as a strictly linear steam of posts. This is usually achieved through deeply interlinking notes where readers can navigate freely through the content.\nb) **Slowly grown over time**, rather than creating \"finished\" work that you never touch again. You revise, update, and change your ideas as they develop, and ideally find a way to indicate the \"done-ness\" state to your reader.\n\n\n### Miscellaenous\n![[Extras/Media/Images/26D7A6BD-9DBA-4BFE-A725-D480113E41A4.png]]\n\n## Outline\n1.

But it can also be called, in a TL;DR way, Black Mirror in the Philippine context.\n- **Description:** The technologies that surround us uphold existing systems of power and reinforce inequalities, and Filipinos bear the brunt of all this.¬†Yet many remain unconscious of their exploitation. Given this, how can we foster Filipinos' critical consciousness of technology? To liberate ourselves from these systems, we must stimulate the imagination ‚Äî cultivating estrangement from dominant beliefs. And I believe that science fiction, as a form of technology criticism, is the best way to do this. In this project, I aim to visualize alternative technological futures in order to interrogate the systems of domination present in the Philippines.\n- **What I need help with:** I definitely need the most help with the research process, given the complexities of my project. See my linked slides for more details.\n- **Expected deadlines:** I will probably be defending my thesis this coming April, since graduation will be around June/July pa next year.\n- **Current timelines:** TBH, I'm really behind. After I finished my proposal, I was supposed to continue working on this January pa, but I got overwhelmed catching up with other subjects. Probably okay, though, since most thesis projects in Ateneo usually have a 1-year timeline. Anyways, I plan to conduct and analyze research during my first semester (August-December), then work on my creative output during my second semester (January-April/May).\n\n### HCI Contributions\n- Empirical \n- Artifact\n\n\n## Daily Notes\n```dataview\nTABLE\nFROM \"Miscellaneous Notes/Daily Notes\" AND #thesis\n```\n\n\n- [[Miscellaneous Notes/Daily Notes/2022-09-05]]\n\t- Draft topic proposal\n- [[Miscellaneous Notes/Daily Notes/2022-09-12]]\n\t- feedback from Sir.

If you go on long rides, you need to check your engine, right? Similarily, we need to constantly check ourselves when we are pursuing anything long-term in life.\n- Your incompletion (or your [[Cards/Brokenness]]) is manifested in your desires.\n- Moving forward: we will need to know how to channel these desires properly so that they can bring about a good life. \n\t- That's what [[Cards/Discernment]] is for.\n\t- What's your relationship with your desires? ==Are you mastering them, or are they mastering you?==\n\t\t- If you master them, you can convert your desire into something ==value-adding==.\n\t\t- There is no such thing as a bad desire...**at its core**. It only becomes  bad/tainted when it surfaces to the level of **action** (where it becomes destructive to you and others).\n\t\t\t- So think about what lays underneath the desire. For instance, acts of murder can be rooted in a desire for justice.\n\t\t- Desire is supposed to **free** you into becoming the person you want to be. It is **liberating.** When it's not, it becomes an **attachment** (see [[Cards/Disordered attachments]]). \n\t\t\t- They should lead you to something greater.\n\t\t- There is no such thing as the absence of desire; there is only the **ignorance** of it.\n\t\t- Contentment isn't antithetical to desire...make sure to distinguish this from settling.\n- Back to puzzles (a.k.a. Desire and its connection to [[Cards/Perfectionism]])\n\t- Do not be afraid of your imperfections; they point to the bigger story of your life.\n\t- Instead, be weary of [[Cards/Perfectionism]]; that means there's no more story left to tell.\n\t- Never ever lose sight of the bigger picture.\n\t- R.M. Rilke: \"...Live the questions now. Perhaps you will then gradually, without ntoicing it, live along some distant day into the answer.\"\n\t\t- [[The real answering comes in the living]].\n\t\t- Don't let your desires define you. Remember, there is more to a meal (a.k.a. your life) than your bread-\u0026-butter (a.k.a. core desire). Enrich it with other desires as well.\n\t\t\t- How can we find this core desire? Make sense of previous expereinces. Look at the things that have given you life. \n\t\t\t- So early in your career, make **learning** ypur biggest priority.

The ability to distinguish what is authentically good from what is only apparently good.\n- You do not discern between something that is clearly good and clearly evil (extremes of the moral spectrum).\n\t- We discern with **competing goods**.\n\t- *Pagkilatis:* the Filipino word for discernment.\n\t\t- Comes from the Spanish wood *kirates:* when a jeweler is trying to distinguish the authenticity of a diamond\n- Discernment is not just a matter of the mind (comparing pros and cons is not enough). Make sure you ==listen to your **heart** too.==\n\t- The heart is the seat of your emotions. But it is also so much more than that.\n- The heart is your **core**.\n\t- It is closer to what we know as your ==soul/essence==.\n\t- Here, you will find the seat of **your values**...what we consider important.\n\t\t- We see its value in our mind, in our experiences.\n- So pay attention to **time** and **circumstances**.\n\t- Your emotions could be ==possible reactions== to your values.\n\t- The ==tools== you need in discernment are the head and heart, which both have to work together. But ==factors we cannot control==, such as time and circumstances, bind our discernment.\n\n**The General Structure of Discernment from** Pierre-Wolf's [[Sources/The Components of Any Choice]])\n![[Extras/Media/Excalidraw/General Structure of Discernment.png]]\n\n\n**Notes:**\n- A question could be external, internal, or retrospective\n- A decision is considered good if it enables you to live better\n- Methodical work: the importance of paying attention to **data** (through journalling) and how it makes you **feel**\n\t- Wondering why certain events make you feel things points you to your values\n- On faith's influence: We discern with our values, and faith (as a transcendent source) offers **a certain set of values** that we can use.\n\t- Faith shapes your values, which in turn shape your discernment.\n\t- How does this apply to a secular context?\n\t\t- Everyone believes that human beings have dignity.\n\t\t- Christians interpret this as God's love for us (see [[Sources/Being the Beloved]])\n\t\t- If you love from a point of abundance...it comes from knowing that you have always been loved.\n\t\t- On the other hand, if you love from a point of scarcity...you will always be treating your relationships transactionally\n- Summary: LOOK -\u003e FEEL -\u003e PONDER\n\n\n### Role of faith in discernment\n- Theory: People aren't really angry at God; they're actually angry at **how it's presented to us**.\n- Religion may be divinely inspired, but it is also **humanly constructed.** \n- 2 questions:\n\t- Is the way we live out our faith appropriate to the state of our life now? \n\t- What image of God do we still hold today?\n- 2 lessons about God from St. Thomas Aquinas (See [[Sources/The Flying Spaghetti Monster, Aristotle, and Fernando Amorsolo]]):\n\t- [[God is not a being]]\n\t- [[God is the condition of possibility that enables all other beings to exist]]\n\t\t- *Ipsum Esse Subsistens*: subsistent being itself.\n\t\t- Described as an **act**\n- What we may often hear from loved ones: \"I want what is best for you\"\n\t- But how do we really know what's best for the one we love?\n- Reality: We tend to impose our desire on the one we love.\n\t- Is that really what is best for them?\n- **God does not impose his will**.\n\t- It's real love when you choose to commit...you're not forced to do it.\n\t- \"The will of God\"\n\t- **There's no blueprint.**\n- Important thought: the will of God is not imposed on us from high above, but is often something we discover from **deep within**.\n- So how can we perceive God's will? We need to examine our deepest life-giving **desires**. (Connected to [[Cards/Desire]])\n\t- If our life is a building...we can see desires as the raw material for discernment, and our head and heart as the tools we used to shape these desires.\n\t- When people say \"This is God's plan for you\", they're trying to perceive something we cannot. \n\t\t- God is the epitome of a mystery. [[Cards/Problem versus Mystery]]\n\t\t- They're trying to cope with the chaos of life by assuming order. [[Cards/Order and Chaos]]\n\t\t- This shows an absolutely certain mindset; it's better to approach God from a place of wonder. [[Cards/Absolute Certainty versus Wonder]]\n\n### Good \u0026 Evil\n- Good and evil are typically assumed to be 2 equal and opposing forces.\n\t- [[Cards/Absolute Certainty versus Wonder]] minset\n- However, according to St. [[Thomas Aquinas]], it doesn't work that way. He believed that **all there is good**. \n\t- Allows for complementarities; see [[Sources/The Need for Certainty]] and [[Cards/Order and Chaos]]\n- In line with this, his definition of evil was the **\"privation of the good\"**. (Remember: [[Evil is the privation of the good]])\n\t- It can be seen as an incomplete circle: a lack of what is supposed to be good\n\t- E.G. money being privatized so that others have a lack\n- Thus, whenever we do evil, we actually see it as **good**, even if it's done in a mistaken way.\n- Connected to [[Cards/Desire]]: The will **desires**. (e.g. \"I will teach, study, etc.\"). But desire can lead us to evil, even if it appears good.\n\t- The will is **faculty** of desire.\n- ^ Discernment helps us avoid this.\n- A lack of good = a lack of ==energy/willpower.==\n\t- One of the things that reinforces laziness is when you overthink about it.\n- If you pay attention to your good desires, how can they be opposed to God?\n\t- Just because it came from you doesn't mean it's against God\n\n### Ignatian Discernment\n- St. [[Ignatius of Loyola]] perceived discernment as **the ability to see God's will in one's life**.\n- So if God's will is perceived through our deepest life-giving desires...\n\t- This refers to our **holy** desires\n\t\t- Does not mean \"pious and out of this world\"\n\t\t- Holy comes from the word whole\n\t\t- Thus, ==holy desires are the ones that make us whole==\n- **[[Ignatian Spirituality]]:** a spirituality of desire. (See [[Cards/Desire]])\n\t- St. [[Ignatius of Loyola]] believed -- and this belief lies at the heart of [[Ignatian Spirituality]] -- that **our truest desires reflect God's desires in us and for us**.\n- We need to distinguish our **surface wants** from our **deep desires**.\n\t- This can be difficult though...like distinguishing M\u0026M's and Skittles, or distinguishing water and vodka.\n- We need to learn how to **test** our desires. This is exactly what discernment is for: to test which of our desires are authentically good, and which ones are only apprently good.\n\t- Urges are on the ==physical level== (reactive/surface, while desires are deeper , being on the ==realm of value==\n| Surface Wants                                    | Deep Desires                                        |\n| ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |\n| My desire leads me to become selfish             | My desire leads me to a healthier self              |\n| My desires disenages me from the needs of others | My desire enables me to be more available to others |\n| My desire is governed by fear                    | My desire is driven by love                                                    |\n\n- St. [[Ignatius of Loyola]]'s greatest contribution: **[[Sources/The Spiritual Exercises]]**\n\t- Full form: 30-day retreat where you give yourself to God\n\t- Begins with [[Cards/The First Principle and Foundation]], where you **articulate the ultimate goal of your life**\n\n![[Sources/The Spiritual Exercises#Annotation 23]]\n\n- Remember: **Our deepest, most life-giivng desires are God's desires for us.**\n\t- St. Iraneus: *\"[[Cards/Gloria dei vivens homo]]\"* (\"The glory of God is the human person fully alive.\")\n\n#### How do I know I'm on the right path in discernment?\n- Ask yourself: Are you **at peace** with your decision?\n\t- What being at peace looks like: **a stability and sernity the comes from a sense of rightness**\n\t\t- Note: this does not use the word \"happy\"...\n\t\t- ...because sometimes we now that the right decision is also the difficult decision...\n\t\t- ...and that serenity and stability don't come right away\n\t- The goal of discernment is **peace**.\n- So how can you tell if you're at peace? Through 2 movements in discernment: [[Cards/Consolation]] and [[Cards/Desolation]]\n- **Important notes:** ^6b4c48\n\t- [[Cards/Consolation]] and [[Cards/Desolation]] are **interior movements**. They are felt, but they are more than just emotions.\n\t- Sometimes the **right decision** can be accompanied by initial feelings of **sadness** and **doubt**, and **the wrong decision** may start with feelings of **happiness** and **clarity**.\n\t\t- Thus, it is important to pay attention to the ==long-term trajectory==\n\n#### Indifference\n- In the Ignatian sense, **indifference** means looking at your decisions from a fresh and balanced perspective\n\t- Balacing [[Cards/Order and Chaos]]\n- **Ignatian Indifference:** **maintaining a vision** of the whole\n\t- Settling one's life in balance before all created things\n\t- Note: the heart of our attachments is a distinct [[Cards/Brokenness]] in our character\n- There is indeed a difference between happiness and joy.\n\n| Happiness                                                                                                                                       | Joy                                                         |\n| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |\n| It is an emotional state (therefore fleeting).

This means ==you can move both forward and backward in the process. ==\n\t- Given an observed data point, you can sample from the latent space and generate a similar data point by reversing the diffusion process. This property is crucial for generating new data samples.\n- **Generative Modeling:** Latent Diffusion Models are generative models, meaning ==they can generate new data samples that resemble the training data. ==\n\t- To generate a new sample, you start with a random noise vector in the latent space and apply the inverse diffusion process to generate data in the high-dimensional space. \n\t- These generated samples can be used for various applications, such as image synthesis, data denoising, or data completion.\n- **Training:** Training a Latent Diffusion Model involves learning the parameters of the model, including the parameters that define the diffusion process and the mapping between the latent space and the high-dimensional data space. \n\t- Training typically involves optimizing a likelihood function that measures how well the model can reproduce the training data.\n","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.20760808Z","tags":null},"/Cards/Liberal-education":{"title":"Liberal education","content":"## Reference\n- **Source:** [[Sources/Our Way Out - Close Collaboration Between Liberal and Vocational Education - Essay]]\n- **Keywords:** [[Cards/permanent notes]]\n- **Relevant Notes:** \n\t- [[Cards/Vocational education]]\n## Notes\n### What is liberal education?\n+ Manifested in the form of colleges and universities\n+ Exists as a space and time for students to:\n\t+ Expose themselves to a wide array of disciplines\n\t+ Prepare students for a continuously-changing democratic society\n\t+ Learn from professors whose work isn't driven by profit-maximization","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.20760808Z","tags":null},"/Cards/LoRa-Models":{"title":"\"LoRa Models\"","content":"## Reference\n- **Source:** https://civitai.com/models/22530\n- **Keywords:** [[Cards/permanent notes]]\n- **Relevant Notes:** \n\t- [[Miscellaneous Notes/Stable Diffusion|Stable Diffusion]]\n## Notes\n- **LoRa (Low Rank Adaptation)** is a new technique for fine-tuning deep learning models.

This is because the Lora absorbs details that can't be described easily with words, such as faces and accessories. \n\t- Knowing this you can let those details be absorbed into an¬†**activation tag**, which is a ==unique word or phrase== that goes at the start of every text file, and which makes your Lora ==easy to prompt.==\n\n1.

Modernism\n\t- Romanticism: the reality \u0026 identity are **external**\n\t\t- E.G. Keats' poem, which exhibits aspiration\n\t- Modernism: the reality \u0026 identity are **internal**\n\t\t- E.G. Shakespheare's poem, which exhibits inevitability\n- One takeaway: despite knowing that life is finite, ==the process of *truly* be-ing itself seems to be what life is all about==\n\n- Related concepts to the modern:\n\t- **Identity**\n\t\t- Existence of stable, coherent ‚Äúself‚Äù, independent of culture and society.  \n\t\t- Identity is static: one either¬†_is_¬†one's racial, ethnic, national or gender identity (the traditional view) or ==one has an innate identity which should be separated from social influences== (Rousseau's romantic view).\n\t- **Absurdity**\n\t\t- Albert Camus defines the absurd as ==the tension created by humanity's need for meaning and the universe's refusal to provide any.== We can find no evidence for the existence of God, so all we are left with is an indifferent universe where bad things happen without a higher purpose or justification.\n\t\t- Absurd literary works¬†**present**¬†and¬†**explore**¬†the absurd nature of existence. They took a good look at the fact that ==there is no inherent meaning in life, yet we keep on living and keep trying to find meaning.== This was achieved by being themselves absurd in form or plot or both.\n\t- **Fragmentation**\n\t\t- Modernist literature embraces fragmentation as a literary form, since it reinforces the ==fragmentation of reality and contradicts¬†notions of totality and wholeness.==\n\t- **Alienation**\n\t\t- The basic form of ==rootlessness==\n\t\t- Result of ==loss of identity==, which emerges as natural consequences of ==existential predictament==\n\t\t- The dispossessed personality's search for identity is a common place theme in modern fiction. Man fails to perceive today the very purpose behind life and the relevance of his existence in a hostile world.\n\n### Freud and Jung on the psyche\n\n- The **internal life** is the cardinal element of the modernist sensibility.

The primary mechanism through which the damaged brain can repair and restore itself is called ‚Äúneuroplasticity.‚Äù\n\n\u003e Neuroplasticity is defined as ==the ability of the brain to form and reorganize the synaptic connections between neurons.== Neuroplasticity is an essential component of the learning process and of the brain‚Äôs response to injury, including traumatic brain injury (TBI) and stroke. Essentially, neuroplasticity refers to ==the brain‚Äôs ability to ‚Äúrewire‚Äù itself in response to new experiences and information.==\n\u003e Neuroplasticity is a two-way street; stressful, traumatic experiences impact neuroplasticity, causing the brain to develop and repeatedly utilize maladaptive pathways that are not conducive to optimal health.

More precisely, ressentiment is the sublimated spirit of revenge, the masked and muted desire to prevail over one's stronger rival. While envy, jealousy, and rivalry can contribute to it, they are not exactly the same. Ressentiment is a reaction. In ressentiment, literally \"re-feeling\", one feels the importence of frustrating encounters with one's superior rivals.\n\n\u003e According to Scheler, one experiences a morbid attraction to return again and again to painful defeats. As ressentiment feeds on the revisited feeling, it grows and develops, engendering a painful tension that eventually finds release in the denigration of the rival's values and the exaltation of their opposites. Ressentiment leads frustrated underdogs to invert all that is valuable to their stronger, more attractive, morally superior, more capable or successful rivals. It leads the weak to denigrate strength, the unlettered to belittle letters, and the poor to disparage wealth and power. Ressentiment leads sinners to debunk virtue and losers to redefine winning. It doesn't only affect the way people think. Above all, ressentiment modifies their spontaneous reaction (attraction, repugnance) to people, practices, and institutions that humiliate them.\n\n### Psychology Wiki\n\u003e _Ressentiment_¬†is a profound sense of¬†[resentment](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Resentment \"Resentment\"),¬†[frustration](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Frustration \"Frustration\"), and¬†[hostility](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Hostility \"Hostility\")¬†directed at that which one identifies as the¬†cause¬†of one's frustration, generated by a sense of weakness/inferiority and feelings of¬†[jealousy](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Jealousy \"Jealousy\")/[envy](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Envy \"Envy\")¬†in the face of the 'cause', that ultimately generates a rejecting/justifying '[value system](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Value_system \"Value system\")' or¬†[morality](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Morality \"Morality\")¬†that exists as a means of attacking or denying the perceived source of one's own sense of inferiority.\n\n\u003e Ressentiment is a reassignment of the pain that accompanies a sense of one's own inferiority/failure onto an external 'scapegoat', which scapegoat is itself the thing that 'made' one realize one's own inferiority/failure. Yet a fully internalized ressentiment can turn one against oneself; thus, there is often an irony attached to it.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.20760808Z","tags":null},"/Cards/SMART-Objectives":{"title":"SMART Objectives","content":"## Reference\n- **Source:** #EDUC130_3 \n- **Keywords:** [[Cards/permanent notes]]\n\t- #education #teaching #learning \n- **Relevant Notes:** \n\t- [[Cards/Blooms Taxonomy|Blooms Taxonomy]]\n## Notes\n\n- **Specific**¬†- The learning objective should be well defined and clear.¬†It states exactly what will be accomplished.\n- **Measurable**¬†- The learning objective should provide a benchmark or target so that the institution can determine when the target has been reached, by how much it has been exceeded or by how much it has fallen short.\n- **Attainable -**¬†Can the objective be accomplished in the proposed time frame with the available resources and support?

It's basically all about unplugging and retreating from technology. \n- driven by [[Cards/Fear of Being Ordinary]] and ego-attachment\n\n\u003e ==philosophy of relating to technology== I call Waldenponding (after ==Thoreau's Walden Pond experiment== on which Walden is based). The crude caricature is \"smash your smart phone and go live in a log cabin to reclaim your attention and your life from being hacked by evil social media platforms.\"\n\n### Against Waldenponding 2\n- Waldenponding is the ==demonization of digital devices.== \n\t- But devices are actually more like magic tricks; they're designed by humans to misdirect your attention.\n\t- Manipulate you into creating Walden ponds\n\n\u003e  ==Waldenponding = primitivist, fetishistic fear of screens as demonic objects.== A way of relating to digital devices that seems shaped by a fearmongering vision of them as soul-sucking pumps, and their designers as Dark Lords who are far too powerful for you, mere mortal,  to actively resist. Your only reliable weapon, they say, is the off switch.\n\n\u003e  ==demonization of digital devices== -- perfectly ordinary objects governed by the laws of physics and designed by mere humans --  is something like a magic trick, where the magician wants to misdirect your attention. While you're busy worrying about the evil rectangles of light stealing your soul, you are missing the real danger: the horcruxes they are tempting you to create and trust with legibilized, dead bits of your soul.\n\n- Waldenponding is a search for meaning similar to ==idolization.== The idol here can be anything that's not a digital device.\n\t- E.G. paper book, session of manual labor, hike in the woods\n\t- They act as tangible focal points which the quests (for meaning) ==revolve around,== preventing one from going too far.\n\t- This is what makes Waldenponding dangerous, and it's worse because it's ==seen as a way to do the opposite== (idolization)\n\n\u003e  Waldenponding is a search for meaning that is ==circumscribed by the what you might call the spiritual gravity field of an object or behavior held up as ineffably sacred.== The associated literal pattern of religiosity is idolatry. Today, the ==\"idol\"== in question is generally characterized by negative definition as ==\"almost anything other than the profane digital device screen.\"== It can take a variety of forms: the in-person conversation, the board game, the hike in the woods, the session of manual labor, the construction project, the family dinner, the paper book. All are excellent things, to be valued for what they literally are. But as suggested repositories for bits of your soul, they are incredibly dangerous.\n\n\u003e  the loci at the hearts of the narratives are more than mere motifs or synecdoches for larger spiritual quests. They serve as ==physically embodied focal points around which the quests themselves revolve,== like strange attractors. Though the protagonists may, through the narrative, explore the universe in much more expansive ways, you can see where they keep bits of their souls locked down; the zone that keeps drawing them back; the idol that prevents them from wandering too far.\n\n\u003e  Each in its natural form is a perfectly fine thing. ==It is only when transformed into sacralized fragments of \"soul\" that they turn into dangerous Dark Magic objects. Waldenponding is dangerous because it encourages you to do exactly that.== The effect is particularly insidious because it is presented as a way to do the opposite.\n\n- Waldenponding prevents us from experiencing all that life has to offer.","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.20760808Z","tags":null},"/Cards/We-grow-when-we-let-go":{"title":"We grow when we let go","content":"## Reference\n- **Source:** [[Cards/Absolute Certainty versus Wonder]]\n- **Keywords:** [[Cards/permanent notes]]\n\t- #life #personaldevelopment \n- **Relevant Notes:** \n## Notes\n![[Cards/Absolute Certainty versus Wonder#^952b2f]]","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.20760808Z","tags":null},"/Cards/We-operate-our-everyday-lives-on-unfounded-certitudes":{"title":"We operate our everyday lives on unfounded certitudes","content":"## Reference\n- **Source:**[[Sources/The Need for Certainty]]\n- **Keywords:** [[Cards/permanent notes]]\n\t- #philosophy \n- **Relevant Notes:** \n## Notes","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.20760808Z","tags":null},"/Cards/We-serve-others-through-our-emotional-labor":{"title":"We serve others through our emotional labor","content":"## Reference\n- **Source:** [[Seth Godin]]; [[Sources/This is Marketing - Book]]\n- **Keywords:** [[Cards/permanent notes]]\n\t- #people #psychology \n- **Relevant Notes:**\n\t- [[Cards/Publicity is costly]]\n\t- [[Cards/Everybody gets to choose what they worship]]\n\t- [[Cards/The best way to serve others with our work is to serve the work]]\n## Notes\n- **Definition:** the process of managing feelings and expressions to fulfill the emotional requirements of a job\n- mostly seen with service workers","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.20760808Z","tags":null},"/Cards/Willpower-and-motivation-is-finite":{"title":"Willpower and motivation is finite","content":"## Reference\n- **Source:** [[Sources/In Online Ed Content Is No Longer King - Cohorts Are - Essay]]\n- **Keywords:** [[Cards/permanent notes]]\n- **Relevant Notes:** \n\t- [[Cards/More access does not translate to more engagement]]\n\t- [[Cards/You have agency over your own attention]]\n## Notes\nSelf-directed programs (i.e. workout programs, diet plans, online courses) rely on ==learners' willpower \u0026 motivation== to stick through a course.

Resource Notes/Monomythical - Newsletter]] **(24: Monasteries)**\n\t- We're so obsessively focused on getting through a normal day-to-day that we can't even see how much we've lost. Even now, I'm typing this while trying to figure out which daybed to order for my living room and whether to enroll my new cat in kitten kindergarten.

It‚Äôs gonna be the work, the creative work of millions of people who can each add their own elements to it through content creation and programing and design. And the other way of adding value.\n\t- So it will be a massively participatory medium of a type that we really haven‚Äôt seen yet.\n\t- the critical thing with this effort is to build out not just a 3D platform and to have technical standards, but also a fair economy in which all creators can participate, make money and be rewarded in an economy with both the principles ensuring that customers are treated fairly\n\t- But also one in which companies have the freedom to release their own content and to profit from it.\n\t- much greater engine for economic efficiency than any of the closed systems that exist today. And that we‚Äôd ultimately get to a point where a much higher percentage of the profits go to creators than with any of these other platforms that currently exist. And that when money is going to people who are not creators, it‚Äôs really done through competitive dynamics to ensure that their costs and their profits are very, very reasonable relative to the service they‚Äôre performing.\n\t- I think interconnecting systems is a great way to to to move forward with this. We have XBOX Live, we have Steam, there‚Äôs Nintendo switch, there‚Äôs the PlayStation Network. There are a bunch of these disconnected systems. We should start connecting them together.\n\t- We have several different game engines, each competing really robustly. But we need standards that we can start agreeing on. And there are already some really great ones, like the Pixar USD scene format for interchanging 3D scenes. That‚Äôs one of your standards for materials. We need standards for networking so you can have a multiplayer game in which some people participating are using a client on Unreal engine and some people participating are using a client that‚Äôs built in Unity. Like really being able to create standards for an interoperability so that everybody can have access to this.\n\t- Economic efficiency not only means a better environment for companies to do business, but also means a much fairer environment for consumers.\n\t- First and foremost, these platforms should be truly open to competition. You can come in and say the revenue sharing should be X or Y.\n\t- But really, the core problem here is that the revenue sharing is not determined by free market competition. If the revenue sharing is determined by free market competition, then maybe Apple and Google can charge a premium if their services warrant it. But right now, rates are completely disconnected from any competitive barometer. And so they‚Äôre not honest rates and they‚Äôre distorted and for different reasons.\n- [[Sources/Ortographic media - Article]]\n\t-  [context collapse](http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2013/12/08/coining-context-collapse.html): the standardization of all events, no matter how big or small, delightful or traumatic, to fit the same mashed-together timeline.\n\t-  First, what would it look like for a social media platform to re-establish perspective?

(This is obviously related to my broad interest in adding more negative feedback (https://platforms.fyi/) to these platforms.)\n\t-  Second, in the absence of any such attenuation, I think a practical and healthy thing that any user of social media can do when confronted with a free-floating cube of news is ask: how big is this, really?

(Book)]]\n\t-  we should remind ourselves of how technology's role is to serve us as humans ‚Äî not to limit our humanity or to take advantage of our vices but, rather to make us more human.\n\t-  **CHAPTER 1: INTERFACES ARE FOR INFORMATION**\n\t\t-  The purpose of any interface, regardless of the technology, is to retrieve, decode, modify, and/or distribute information.\n\t\t-  As designers, our job is to consider information first and then the interface as the medium through which to interact with information second. \n\t\t-  Our job is to design communication, or rather to encode information in a way that it can be reliably decoded by another human being. This is different from the purpose of an artist who encodes meaning loosely in such a way that it can be decoded loosely in an infinite number of ways.\n\t\t-  the Latin alphabet is the cornerstone of the interfaces we design\n\t\t-  Throughtout history, each form of information technology, such as the alphabet, has corresponded with a different interface‚Äîor mechanism‚Äîto retrieve, decode, modify and/or distribute that information. Each of these evolutions in information has, in turn, corresponded with changes in human behavior, each unlocking a more effective way for more humans to maximize the utility of information.  \n\t\t-  Each new information technology is often met with resistance and confusion in its early stages (think [TikTok](https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2020/8/3/tiktok-and-the-sorting-hat)) as it takes shape and iterates to become an effective tool. \n\t\t-  Instead of encoding information via language alone, the GUI uses a much richer multilayered approach to simultaneously encode information via language, symbolism, hierarchy, and context to produce an interactive interface.\n\t\t-  GUI the first digital information mechanism that included [affordances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordance) for how a user could utilize the encoded information\n\t\t-  The core purpose of a GUI is not to be pretty, but to be informative\n\t-  **CHAPTER 2: DESIGN AS DANCE**\n\t\t-  Design isn't a march toward something known. Design, instead, is more like a dance‚Äînever done and almost always a little off the first time. \n\t\t-  Design is an exploration of what feels right, making iteration an essential foundation of our discipline.\n\t\t-  Every technology comes with drawbacks but adoption is achieved when the value outweighs the cost.\n\t\t-  The Cyclical Evolution of Information Encoding Methods \u0026 Interface Design\n\t\t\t-  Symbolism and Alphabets\n\t\t\t-  Graphical User Interface\n\t\t\t-  Voice-based Interfaces\n\t\t\t-  Voice + Touch Display\n\t-  **CHAPTER 3: WE INTERFACE BECAUSE WE ARE HUMAN**\n\t\t-  We interface precisely because we are human. Because we are intelligent, because we are social, because we are inquisitive and creative. \n\t\t-  We design our interfaces and they in turn redefine what it means to be human.\n\t ![[Extras/Media/Images/Human Hand.png]]\n\t\t- My hope is that as we design our future interfaces we become a little less caught up in the novelty of technologies or aesthetic style and first think a bit more about what future humans we want to be. \n\t-  **FINAL CHAPTER: FUTURE FANTASY OR FUTURE TOMORROW?**\n\t\t-   By knowing the history of technology, information, design, and interfaces we can work toward a more purposeful and intentional future.\n\t\t- We can ask ourselves five questions as we design these interfaces:\n\t\t\t1. How does the interface help us retrieve information?\t\n\t\t\t2. Is it easy to decode the information that was retrieved?\n\t\t\t3. Does the interface allow for easy and clear modification of information?\n\t\t\t4. Does the interface assist in, and clearly declare when it is going to distribute information?\n\t\t\t5. How will this interface redefine what it means to be human?\n- [[Everyone Deserves Great Design (Book)]]\n\t- **1.

This definition was extrapolated to general usage as something told or communicated, whether or not it made sense to the receiver.\n- Information -\u003e communication\n- *\"communication of instructive knowledge.\"*\n- Information = ==data==\n- Information is ==organized data that is made meaningful to a specific audience to serve a purpose.== \n\t- [[Cards/All useful things should be beautiful]]\n- Information and ultimately communication is in the very ==fabric of our humanity.==\n##### What is an Information Environment?\n- spaces that contain information, and where we interact with them\n- can be both physical and digital\n- can extend from multiple systems -\u003e smaller spaces like a page\n- e.g. library\n\n\n**3 Elements:**\n1. **Content:** information itself\n2. **Consumer:** interacts with content and operates under  a context\n3. **Context:** circumstances of the situation and the environment\n\n##### Information Environments\n![[Extras/Media/Images/IA Venn Diagram.png]]\n###### Content\n- information in the envrionment = content\n- **Architecture:** the art/practice of designing ==structure==\n- pioneered by architect Richard Saul Wurman\n\t- *\"creating structure to information to yield meaning\"*\n- IA is everywhere around us\n- What isn't IA:\n\t- Visual design\n\t- Software development\n- Good Information Architecture helps people ==understand their surroundings and find what they‚Äôre looking for== - in the real world as well as online.\n\t- **Components of good IA:**\n\t\t- Organization\n\t\t\t- *\"We organize to understand, to explain, and to control.

What is are the probable circumstances of being in that space? What are possible constraints can be gleaned from the space?\n\nOne flawed information environment I've recently encountered is the Ateneo Integrated Student Information System a.k.a. AISIS. It's a digital environment that, true to its name, presents vital student information, such as the IPS, grades, etc. Students mainly use this to enlist in their classes. However, due to its cluttered and unintuitive interface (i.e. miniscule text, hard to press buttons), the enlistment process ends up becoming stressful and overwhelming for students. One way I'd improve AISIS is refreshing its typography system. For me, the currrent font being used, along with its size (especially for body text) isn't the most readible; as a result, it's easy to miss classes while enlisting. Improving the typography would definitely make enlistment easier.\n\n## Socsci 12\n#sociology\n### Ideas of Modernity\n1. Newer technology\n2. Use of tools to help do work\n3. Exact measurements\n4.

These meanings are what we hope to see, emphasize, feel, experience and practice as we move forward with our lessons in this course.\n\t- Social: This word denotes ==humanity and the relationships we have established and maintained.== Are these relationships life-giving and liberating? Or are these hindering us and others from living a life with dignity and fullness? In this course, we hope to understand the beginnings and developments of these relationships and what roles do we play in them, to assess their impacts to the lives of people, and to discern how we can contribute in sustaining life-giving relations or dismantling those which are oppressive and destructive. In light of this, we will give much attention to the plight of those who are marginalized in and by the society. \n\t- Vision: Vision has an extensive range of meanings too. In Module 0, I used the words: ==plans, goals and dreams interchangeably with vision.== In this course, we hope to create and work on visions/plans/goals/dreams not only for our selves but also for our community, society and world: a SOCIAL VISION. A popular term coined now due to the pandemic is NEW NORMAL and how we should all strive to adapt to it. But, what if instead of saying NEW NORMAL, why not have a BETTER NORMAL in this world? What does our faith tell us to do as we  participate in creating a BETTER WORLD? Vision could also mean what we see, observe and perceive not only with our eyes but also with our hearts and minds. This entails awareness, consciousness, sensitivity and critical understanding of the world we are living in. What and whose lens are we using? Do we make an effort to place ourselves in the shoes of the other or are we too blind and indifferent to do this? This calls for humility and willingness to learn/relearn/unlearn things from various perspectives while keeping a critical stance so that the truth is always promoted. And lastly, this calls for empathy and solidarity- to embrace the causes of those who are neglected and pushed away towards the peripheries in whatever ways and forms.\n- **DEFINITIONS PT. 2:**\n\t- Salvation: The forgiveness of sins and restoration of friendship with God, which can be done by God alone.\n\t- Kingdom of God:\n\t\t- The Catechism of the Catholic Church (CCC) teaches that the coming Reign of God will be a ==kingdom of love, peace, and justice.==[7] Justice is defined as a virtue whereby one respects the rights of all persons, living in harmony and equity with all.[8] The kingdom of God began with ==Christ's death and resurrection== and must be further extended by Christians until it has been brought into perfection by Christ at the end of time.[9]\n\t\t- Catholics do this by ==living the way Christ lived, by thinking the way Christ thought,[7] and by promoting peace and justice.[10]== This can be accomplished by discerning how the Holy Spirit (God) is calling one to act in the concrete circumstances of one's life.[10] Christians must also pray, asking God for what is necessary to cooperate with the coming of God's kingdom.[11] Jesus gathered disciples to be the seed and the beginning of God's Reign on earth, and Jesus sent the Holy Spirit to guide them.[12] Jesus continues to call all people to come together around him[13] and to spread the kingdom of God across the entire world.[14]\n\t\t- However, ==the ultimate triumph of Christ's kingdom will not come about until Christ's return to earth at the end of time.[15]== During Christ's second coming, he will judge the living and the dead. Only those who are judged to be righteous and just will reign with Christ forever.[16] Christ's second coming will also mark the absolute defeat of all evil powers, including Satan.[17] Until then, the coming of the kingdom will continue to be attacked by evil powers as Christians wait with hope for the second coming of their Savior.[18]\n\t- Fullness of Life:\n\t\t- It is a term used to refer to ==Christian teachings on fullness of life.== It is not an organized movement or a unique doctrine, but a name applied to the ==teachings and expectations of the groups and people who follow the teachings.== Abundant life teachings may include expectations of prosperity and health,[1] but may also include other forms of fullness of life when faced with adverse circumstances.[2]\n\t\t- The term \"abundant life\" comes from the Bible verse John 10:10b, \"I have come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.\"[2] \"More abundantly\" means to have a superabundance of a thing. \"Abundant life\" refers to life in its abounding fullness of joy and strength for spirit, soul and body.[3] \"Abundant life\" signifies a contrast to feelings of lack, emptiness, and dissatisfaction, and such feelings may ==motivate a person to seek for the meaning of life and a change in their life.[4]==\n\t- Gospel:\n\t\t- ?\n\t- Love: *(see charity)*\n\t\t- Drawing on the words of St Paul, Christianity traditionally teaches that there are three virtues that are to be prized over all the others. These are called the theological virtues: ==faith, hope and charity== (1 Corinthians 13:13). Charity is the theological virtue by which ==we love God above all things for his own sake, and our neighbour as ourselves for the love of God.== (Catechism of the Catholic Church, n. 1822) Charity is most often translated as ‚Äòlove‚Äô, and its Greek root is agape. This refers to the ==love that God bestows on his creation and the love that we are commanded to show to our neighbours. This love has its source and ultimate goal in God.==\n\t\t- ‚ÄòCharity in truth [‚Ä¶] is the principal driving force behind the authentic development of every person and of all humanity. Love ‚Äì caritas ‚Äì is an extraordinary force which leads people to opt for courageous and generous engagement in the field of justice and peace.‚Äô Benedict XVI, Caritas In Veritate ‚Äì ‚ÄúCharity In Truth‚Äù (2009), paragraph 1\n\t- Justice:\n\t\t- ?\n\t- Evangelization: The ==proclamation of Christ and his Gospel== (from the Greek: evangelion) by word and the testimony of life, in fulfillment of Christ's command.\n\t- Church: The name given to ==the \"convocation\" or \"assembly\" of the People God has called together from \"the ends of the earth.\"== In Christian usage, the word \"Church\" has three inseparable meanings: ==the People that God gathers in the whole world; the particular or local Church diocese; and the liturgical assembly.== The Church draws her life from the word and the Body of Christ, and so herself becomes Christ's body. In the Creed, the sole Church of Christ is professed to be one, holy, catholic, and apostolic.\n\t- Mission:\n\t\t- *Trinitarian missions:* To accomplish the ==divine plan of the triune God for the redemption of humanity==, ==the Son and the Holy Spirit were \"sent\" into the world==: hence the Trinitarian \"missions\" (Latin missus means \"sent\").\n\t\t- *Apostolic mission:* Just as he was sent by the Father, ==Jesus sent his Apostles into the world to continue his own saving mission.== Church as mission: Thus the Church is missionary by its very nature, continuing the mission or work of Christ through the Holy Spirit, according to the plan of God. This apostolic mission of the Church is fulfilled according to their different states of life by the clergy, laity, and religious. Missionary activity is sometimes given in a more specific sense as the work of initial evangelization and establishment of the Church in non-Christian lands.\n\t- Catholic Social Tradition: The Catholic social tradition is a comprehensive term that captures ==the dynamic between Catholic social teaching, thought, and practice.== This dynamic tradition includes a rich history that helps us to see our social responsibilities in the world ‚Äî Scripture, the early church fathers, medieval experience, the various theologians, philosophers, economists, political thinkers, and the countless witnesses throughout the ages. Thus, we need to remind ourselves that the Catholic social tradition did not begin in 1891, but brings us back to the Old Testament and draws upon everything in the life and thought of the church. The social tradition, therefore, is broader and older than the formal social teachings of the church. It provides an intellectual framework and legacy informed by practice and experience from which the more recent (1891 to the present) social teachings draw.\n\n### Catholic Social Teaching\n- set of principles for a just and peaceful  society\n- *\"You shall love your neighbor as you love yourself\"*\n- everyone is made in the image of God, giving them fundamental worth that can't be erased\n- we're  communal and social, just as God is triune \n\n**7 TENETS:**\n1. Every human life has value and dignity\n2. The most basic building block for society to flourish is families\n3. In every society, there are rights and responsibilities\n4. The option for the poor\n5. The dignity of  work and the rights of workers\n6. Solidarity\n7. Humans are stewards of God's creation\n\n- Charity is incomplete unless it is lived out through justice.\n- Justice: giving each one what is rightfully due to them\n- Catholic Social Justice:  doing wht is right to be in right relationship with God, one another, and all of creation\n- difference with charity: it deals with the causes, while charity deals with the consequences\n\n**7 PRINCIPLES:**\n1.  Care for Creation\n2.  Human Dignity\n3.  Family and Community\n4.  Rights and Responsibilities\n5.  Preferential Option for the Poor\n6.  Dignity of Workers\n7.

Leo was acutely aware of the ==poverty of many workers and of the growth in power of socialist movements.==\n- **Quadragesimo Anno**\n\t- 1931\n\t- \"On the Fortieth Year\"\n\t- Pope Pius XI\n\t- ==Dictatorship== is condemned as the dangers of ==fascism and communism== are exposed ‚Äì such as increasing child and female labour.\n\t- This ==mid depression provoked new thinking== as opposed to the previous preoccupation with World War I. The growth of systematic atheism had increased, the modernist crisis arose and there were huge developments in thought. Germany was economically devastated and Russia allowed many of its own people to die ‚Äì justified as necessary for the good of the state.\n- **Mater et Magistra**\n\t- 1961\n\t- \"Mother and Teacher\"\n\t- Pope John XXIII\n\t- It states the need for a ==balance between excessive intervention of the state against the need for state intervention to curb injustices and assist socialisation.== It also goes on to advocate worker participation and ownership and marks the beginning of a focus on international poverty rather than its previous concentration on industrialised countries.\n\t- ==Communism== was still viewed as being a major threat and since World War II there was an increasing concern for poorer nations and international inequalities.\n- **Pacem in Terris**\n\t- 1963\n\t- \"Peace on Earth\"\n\t- Pope John XXIII\n\t- First addressed to ‚Äòall people of goodwill‚Äô and underlines the ==rights and responsibilities of individuals.== This document also ==condemns the arms race and racism== and ==advocates resources== to be shared in the common endeavour for development\n\t- The terrifying threat of ==nuclear war== had become heightened with the Berlin Wall and the Cuban Missile Crisis. In addition, the civil rights movement in the US had also exposed ==divisions of race.==\n- **Gaudium et Spes**\t\n\t- 1965\n\t- \"The Joys and Hopes\"\n\t- Second Vatican Council (Pope Paul  VI)\n\t- This document underlined the need of the church to be ==completely immersed== in human affairs and for the church to share the joys and hopes of people.\n\t- Demonstrates the idea that the church needs to ==‚Äòinterpret the signs of the times‚Äô.== Although this was a document by the Second Vatican Council rather than an encyclical, it was none the less significant. The Vatican II was a pastoral council which firmly showed the significance of the church in the world rather than it being of spiritual concern only, and this was a ‚Äòconstitution‚Äô of Vatican II ‚Äì voted for by a majority of the bishops and was therefore hugely important for Catholic Social Teaching\n- **Dignitatis Humanae**\n\t- 1965\n\t- \"Human Dignity\"\n\t- Another Second Vatican document rather than an encyclical\n\t- Essentially a declaration of ==religious freedom== and the call for all Christians to respect religious freedom, a freedom which must also be permitted by states. The church must be allowed to work freely, but compulsion or force must play no part in a person‚Äôs response to God\n\t- This was one of the most contentious of all of the Vatican documents with much of the initiative coming from the US church favouring ==secularism.== As a result this was opposed (and still is today) by many conservatives favouring the involvement of the church in the state as was seen in Spain and Italy, and as the church had acted up until the early 20th.\n- **Populorum Progressio**\n\t- 1967\n\t- \"The Progress of Peoples\"\n\t- Pope Paul VI\n\t- Pope Paul VI most famously stated that ==‚Äòdevelopment is the new name for peace‚Äô== and he goes onto express dangers of conflict if inequalities grew. The whole area of human development is examined from an ==integral and holistic viewpoint== rather than development just being based on economic factors.\n\t- This was the concern for the signs of the times (in practical terms) as ==the Second Vatican had not fleshed out its ideas for development.== Paul VI had also travelled widely and now international communications were bringing issues such as global poverty into closer proximity due to newer technologies such as television.\n- **Octogesima Adveniens**\n\t- 1971\n\t- \"On the Eightieth Year\"\n\t- Pope Paul VI\n\t- strictly an ==‚Äòapostolic letter‚Äô== rather than an encyclical.\n\t- Further reference is made in this letter to ‚ÄòThe Condition of Labour‚Äô, and Paul VI lists approximately fifteen key issues presenting problems. Paul VI expresses that a variety of responses should be offered as the Christian solution. He also states that ==Christians should be called to action to involve themselves in building a just world by analysing their own realities and devising responses in light of the Gospel.==\n\t-  The South American bishops had met at Medellin three years earlier and their ==themes of structural injustice, the option for the poor, conscientisation and liberatio==n permeate the thinking in this document.\n- **Justicia in Mundo**\n\t- 1971\n\t- \"Justice in the World\"\n\t- Sensitive to the concerns of the developing world, it noted a ==‚Äútremendous paradox‚Äù facing the world contrasting the abundance of resources with the divisions== and ==‚Äúcrisis of solidarity‚Äù facing the world (no. 7). (Solidarity is recognition that we are all one human family.)== The Synod calls for structural change and ‚Äúliberation from every oppressive situation‚Äù facing members of the human family. It notes the failure of development, overspending on armaments, environmental damage, the domination of the economic system by wealthy nations, and the lack of access by poor countries to those things necessary to fulfill their ‚Äúright‚Äù to development.   Calling for solidarity with developing nations, the Synod writes that action by the Church ‚Äúon behalf of justice and participation in the transformation of the world fully appear to us as a ‚Äúconstitutive,‚Äù or essential, dimension of the preaching of the Gospel‚Äù (no. 6).\n- **Evangelii Nunitiandi**\n\t- 1975\n\t- \"On Evangelization in the Modern World\"\n\t- Pope Paul VI\n\t- a ==‚Äúnew evangelization‚Äù== that links social transformation with the proclamation of the Gospel. In light of many social challenges, he calls for an evangelization that transforms both individual believers and social structures. Evangelization is both personal and social, Paul VI writes, and includes the development and liberation of peoples from oppressive structures that cause famine, disease, and poverty; injustices in trade and economic activities; and the oppression of cultural and political colonialism (the control by stronger countries of weaker ones).\n- **Redemptor Hominis**\n\t- 1979\n\t- \"Redeemer of Man\"\n\t- Pope John Paul II\n\t- ==examines human dignity and rights in the light of the mystery of redemption.== He questions ==consumer attitudes and materialism== (valuing material things more than relationship with God and others) that have become more common. He also questions the adequacy of current economic and political structures to address injustices, noting the degradation of the environment and economic structures that lead to inequality. John Paul II notes the connection between violations of human rights and war and the need for true progress based on respect for these rights.\n- **Laborem Exercens**\n\t- 1981 \n\t- \"Through Work\"\n\t- Pope John Paul II\n\t- ==Work== is the central issue of this document; do women and men participate in God‚Äôs creativity and share in its productivity or are they merely cogs? This poses the idea that ==work should increase human dignity as the economy is made for labour and work is the subject of people.== New concepts of solidarity and ‚Äòindirect employer‚Äô emerge strongly in this encyclical.\n\t- Both ==capitalism and Marxism== are criticised. John Paul had lived through the worst excesses of two regimes (Russian Communism and Nazism) which saw the worker as an expendable resource in the interests of the state. He was highly aware that the exploitation of workers continued, especially in poor areas of the world.\n- **The Challenge of Peace**\n\t- 1983\n\t- pastoral letter from the Catholic bishops of the United States\n\t- offers two Christian responses to war: ==just war and nonviolence.==\n\t- The bishops describe numerous conditions that must be present in order for a ==war to be considered just.==  They bishops condemn the use of nuclear weapons against civilian populations, the deliberate initiation of nuclear warfare, and the arms race, and note that nuclear deterrence is only to be used as a step toward progressive disarmament.  Finally, the bishops call for the Church to be involved in efforts for peace.\n-  **Economic Justice for All**\n\t-  1986\n\t-  In this pastoral letter, the Catholic bishops of the United States call for a ==‚Äúnew American experiment‚Äù== for the common good (no. 295) in order to ==address economic issues related to poverty, employment, food and agriculture, and developing nations==\n\t-  In this pastoral letter, the Catholic bishops of the United States call for a ‚Äúnew American experiment‚Äù for the common good (no. 295) in order to address economic issues related to poverty, employment, food and agriculture, and developing nations\n-  **Sollicitudo Rei Socialis**\n\t-  1987\n\t-  \"The Social Concern of the Church\"\n\t-  Pope John Paul II\n\t-  John Paul who had now been Pope for over fifteen years writes this very thoughtful letter in which the terms ==‚Äòstructures of sin‚Äô and ‚Äòoption for the poor‚Äô strongly emerge (from liberation theology).== He goes onto condemn the gap between the rich and poor which can be partially linked to the arms trade.\n\t-  The ==increase in refugees== is a major concern and a result of confrontation. This was written amongst the continuation of the Cold War with the Berlin Wall collapsing later in 1989. This time also saw the ==severe recession== of the mid 1980‚Äôs and gaps between the rich and poor widening with ‚Äòturbo capitalism‚Äô.\n- **Centesimus Annus**\n\t- 1991\n\t- \"The One Hundredth Year\"\n\t- Pope John Paul II\n\t- ==To affirm democracy the excesses of capitalism must be condemned, as well as the ‚Äòidolatry of the market‚Äô and the ‚Äòinsanity of the arms race‚Äô.== Private property is deemed acceptable but for the first time the world‚Äôs goods (including intellectual property) are stated as having a ‚Äòuniversal destination‚Äô.\n\t- ==The Berlin Wall== had just collapsed; arms expenditure globally hovered at around $1,000 billion (one trillion) and there was also the emergence of the super rich individual.\n- **Evangelium Vitae**\n\t- 1995\n\t- \"The Gospel of Life\"\n\t- Pope John Paul II\n\t- Powerful underscoring of the dignity and value of life; John Paul II condemns the ==‚Äòculture of death‚Äô where individual freedom is placed before the rights of others to life== -hence the condemnation of the death penalty, abortion and euthanasia. With very moving words to women who have undergone abortion; ‚Äòdo not give in to discouragement and do not lose hope‚Äô. This presents positive images of the promotion of a ‚Äòculture of life‚Äô where human freedom finds its authentic meaning and a culture of the family is the ‚Äòsanctuary of life‚Äô.\n\t- John Paul II is clearly anxious about the development of ==individualism and its assertion of rights,== especially in advanced societies.\n- **Dues Caritas Est**\n\t- 2004\n\t- \"God is Love\"\n\t- Pope Benedict XVI\n\t- ==the human person‚Äôs ability to love is rooted in the Father‚Äôs love for humankind and the person‚Äôs identity as created in the image of God.== God‚Äôs love manifests itself in Christ, who gives of himself freely for the salvation of humankind.  The call to love neighbor flows from God‚Äôs love for humanity. Benedict XVI locates love for the poor at the center of Catholic life, noting that the ‚Äúexercise of charity‚Äù is one of the Church‚Äôs three ‚Äúessential activities, along with the administration of the sacraments and the proclamation of the word‚Äù (no. 22).  The Holy Father writes that the Church must form the consciences of the laity so that they can work for a just ordering of society. Their political activity should be lived as ‚Äúsocial charity,‚Äù infused with the light of faith and love (no. 29).\n- **Caritas in Veritate**\n\t- 2009\n\t- \"Charity in Truth\"\n\t- Pope Benedict XVI\n\t- Benedict‚Äôs message is directed at a variety of concerns including ==global poverty, injustice and the arms race.== This looks at individuals and organisations through the lens of charity and truth. ==The individual motivation for charity and the concern for authentic human development== are frequent concerns. There are also strong environmental concerns and the concept of ‚Äòintergenerational justice‚Äô is made.\n\t- This now marked forty years since ==Populorum Progressio ‚Äì ‚ÄúThe Progress of Peoples‚Äù (1967).== ==The global economic and banking crisis of 2008== had a major disproportionate effect on the poor of the world, and the issue of the environment had moved up the agenda as better evidence of degradation was consolidated.\n- **Evangelii Gaudium**\n\t- 2013\n\t- The Joy of the Gospel\n\t- Pope Francis\n\t- While not a papal encyclical, Evangelii Gaudium gives particular attention to the ==‚Äòsocial dimension of Evangelisation‚Äô.== The first section, setting the context for sharing the Joy of the Gospel talks of a huge amount of social problems, characterised by Pope Francis as the ‚Äòcrisis of communal commitment‚Äô and touches on the markets, the economy of exclusion, inner city life, spiritual worldliness and consumerism, among other things.\n\t- Francis wrote this document upon the ==invitation of the fathers of the Synod of Bishops,== and published it in commemoration of the end of the Year of Faith.\n\t- **Laudato Si'**\n\t\t- 2015\n\t\t- On Care for Our Common Home\n\t\t- Pope Francis\n\t\t- ==a passionate call to all people of the world to take ‚Äúswift and unified global action‚Äù, particularly in relation to the destruction of the environment.== Pope Francis writes that while humanity has made incredible progress in science and technology, this has not been matched with moral, ethical and spiritual growth. This imbalance is causing our relationships with creation and with God to break down and our hearts to become hardened to the cry of the earth and the cry of the poor. We become arrogant and neglect creation and everyone that is part of it; forgetting what God has entrusted to our care.\n\t\t- Laudato Si‚Äô is the second encyclical of Pope Francis. Since Lumen fidei was largely the work of Francis‚Äôs predecessor Benedict XVI, Laudato Si‚Äô is generally viewed as the first that truly represents Francis‚Äôs outlook.\n### CST Principles\n#### The Dignity of the Human Person\n1. Give one concrete example of how can this principle of Dignity of the Human Person make a positive change in one of your perspectives, values, or lifestyle habits.\nAs I was growing up, I was often told by my family to be wary of street beggars. They said this was because you never know what they do with the money given to them, which could be buying drugs. This principle of Dignity of the Human Person can positively change my perspective for the better by starting to see these people as children of God too. Why should I automatically judge them?\n### The Common Good\n- \"The common good will not be fully realized, but it provides us with a common goal.\"\n- Three things that working toward common good assumes:\n\t- 1.

While there are a few examples i could think of the one that pops to mind is the example in Yoshikawa's \"Musashi\" novel where the protagonist trys to turn a barren land into farmland at first by failing several times to impose what the farm should look like based on experience only to have his work washed away over and over again by torrential rains, eventually he comes to understand on a deeper level both the landscape, the climate and what he is trying to disclose and he manages to turn the land into a rice plot by working with the natural elements instead of against them. It is my interpretation and belief that this same type of discolsing could theoretically be employed on a larger scale by understanding the realities of the violent climate that we are inheriting and building communities that disclose and amplify the inherent resilience of mother nature.\n\u003e We managed to change the climate of an entire planet on ACCIDENT, imagine what we could do with the right INTENTION\n### Ramon\n- connectivity is a human right? tech \u003e other needs?\n- surveillance capitalism\n- is the free gift that is FB reciprocated by the tons of data users provide\n- crucking: to cheat, deceive, defraud\n- https://monthlyreview.org/2014/07/01/surveillance-capitalism/\n### Sasha\n- Poetry is technology\n- \"A poem\"\n- Christian Bok, robopoetics\n- http://ubu-mirror.ch/papers/object/03_bok.\n\u003e It can just be me, but thinking of the end goal and benefit of teaching poetry to AI reduces the practice itself to what Iain said about treating technology without respect and only as a means to optimize human functions.

Start of the year, we had to face a volcano eruption and a global pandemic; now, we've had to deal with political unrest and extreme typhoons. Sprinkle in all the celebrity deaths, and you've got yourself the penultimate VUCA year.\n\nHowever, 2020 has also made me into a better person, personally and professionally (e.g. new careers/ventures, confronting issues). I wouldn't have been able to grow as much if it wasn't for the VUCA world I was living in. With the right mindset, I believe we can turn every crisis into an opportunity. \n\nThat's why I'm glad I got to hear of the VUCA framework, because I believe it's a step towards making a better world. Most of the crisis we've dealt with were because of lack of mindfulness (Hi Duterte, where's the emergency budget!). If we were more prepared, we could've mitigated the effects of 2020. But now that we've experienced the brunt of it, I'm hoping we can learn from our mistakes, and act for our future.\n\n--- \n\n- **Foresight:** the ability to predict what can potentially happen in the future.\n\t- In practicing Foresight, ==we subscribe to the idea that the future is not something we wait for to happen.== Yes, time is not something we control and \"tomorrow\" always becomes \"today\" but ==how that looks like is something we have control over.== We use the tools and skills to shape the future we imagine and create specific steps on how to prepare for whatever is to come.\n\t- Tools:\n\t\t- STEEP Analysis\n\t\t- Futures Triangle\n\t\t- Causal Layered Analysis\n\t- Creativity and foresight are both very practical skills we need as we move into the inevitable Fourth Industrial Revolution.\n\t\t\u003e According to an article written by World Economic Forum in 2016 (Links to an external site.), the Fourth Industrial Revolution should be greatly felt by this year. Admittedly, it's always tricky to think about very technologically advanced concepts/futures/times from the perspective of a developing nation. But this is happening very fast even if the world had to slow down this year. In the Fourth Industrial Revolution, we have to intentionally think about the role and agency of humans in a world where AI and robotics are more likely to be the norm. However, these are not the only things that this new age will bring. ==The challenge for us is to course our definition and production of creativity and innovation towards a more equitable and sustainable space for all.== \n\t- aA\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khjY5LWF3tg\u0026feature=emb_title\n\n![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20201208143232.png]]\n\n- Supplementary readings:\n\t- [The Future of Human Work Is Imagination, Creativity, and Strategy](https://hbr.org/2018/01/the-future-of-human-work-is-imagination-creativity-and-strategy)\n\t- [Jobs lost, jobs gained: What the future of work will mean for jobs, skills, and wages](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/future-of-work/jobs-lost-jobs-gained-what-the-future-of-work-will-mean-for-jobs-skills-and-wages#)\n\n#### Tools\n##### Futures Triangle\n- The Futures Triangle, a tool developed by Sohail Inayatullah, is a framework that helps us define a plausible future by defining three parameters: ==the Pull of the future, Weight of history, and the push of the present.== This sets clearer parameters about the plausible future of anything (i.e. Future of Jobs or Future of Education) because it contextualizes creativity and innovation as ==functions of time and space.==\n- **Plausible Future:** a plausible future is a convincing description of a future, which we can hold true, even though this future itself can be factually fallacious. \n\t- https://cspo.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/read_van-der-Helm-Towards-a-Clarification-of-Probability.pdf\n- **Important questions**\n\t- The Pull of the Future\n\t\t- What would be the ideal future for this issue or topic?\n\t\t- Do we have a shared vision of the preferred future and of the futures we want to avoid?\n\t\t- Do we have a shared image of the logic behind how the future gets formed in this specific case, or are there competing logical beliefs?\n\t\t- If we were adrift in a river, where do we end up in the issue?\n\t\t- What tools and resources do we have that can affect the direction and lead us towards that future?\n\t\t- What do we lack to influence change? What are our limits?\n\t\t- Is it possible to impact the futures? Or is it needed at all?\n\t- The Push of the Present\n\t\t- What trends and technologies are changing the future right now?\n\t\t- What things are pushing change forward?\n\t\t- What already known new policies, procedures, laws, budgets, decisions and technologies will start to push changes forward in the near future?\n\t- The Weight of the Past\n\t\t- Who benefits from the status quo or loses if it is changed?\n\t\t- What are the barriers to change?\n\t\t- What is holding us back, or getting in our way?\n\t\t- What are the deep structures that resist change?\n- **How it works:** ==brainstorming tool==\n\t- Select a topic or issue to research and speculate on.

Aspects within society such as family, friends, colleagues, neighbors and the media\n\t-  Technological: New technologies, technology effects, research, development speed, new products and processes, product lifecycles, technology investments, and government research expenditure\n\t-  Economic: Economic growth, inflation, interest rates, exchange rates, taxation, unemployment, income, business cycles, world trade and resource availability\n\t-  Environmental: Material, resources, disposal, emission regulations, energy, transport routes, life cycles, effects of the ozone hole and global warming\n\t-  Political: Policy frameworks, labor market policies, government policies, competition oversight, legislation, political stability, tax policies, trade barriers, security requirements and subsidies\n-  **How this works**\n\t-  Identify your central issue/ topic/ concept (i.e. Future of Schools)\n\t-  Define how each STEEP Category looks like in relation to your central idea.\n\t\t-  For example, the Sociological Analysis of the future of school can look like this (especially in the context of where we are today):\n\t\t\t-  Physical space is no longer necessary, people don't necessarily all live at the same place with the same timezone. Population can grow big because classes are no longer necessarily tied to a classroom. The teacher-student relationship has now shifted because teachers don't have to be present only during class time.\n\t\t- This is basically how it goes -- you extrapolate from the current realities and describe how that category could look like\n\t- Keep going until you've described all your categories.\n\t- Develop/ideate possibilities and innovations specific to your central idea based on your analysis.\n\n![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20201208150506.png]]\n\n##### Causal Layered Analysis\n- Causal Layered Analysis (CLA) is a Post-structuralist Futures tool developed by Dr. Sohail Inayatullah. This method works by ==identifying many different levels, and attempting to make synchronized changes at all levels== to create a coherent new future.\n- The CLA has 4 layers: ==Litany, Causes, World View, and Myth/Metaphor.==\n\t- Litany: The surface level description of an issue.\n\t\t- Events\n\t\t- Trends\n\t\t- Problems\n\t\t- ‚ÄúWord on the street‚Äù\n\t\t- Media Spin\n\t\t- Official Positions\n\t- Causes: The systems and structures that perpetuate the litany.\n\t\t- Structures\n\t\t- Inter-Relationships\n\t\t- Systems\n\t\t- Policy analysis/technical explanations/ role of the state and interest groups\n\t- World View: The values and perspectives that uphold the systems.\n\t\t- Culture\n\t\t- Values\n\t\t- How language frames/constrains the issue\n\t- Myth/Metaphor: Immediate visual imagery associated to the litany.\n\t\t- Collective Archetypes\n\t\t- Gut/emotional responses\n\t\t- Visual images\n-  Sources\n\t-  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWwDmp1yY5A\u0026feature=emb_title\n\t-  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImWDmFPfifI\n\n\u003e The CLA is an interesting tool because it show us how the things and issues we see today go beyond the surface level. In fact, a lot of the problems and opportunities we see today did not come from nothing -- ==these are products of the history of mankind.== All of the things we encounter today are rooted to and potentially upheld by myths and metaphors we may unconsciously use to define how we perceive the world. \n\u003e Using the CLA can help us ground our brainstorming process. Whether we're looking for solutions to problems or searching for ways to innovate on anything, we can use this framework to see why the things are the way they are and how we can flip things back to arrive at solutions or concepts that can also be supported by what we already know.\n\n--- \n### A Plausible Future\nIn this exercise, we will be using the Futures Triangle to understand a Plausible future for the central idea you are most curious about. Here's the task:\n\n- Identify the task (i.e. Future of Dining In)\n- Do a quick research on each of the triangle pillars of the Futures Triangle as it relates to your central idea\n- Propose a plausible future for your central idea. This can be in the form of a narrative, bullet points, illustration, video, or podcast. Whatever makes most sense for you.\n\n**FUTURE OF LEARNING**\n- Pillars \n\t- The Pull of the Future\n\t\t- ideal future: learning is decentralized and democratized\n\t\t- futures we want to avoid: a world where information and knowledge is for the select few\n\t\t- how this future gets formed: innovation that informs and inspires people, instead of complicating and obfuscating them. \n\t\t- this can also be used for manipluation\n\t\t- tools and resources we have: products and education. not just those in edtech, but tech in general\n\t\t- what we lack: coorindation. imagine what all these companies could do together instead of pursing their individual goals\n\t- The Push of the Present\n\t\t- trends \u0026 technologies: tech! esp edtech platforms, when everything went online. creator economy also\n\t\t- innovative startup act;  local accelerators and startups in this field (e.g. Kumu)\n\t\t- emerging startup ecosystems\n\t- The Weight of the Past\n\t\t- who benefits from the status quo: those who have money to afford \"elite education\" \n\t\t- barriers/holding us back/structures: profit over purpose; financial maximization value\n- Plausible Future\n\t- A world of embedded education: the practice of educating people through encounters that they already have with systems that exist primarily for non-educational purposes\n\t- thriving creator economy, for education\n\t- more alternate forms of learning: e.g. bootcamps, online courses, become normal. people become more open to them\n- Sources\n\t- https://fakepixels.substack.com/p/fkpxls-special-volume-embedded-education","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.723605439Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2020-12-15":{"title":"2020-12-15","content":"\n# December 15, 2020\n## Theo\n#religion\n### Justice in Scriptures\n- The Conversion of St. Augustine\n- God's Special Revelation in Scripture\n\u003e As one of the special ways in which God reveals himself, ==Scripture== is considered as one of the 4 sources of doing theology, the other 3 being ==Tradition== (which, together with Scripture, form one deposit of Divine Revelation), ==Experience== (which we identified in Module 1 as the starting point of theology and of the Pastoral Circle), and ==Reasoning== (which uses the contributions of philosophy, social sciences, and other disciplines, including their insights on Social Analysis which we consider as the 2nd step of the Pastoral Circle method in Module 1). \n- **Overview of Justice**\n- **Creation**\nNormal\n\u003e On one hand, the insertion of the 1st story of creation, one of the last to be composed, at the beginning of the entire Bible introduces the themes of divine concern for creatures, the dignity of human beings, and the orderly division of creation into different habitats for different creatures, different times for different activities, and the importance of honoring God (during the 7th day or Sabbath day) in difficult times as well as moments of celebration.\n\u003e On the other hand, the 2nd creation story highlights the importance of relationships: God makes all the other creatures in an effort to provide a suitable companion for the human (v. 18). Only another human can offer that companionship, which finds its ultimate expression in marriage. \n\nTheologican\n\u003e At the beginning of the video, Bishop Barron answers the question, \"Why does God create?\" by quoting Vatican I's answer, ==\". . . so as to manifest and share his glory.\" ==\n\u003e However, in the video below, theology professor Fr. Michael Himes, makes an interesting clarification on this answer by Vatican I and suggests a more satisfying answer which is worth listening to and reflecting upon. As you watch, take note of the theological shorthand for that reality which brings the universe into existence.\n- Our Responsibility as \"Images of God\"\n\u003e In this final video related to Creation, let us reflect on our responsibility as people created in the \"image of God,\" a theme that runs throughout the bible, culminating in Jesus Christ as our model of being new human, the one who exemplifies to us what it truly means to be an \"image of God.\"  ==We are called to be a sign and instrument of God‚Äôs love, as individuals, and as a community of persons. We are called to reflect the perfect community of the Trinity in our social relationships.==\n\n![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20201215233709.png]]\n\n1. What specific theological view or religious truth conveyed by the 2 stories of creation in Genesis strike you the most?\n3. How does this view/truth broaden my perspective about the nature of justice and the nature of God and all his creation in general?\n\nThe religious truth that struck me the most was that science/philosophy and religion go together. This is because of the assumption that most religious people are unscientific (e.g. vouching for Creation over Big Bang theory). This view broadens my perspective by making me realize that believing in God doesn't necessarily mean you have to restrict your world view. You can help contribute to the world through scientific/philosophical means (we are co-creators after all) while still believing in God.\n\n### Original Sin\n1.  Why is there sin and evil in the world?\nThe Bible teaches that sin and evil come not from God who created everything good, but from the willful disobedience of man who abused his God-given freedom at the dawn of history.\n2. What does ‚Äúoriginal sin‚Äù mean?\n‚ÄúOriginal sin‚Äù can refer to two things:\n‚Ä¢the first ‚Äúoriginating sin‚Äù which brought evil and brokenness into the world; or \n‚Ä¢‚Äúoriginated sin,‚Äù or the actual sinful state into which we are born, the essence of which is the privation of sanctifying grace, and some of whose consequences are evident in the outside  sinful  situation (sin of  the  world),  and  the inner  effect  of  disordered  desires (concupiscence) we all experience within us.\n3. What does Genesis teach about original sin? \nGenesis narrates the primordial account of the ‚Äúoriginating sin‚Äù of Adam and Eve and its consequences for them as well as in the spread of evil in order to account for the evil which we all experience today.\n\n4. What were the practical consequences of the first sin?\nFrom the Genesis narrative, in rebelling against God, the man and the woman destroyed their original harmony with:\n- each other (‚Äúthey realized they were naked‚Äù),\n- others (Cain murdered his brother Abel),\n- the community (Tower of Babel),\n- nature (‚Äúcursed be the ground‚Ä¶‚Äù),\nand incurred death (‚Äúdirt you are and to dirt you shall return‚Äù).\n5. What does Genesis add to many contemporary solutions to our social problems?\nTo today's social science approach to bringing peace, justice, and improved economic conditions, Genesis adds a serious consideration of the presence of SIN, and the ‚Äúconsequent monumental struggle against the powers of darkness which pervades our whole human history‚Äù (GS 37).\nPut simply , effective programs for improving social conditions must face and work to overcome the deeper causes of social evils: our wounded human nature, our inclination to self-centeredness, which Genesis reveals.\n6. What is the connection between original sin and death?\nThe science behind sin - The Boston Globe\nDeath as we know it -  the ultimate test of our lives, shrouded in mystery and thus often a source of deep fear and dread -  is due to sin, not God's intention.  God did not make death nor does he rejoice in the destruction of the living‚Äù Wis. 1:13-14. But with St. Paul, we hold that ‚ÄúChrist won the victory when he rose to life, for by his death he freed us from death‚Äù (1 Cor 15:57; GS 18).\n7. How does Church teaching explain original sin? \nThe Church clarifies that we do not inherit Adam‚Äôs personal sin, but its consequences, that is that as members of the human race, we are born deprived of sanctifying grace, into the sinful condition in the world with our weakened human nature resulting from his sin.\n8. What is meant by ‚Äúconcupiscence‚Äù?\nConcupiscence is that deep-seated disorder in our appetites and drives that is the root-cause of many of our personal and social sins; through God‚Äôs redeeming grace we are strengthened to overcome this disorder within us.\n9. What is meant by ‚Äúcapital sins‚Äù?\nCapital or ‚Äúroot sins‚Äù are basic evil inclinations or disvalues (pride, lust, anger, gluttony, envy, covetousness, sloth) which are the origin of many sinful thoughts, words or deeds. They manifest the evil tendencies within each of us which are the effect of original sin.\n10. How does Baptism ‚Äútake away original sin‚Äù?\nBaptism ‚Äútakes away original sin‚Äù by bringing to the baptized the gift of the Holy Spirit, God‚Äôs saving, sanctifying presence. \n\nThe indwelling Holy Spirit in the baptized makes them adopted sons/daughters of the Father, coheirs with Jesus Christ, and incorporates them into his Body the Church.\n\n-----\n\n1. Which biblical event/passage we have covered so far inspires you the most to be just and help create a more just society? Why?\n\n2. How can you apply this passage in your own life and bring about a positive change in your  perspectives, values, or lifestyle.\n\nA biblical event/passage that's definitely inspired me to practice justice is Jesus' sacrifice: taking the wound of humanity just to heal us. It's the most selfless thing I can think of; imagine helping those who hurt you. That's really justice at work. I want to apply this to my own life by practicing this with other people. \"Do unto others what you want done unto you\". E.G. Being gracious with others even if they aren't. Don't treat people the way you're treated. Treat people the way you want to be treated.\n\n--- \n1. Currently, I feel like I am living self-centeredly. My treasure (money) is usually spent on impulse purchases for myself; I donate, but not as much as I have before. Since money is my top priority (worry for finances), this has led me to spending my time and talent in work, even if this detriments me.  \n2. The specific strategies I can use to allot more of my time, talent and treasure to help uplift the lives and conditions of the poor and marginalized are time-blocking, weekly reviews, and budgeting. These all make use of reflection and planning, which can help me be more mindful. By being more mindful, I can allot more of my time, talent, and treasure to those in need.\n3. My immersion sector is PDL: persons deprived of liberty, a.k.a. prisoners. These people may have done personal sins like theft, murder, etc. that landed them in jail. However, there are also social sins like police violence and corruption. On one end of the spectrum, this manifests as innocent people becoming prisoners due to being accused of drug peddling (knowing how Duterte is very anti-drugs). On the other hand, this manifests as unjust alliances between inmates and jail guards through bribery.\n4. These social sins create an environment encouraging personal sins. Thus, they reinforce each other. It becomes an endless cycle of sin.\n5. I believe these social sins can be replaced with life-giving structures by overhauling prisons to encourage rehabilitation over punishment. This in line with the Christian belief that all of us have value, being made in God's image. By treating PDL with the respect they deserve, we can breathe life into a sinful place.","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.723605439Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2020-12-18":{"title":"2020-12-18","content":"\n# December 18, 2020\n## IDS\n[[Sources/Interdisciplinary Approaches to Creation \u0026 Innovation - Class]]\n### Creativity as Revision\n#innovation #creativity \n\n\u003e In the first module, we established how it is a ==natural inclination of all us humans to be creative.== Chapters from The Runaway Species: How Human Creativity Remakes the World and related YouTube videos featuring the book‚Äôs authors helped us appreciate this.\n\n\u003e In the second module, we established that ==creativity is contextualized and that it is bound by space and time.== Tools like STEEP analysis, Futures Triangle, and causal layered analysis equip us with frameworks that allow us to take a subject, object, or phenomenon of interest and identify all the factors that contributed to their coming into fruition, while allowing us to also project into the future and anticipate forthcoming realities.\n\n\u003e In this third module, we will establish that ==creativity is a process of revision.== From this assertion, we can proceed analytically (ie, we can trace back what current realities are an evolution of), and we can also proceed in terms of actualizing the process of creativity (ie, practicing creativity by revising an existing reality).\n\n--- \n### Bending as a mode of revision \n- Bending is a mode of revision that alters the shape and nature of something.

The Fortified Self\n\t- \"I sit with all possible versions of myself\"\n- \"too weird or difficult to proceed towards the sawmill\"\n- Manifest Dismantling: our current notions of productivity aren't creative, but destructive\n- Capitalism appropriating everything\n- Appropriating myself; individualistic part of me selling off everything else\n\u003e ‚ÄúIn a situation where every waking moment has become the time in which we make our living, and when we submit even our leisure for numerical evaluation via likes on Facebook and Instagram, constantly checking on its performance like one checks a stock, monitoring the ongoing development of our personal brand, time becomes an economic resource that we can no longer justify spending on =='nothing.'== It provides no return on investment; ==it is simply too expensive.== This is a cruel confluence of time and space: just as we lose noncommercial spaces, we also see all of our own time and our actions as potentially commercial.‚Äù\n\n\u003e _‚ÄúI hear, see, and smell things in a world where others also hear, see, and smell me. And it takes a break to remember that: a break to do nothing, to just listen, to remember in the deepest sense ==what, when, and where we are.==\n\u003e I want to be clear that I‚Äôm not actually encouraging anyone to stop doing things completely. In fact, I think that ‚Äúdoing nothing‚Äù‚Äîin the sense of refusing productivity and stopping to listen‚Äî==**entails an active process of listening that seeks out the effects of racial, environmental, and economic injustice and brings about real change.** ==I consider ‚Äúdoing nothing‚Äù both as a kind of deprogramming device and as sustenance for those feeling too disassembled to act meaningfully.‚Äù\n\n[[Cards/Doing nothing is active listening]]\n\n^^^ omg put in Cathexis\n\n\u003e _‚ÄúIn such times as these, ==having recourse to periods of and spaces for ‚Äúdoing nothing‚Äù is of utmost importance, because without them we have no way to think, reflect, heal, and sustain ourselves‚Äîindividually or collectively. ==There is a kind of nothing that‚Äôs necessary for, at the end of the day, doing something. When overstimulation has become a fact of life, I suggest that we reimagine #FOMO as #NOMO, the necessity of missing out, or if that bothers you, #NOSMO, the necessity of sometimes missing out.‚Äù_\n\n[[Cards/Doing nothing is self-care]]\n\n\u003e \"...'To hear is the physical means that enables perception. To listen is to give attention to what is perceived both acoustically and psychologically.' ==The goal and the reward of [[Cards/Deep Listening]] was a heightened sense of receptivity and a reversal of our usual cultural training, which teaches us to quickly analyze and judge more than to simply observe.==\n\u003e When I learned about Deep Listening, I realized I had unwittingly been practicing it for a while‚Äîonly in the context of bird-watching. In fact, I‚Äôve always found it funny that it‚Äôs called bird-watching, because half if not more of ==bird-watching is actually bird-listening. (I personally think they should just rename it ‚Äúbird-noticing.‚Äù)== However you refer to it, what this practice has in common with Deep Listening is that observing birds requires you quite literally to do nothing. Bird-watching is the opposite of looking something up online. You can‚Äôt really look for birds; you can‚Äôt make a bird come out and identify itself to you. The most you can do is walk quietly and wait until you hear something, and then stand motionless under a tree, using your animal senses to figure out where and what it is.‚Äù\n\n\n#### Against Creativity\n\u003e *_‚Äú...individualization is a key factor in the contemporary rhetoric of creativity. But the rhetoric demands even more; you have to be a particular ==kind== of individual. Too often it is white, middle-class, straight, fully abled men that are creative and innovative, and all other forms of minority identity are further marginalized.‚Äù_*\n\n\u003e _‚ÄúWhat we see on our social media feeds, the songs we listen to, the information we are presented with, the news sites we visit, the people we meet and the emotions we feel are all beginning to be determined by coded algorithms. While they can bring new things into our consumption patterns (‚Äòyou listen to X, have you heard Y?‚Äô), such creativity serves only to keep us consuming. It is newness to maintain more of the same.‚Äù_\n\n[[Cards/Creativity enables consumerism]]\n\n\u003e ‚ÄúIf creativity is about the power to create something from nothing, then believing in impossible things is its most critical component. We need to believe that impossible worlds can be reached, if these impossibilities can ever be realized and become lived experiences.‚Äù\n\n[[Cards/To create something from nothing, we must believe in the impossible]]\n\n\u003e **_‚ÄúThe ‚Äòcreativity‚Äô inherent in politics is more about holding on to power, rather than thinking of new ways of tackling common injustices._**  \n\u003e _This brand of politics has created governments that have systematically failed to stop ‚Äì and in some cases, catalysed ‚Äì inequality, global poverty, environmental degradation and the threat of global nuclear annihilation. As such, people are taking it upon themselves to manage and create new political institutions. If the Arab Spring and the Occupy movement have taught us anything, it‚Äôs that post-2008, political structures are fragile.‚Äù_\n\n\u003e ‚ÄúTo be ==radically creative== is to see connections and potential ways of augmenting each path of resistance with the other. To ==collaborate in opposition== is not easy and requires an agonistic mind set of patience, forgiveness, self-restraint and a great deal of emotional energy. Such things are in very short supply in the current suffocating environment of urban capitalism.‚Äù\n\n#### What are we resisting against?\n1. **The definition of a \"creative\"**\n\t1. Boo stereotypes boo tech bros\n\t2. Being \"creative\" today = trying to fit in a mold, looking and speaking the part\n\t3. Does this mean people who don't fit the mold are less creative?\n\t4. Questions to think about: Who sets the rhetoric? Who defines the parameters? How much agency and power do we yield as privileged citizens of a developing nation? What's our role in defining this identity as we build our own?\n2. **We need to resist the notion that to be creative is to constantly grow and be productive.**\n\t1. We live in a world where everything is commoditized, including time\n\t2. How do we navigate a world where the primary identity of everyone is defined by their level of productivity?\n\t3. Have a \"place of nothingness\", a source of grounding. Have moments of nothing.\n3. **Falling prey to our \"infinite appetite for distractions.\"**\n\t1.

Direct mapping from ownership structure -\u003e DAO structuring. **First example of NFTs as keys.**\n\n\u003e The first obvious key unlock, is the purchase ==unlocking the marketplace of that collection. ==\n\n\u003e This was quickly followed up by remedying the sense of ‚Äúwhere lambo sir‚Äù -\u003e ==communities.== Verify you have this NFT in your wallet, unlock the Discord.\n\n\u003e the problem is that these unlocks are hardlyyyyy touching the chain. The medium itself‚Ä¶\n\n**Blitmap:** taking a step beyond using generative art on-chain as the basis for new mints -\u003e was creating a mechanism for the creation of the keys themselves.\n\n+ a group of artists created 100 original pixel art pieces\n+ once those were minted you were able to pick a base + a palette, from the original pieces\n+ in combining those you minted ‚Äúa sibling‚Äù, a remix of a piece you owned and the original creators received a split of that mint\n+ with a total collection of 1600 pieces, all community made on-chain\n\n\u003e ==Humans are obsessed with being part of the creation process.== It‚Äôs just how we are wired. It drives so many acts, as silly as looking through the window cutouts at construction sites to sex.\n\u003e This on-chain mechanism for a community to craft their own keys is as simple and human as it gets. \n\n\u003e If you‚Äôre thinking about NFT‚Äôs right now (from a business perspective, if you‚Äôre vibing off of 1:1‚Äôs or gifting to friends much love to you), you have to be thinking about (no pun intended) ==the chain of interactions you believe the object is helping to unlock.==\n\n\u003e John and I have jammed on a creation of an NFT game where your purchase of the NFT allows you to enter the world. Death in that world strips you of the NFT and forces a sale.

You don‚Äôt look over at someone else‚Äôs race and think, I‚Äôm doing a bad job because you‚Äôre going faster. ==You just focus on your own pace.==\n\n\u003e I have a friend whose communication style I really admire: she‚Äôs clear, emotionally honest, and sets great boundaries. My hope is to be like that in every important emotional encounter: ==to express my needs clearly, to be as honest as possible, and to make it clear what‚Äôs okay and what isn‚Äôt.== This is incredibly freeing, because it means ==I judge myself by my own standard of behavior in every relationship, and not by the other person‚Äôs response.== \n\n\u003e I‚Äôve noticed that most people seem to overly fixate on other people‚Äôs responses: i.e. my partner is upset at me, so I must have been a bad girlfriend. She didn‚Äôt want to go on another date, so I must have been super boring and said the wrong thing. I had a fight with my friend and they‚Äôve been ignoring me since, so I must have overestimated our intimacy...if you want to calibrate accurately, you have to center your own behavior. How did you act? ==If you have no way to judge that‚Äôs not based on obsessively analyzing other people‚Äôs micro-reactions to you, you probably don‚Äôt know who you are in the absence of someone else‚Äôs verdict.==\n\n\u003e ==If you‚Äôre forever looking around for validation, you‚Äôll never be able to make anything that‚Äôs completely your own. Because you don‚Äôt even know what you think.== You don‚Äôt know what is good and beautiful outside of what is culturally dictated to be good and beautiful. We believe that desire is mimetic, but we forget that the people who inspire real desire are always people who are redefining it‚Äîwho give us something new to look at, allow us to escape groupthink. There‚Äôs nothing more powerful than separating signal from noise, spotting a phenomenon no one else has recognized yet. But to do that ==you need your own separate thoughts.==\n\n### feelings first\n\u003e I was going to start this off by telling you an anecdote about my dad. Last weekend my uncle told me that he was struggling to switch from freshwater fishing to saltwater fishing, and wished my dad was still living in Vancouver so he could help out. \"Your dad,‚Äù he said, \"would research everything meticulously, come up with a bunch of theories on how to solve the problem, and then make us test out all his ideas one by one. He‚Äôs great at mapping things out.‚Äù I wanted to use this anecdote to explain where I get ==my need to intellectualize==‚ÄîI‚Äôm just like my dad in that having all the information soothes me like nothing else. But then I realized I‚Äôm just doing the same thing I always do: trying to explain it all away. Developmental psychology, attachment theory, Jungian shadow work‚Äîanything to make it make sense. ==I‚Äôm happiest when I can present a theory, and say here, now I understand.==\n\n\u003e But our feelings point to ==our values and our sensitivities, our pasts and our dreams.== My terror of gaining weight said something meaningful about my relationship with my body, my need to be conventionally attractive. My inability to confront anyone was the result of my deep-seated desire to please. ==Even when emotions don‚Äôt ‚Äúmake sense,‚Äù they have value.==\n\n\u003e ==The personal is political==: our perspectives on the world are first and foremost shaped by our emotional experiences.

Using insights from this module (poverty, inequality, consumerism, the doughnut economics), describe in 3-5 paragraphs your sustainable development plan for the city/municipality you call your home (identify the place in your answer).\n\nI've lived in Las Pinas my whole life, and I know it to be a very polluted and congested place. As an example, here are some of my memories: being afraid to cross the street during traffic, and holding my breath to avoid smelling car smoke and sidewalk litter. I acknowledge that I have a lot of privilege, which means that I can afford to have securing housing and ride private transportation. If going outside is already a terrible experience for me, how about those who have to take public transportation or sleep on the streets?\n\nWhat would I do if I was responsible for my city's sustainable development plan? I would towards creating a greener city. Think more trees, trashcans, and improved public infrastructure (e.g. more pedestrian + biker sidewalks). This vision can be implemented by tackling topics like education, housing, and income + work.

We tend to forget that ==these representations are actually concrete things that affect lives and livelihoods==, and that ==the story of development is about the world and the people that live in it.==\n\u003e \n\u003e Please remember that ==there is a story behind every number that appears in a metric.== Our goal is to ==build a humane world by understanding it in the most nuanced way possible==, even if that sometimes means we have to express this understanding in a simple model.\n\nAmong the different metrics mentioned in this module, which ones appeal to you the most? How do they measure development? How can these parameters express problems in society? Which ones might best apply to methodologies related to your sector in NSTP (the respective institutions you're working with in Tubigon, Bohol or Rizal)? What statistics and indicators do you think are important to pay attention to as we discuss sustainable development?\n\n\nFor my group's partner organization, Yamang-dagat Angkop sa Kababaihan at Pang-kabuhayan Inc. (YAKAP), I believe the most appropriate metric to be the \"Capabilities Approach\" by Amartya Sen. According to him, economic freedom should be focused on developing the capabilties of those in need (i.e. marginalized citizens of developing countries). I love this model because it prioritizes increasing freedom over productivity, making it more humane. Since YAKAP is focused on women's livelihood, this approach can be applied through providing education. Being more educated enables them to have more personal freedom.","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.723605439Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2021-09-21":{"title":"2021-09-21","content":"## PHILO13\n#philosophy \n\u003e \"The unexamined life is not worth living\"\n\nRelated to [[Sources/This is Water - Speech]]\n### The goal of ethics\n**Ethics is the quest for the good life.**\n+ A life of excellence is a life of virtue.\n+ Not simply to be pursue excellence or the good life, but to 'take care' or 'be careful' (epimeleisthai)\n### Platonic Moral Theory\n+ **Doctrine of teleology:** everything in the universe has a purpose/function within a hierarchy of purposes/functions.\n\t+ Humans also have a purpose/function, and\n+ **Theory of forms:** there is a world of forms where the eternal and perfect models of the things in the world exist.\n\n### Theory of the Soul\n*The soul existed prior to its union with the body.*\nThe soul is composed of two main aprts:\n+ the rational (reason)\n+ the irrational (spirit and appetite)\n\n### Tripartite Nature of the Soul\nThe soul performs three functions. To each function corresponds a power in the soul.\n+ Reason: awareness of a goal\n+ Spirit: drive towards action\n+ Appetite: appetite for bodily things\n\n### Pre-Existent State of the Soul\nThe soul enjoyed a basic harmony between its rational and irrational parts -- a harmony wherin reason controlled the spirit and appetites through its knowledge of the truth.\nThe reaason could suggest a goal for behavior only to be overcome by sensual appetite, and the power of the spirit could be pulled in eitehr direction by these sensual desires.\n\n### Analogy of the Charioteer\nThe condition of the man may be likened to the charioteer driving two horses. One horse is good, another is bad. \nThough the charioteer has a clear vision of where to go and the good horse is on course, the bad horse misbehaves...\n\n### The Three Faculties\n\n1. **Temperance**: moderation. appetites kept within limits and in their measure. The art of living requires knowledge of limits and of measure.\n\t1. applies to appetite\n2. **Courage**: when the energy of will (from the spirit) is kept within limits avoiding rash action, and becomes a trustworthy power in aggressive and defensive behavior\n\t1. applies to spirit\n3. **Wisdom**: when reason remains undisturbed by the onrush of appetites and continues to see the true ideals in spite of the constant changes experienced in the daily life\n\t1. applies to reason\n\n\nThe harmony of three faculties constitutes *justice*, the overarching virtue.\n\nLiving the good life requires reining in your passions.\nFreedom outside of a well-ordered community is *lawlessness.*\n\n### Morality as Recovery of Lost Harmony\n*Only knowledge can produce virtue while ignorance/false knowledge produces evil*\n\n### Moral Evil\nEvil or vice is caused by ignorance/false knowledge when the passions influence reasons to think what appears to bring happiness will do so and cannot.\n+ **Ignorance:** when people are ignorant, their personalities are disorganized because unruly desires/passions control them\n+ **Knowledge:** when people truly know what is good, they will do what is really good\n\t+ False knowledge must be replaced with an accurate appraisal of things or acts and their values...**Awakening**\n\nJustice isn't just political. It's about *soul*.\n### Meaning of Virtue\n+ **Virtue means *knowledge.***\n+ **Virtue is the fulfillment of a unique function.**\n+ **Virtue is *grounded in the nature of the soul.***\n\n+ Virtue is attained only when each part of the soul is fulfilling its own function\n\t+ The appetites and the spirit must be subject to the sovereignty of reason\n\t+ This directs and orders the dynamic capcities according to wisdom\n\n### Twofold Aspects of Man\n+ **non-rational**\n+ **rational**\n\nThe rational aspect is more truly ourselves. We can identify with it rather than with the non-rational aspect, and can recognize that this is appropriate for the kind of being that we are.\n\n### The Ring of Gyges\nThere was a shepherd who was feeding his flock in a fieled when an earthquake happened. After the quake, he saw an opening in the Earth. \nHe went inside and found a bronze horse containing a corpse who was wearing a golden ring. The shepherd took the ring and placed it on his finger.\nHe discovered that the ring gave him the power to become invisible. He then arranged to be chosen as one of the messengers who reported to the king as to the status of the flocks.\nArriving at the palace, he used his new power of invisibility to seduce the queen and murder the king. He then became king of Lydia himself.\n**If there were two such magic rings and the just put on one of them and the unjust the othjer, ==both will behave in the same unjust way.==**\n\n\u003e \"No man can be imagined to be of such an iron nature that he would stand fast in justice.\"\n\nNo man would keep his hands off what was not his own when he could safely take what he liked and in all respects be like a god among men.\n\nA man is just, not willingly or because he thinks that justice is any good to him individually, but of necessity, ==for if anyone thinks that he can safely be unjust, he will be unjust.==\n\nTrue justice pertains more to the true self \"being concerned not with the outward man, but with the inward...==for the just man...sets in order his own inner life...is his own master and his own law, and at peace with himself.==\"\n\nJustice in the end is far nobler than injustice for it serves the telos of man. The end of man is attained when his higher powers are perceived.","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.723605439Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2021-09-27":{"title":"2021-09-27","content":"## WiTech\n1.  For an introduction, please tell us a bit about yourself!\n\nHi! I'm Bianca Aguilar, a junior studying Information Design and Computer Science in Ateneo de Manila University. As a designer and educator, I'm dedicated to cultivating creatives and technologists to be both builders *and* thinkers. I do this by creating learning experiences and writing critical pieces on tech \u0026 design with communities like Developh, User Experience Society, and Reboot. I also do product design and no-code web development for early-stage startups and VC funds. When I'm not working on all this, you can find me training in my home dance studio!\n\n2.  What was your first introduction to technology, and what got you hooked?\n\nAs an artist, I've always found comfort in creating in the web, from animating my own stories to drawing my own characters. Then, when basic HTML + CSS was introduced to me in high school, I found myself wanting more. I ended up teaching myself how to code my own websites from scratch, no matter how ugly they were. I later came across product design during the start of my college; since then, I've constantly been designing and developing. It's also thanks to communities like Developh and User Experience Society that I was able to nurture this passion for creation.\n\nI got hooked on technology because it was so *engaging*. I always find myself challenged, whether it's learning new methods or fixing bugs. The satisfaction you get from figuring something out is like nothing else! At the same time, I was able to indulge in my creativity; the browser became my new canvas. With technology, I felt like I could create anything. \n\n3.  What are your most prized accomplishments in technology?\n\n+ I still can't believe that I was able to become an Adobe Design Circle Scholar this year. The fact that I was chosen to be one of the 10 scholars from thousands of entries over the world is so surreal!\n+ This year, I was able to write two essays that critiqued complex social issues in technology: Make Space for Maintenance, which examines the exploitation of maintenance work, and Fast Food Education, which discusses the dehumanizing nature of edtech programs. I still find writing exruciatingly difficult to do, so I'm proud that I was able to talk about such tricky topics.\n+ It's an honor to teach others, whether it's through large-scale workshops or 1:1 mentorship. Being able to see people grow up-close is priceless.\n\n4.  What is the significance of bridging technology and humanity, and how do you hope we can achieve that?\n\nTechnology is not neutral. The products and platforms we use will always reflect the intentions of their creators. So if they aren't conscious of how their creations can affect their users, people are bound to get hurt. For example, take Facebook's recent scandal, in which a leaked internal report stated that Instagram harms teenagers by fostering their insecurities. People in the humanities ‚Äî sociology, psychology, philosophy, etc. ‚Äî could've seen this from a mile way. This is why I'm always talking about the intersection of tech and the humanities with others; I believe that arming creatives and technologists with this knowledge is crucial to building a better world.\n\n\n5.  What are your tech goals?\n\nCurrently, I'm interested in learning more about Web3. The potential it holds for empowering creators and communities is exciting, and I want to know how to make use of this. I joined the KERNEL fellowship, where I'll be learning and building in the blockchain space for 8 weeks. Let's see where it takes me!\n\nI also aspire to create my own course from scratch, from designing the curriculum to teaching the sessions. For this, I've been exploring topics like knowledge management and critical design. It's a lot of work though, phew. Hopefully, I'll have one done by next year!\n\n6.  What do you think technology and UX design can do for the world?\n\nI believe that technology and design can bring people alive, realizing that they can create the change they want to see in the world. Instead of being passive onlookers, they become active participants. For instance, see how the youth are acting in our current political climate. On their own volition, they make crucial information accessible and advocate for their rights online; they've done this through graphics, websites, protests, and more. \n\n7.  What's the best advice that you can give to other aspiring Filipina tech trailblazers?\n\nEngage your curiousities. We live in a world where we are pressured to follow set paths (e.g. choosing \"safe\" majors and working in \"secure\" companies). But there's value in  keeping off the beaten track, even if it's not inherently obvious. Looking back, I can say that what seemed like terrifying or random decisions (e.g. teaching my first workshop, signing up for an international fellowship, joining a 1-week designathon) ended up being integral to my growth. Cultivate serendipity in your life!\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.723605439Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2021-10-09":{"title":"2021-10-09","content":"## And A Half \n### Lectures\nSee [notes](https://nikkidatlangin.notion.site/SPDP-2021-273ae324f61b44cc957c3fe34b8a85ac)\n###  Food Sovereignty Workshop\nSee [brief](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19rdRP61sQQznRfXkouoFQ8VKZYvNqpuCshsyrz4c_DA/edit), [Intro board](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lt18Cl8=/) and [Miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_l15mrfE=/)\n**Ideas:**\n+ [Why more public libraries are doubling as food distribution hubs](https://theconversation.com/why-more-public-libraries-are-doubling-as-food-distribution-hubs-160674)\n+ [Introduction to Digital Permaculture ‚Äî A World of Solutions](https://medium.com/@sacha.pignot/introduction-to-digital-permaculture-a-world-of-solutions-7aba4cb3c3a5)\n+ [Little Free Pantry](https://www.littlefreepantry.org/home)\n+ [Little libraries become food pantries during COVID-19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEwjN1NT0_0)\n+ ","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.723605439Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2021-10-18":{"title":"2021-10-18","content":"## PHILO13\n#philosophy \n### The Reflection Process\n\u003e ‚ÄúPhilosophy was a mode of existing-in-the-world,which had to be practiced at each instant, and the goal was to transform the whole of the individual‚Äôs life.‚Äù \n\u003e ‚ÄúThus, philosophy was a ==way of life==, both in its exercise and effort to achieve wisdom, for real wisdom does not merely cause us to know:it makes us be in a different way.‚Äù\n\u003e \n\u003e Pierre Hadot, *Philosophy as a Way of Life*\n\n+ **Knowledge imposes responsibility**\n+ People run away from knowledge because they are afraid of the ==enormous gravity of their own freedom==\n\t+ They see freedom us making us liable to freedom rather than ==enabling us to effect renewal==\n\t+ so they forfeit it\n\t\t+ Connected to: [[Cards/The alternative to freedom is unconsciousness]]\n\t+ What is human is ==to face reality, to constantly and actively seek the truth==, because the demand of our humanity is that we be responsible\n\n#### Four Moments\n1. **Experience**\n\t1. our encounter with the moral theory.

The families came first, then tribes, clans, and eventually whole societies. This clustering facilitated human survival, the satisfaction of basic needs, and the development of communication. Part of such communication was ==the direction and guidance of conduct.==‚Äù \n\u003e \n\u003e\"Conduct contrary to established and approved ways of doing things came to be discouraged and often punished. Prohibitions emerged and certain kinds of conduct were considered wrong. Other kinds were permitted or even expressly required and were deemed right or obligatory. Directives for regulating conduct coalesced over time into rules and principles as settled habits became transformed into customs and practices.‚Äù\n\u003e\n\u003e - Robert Holmes, *Basic Moral Philosophy*\n\n#### Twofold Elements\n+ **Value**\n\t+ *Values ==define the life of peoples and societies== and often provide ==unique identifiers of their culture.== Values predate ethics and form the background of many other moral concepts derived from them principles, norms, laws, virtues.*\n\t+ One of the most important goals of ethics is the ==intellectual analysis of values and value conflicts==, in order to define our duties.\n+ **Duty**\n\t+ The experience of duty is one of the most universal characteristics of human life. There is ==no human society without some rules of conduct== in the form of either prohibitions or obligations.\n\t+ People everywhere consider that some things ought to be done and others avoided. There is a duty to act in certain ways rather than others.\n#### Criterion and Directive\n+ *The primacy of values and the universality of duty in human society form the ==bases for evaluating individual conduct.==*\n+ They also provide the ==framework for making decisions.== It is the aim of ethics to equip us with rational justification for the action that we intend to perform.\n\n### Aquinas\n#### Background\n+ had royal blood\n+ family actively tried to prevent him from becoming a Dominican\n+ His life may be summed up in a few words: praying, preaching, teaching, writing, journeying.\n\n#### Thomistic  Moral Theory\n+ Morality is the quest for happiness.\n+ *Happiness is closely associated with the end or purpose of man.*\n+ To achieve happiness man must fulfill his purpose.\n\n+ **Aristotle:** envisioned a naturalistic morality through which men could achieve virtue by ==fulfilling their natural end==\n+ **Aquinas:** added the ==doctrine of the supernatural end of man== and proposed a double level of morality according to his dual ends\n\t+ Being a Christian, Aquinas taught that human nature has its ==source and ultimate end in God.==\n\t+ Therefore, ==human nature does not contain its own standard of fulfillment. ==\n\t\t+ It is not enough for a man to be simply a man and to exercise his natural functions and abilities in order to achieve perfect happiness. \n\t+ There is a double level of morality corresponding to man‚Äôs natural end and to his supernatural end.\n\n\u003e ‚ÄúDue to its potentiality and openness, the human soul is oriented to become actualized and fulfilled by something else....[N]ot one created good is in a position to fulfill wholly the infinite striving of the human being.... Due to its infinity, human striving cannot come to rest in creation, therefore, ==‚Äòhuman happiness consists in God alone.==‚Äô‚Äù\n\u003e \n\u003e George Wieland, ‚ÄúHappiness,‚Äù *The Ethics of Aquinas*\n\n#### Will\n##### Its Role\n\u003e ‚ÄúMoral acts are willed acts. Where the will does not operate, action has no moral quality whatsoever and falls back into the category of mere natural activity. And even in moral actions, external acts have a moral quality only because they have been commanded by the will. ==Thus moral goodness is located first and foremost in the will.==‚Äù\n\u003e \n\u003e David M. Gallagher, ‚ÄúThe Will and Its Acts‚Äù\n\n+ A person is said to be good or bad simply or morally, on the basis of his will, for ==it is through the will that everything else in the person is used well or badly.==\n+ *Moral action is willed action and morally good action arises from a good will.*\n\n##### Its Nature\n+ *the power or faculty of the soul by which a human agent is in control of his actions*\n+ ==*The will is the power of choice.*==\n\n\u003e ‚ÄúTo have control means that when the person acts, it is possible to act otherwise or not to act at all. This mode of acting is contrasted to the mode of nature in which an agent is determined to act in only one way and cannot do otherwise than it does.‚Äù\n\u003e \n\u003e David M. Gallagher, ‚ÄúThe Will and Its Acts‚Äù\n\n+ **Reason -\u003e Will -\u003e Action**\n+ The full range of appetites seeks to be satisfied and in man the process of satisfaction requires that choices be made between alternatives. ==The choice must be made by the will under the direction of reason.==\n+ If the right choices are made, a person achieves happiness.\n\n#### The Moral Constitution of Man\n+ *The moral constitution of man consists of ==sensuality, appetites, the will, and reason.*==\n+ If a man were moved to act by his appetites in a mechanical or rigorously determined way, ==his acts would not be free and could not be considered from a moral point of view.==\n+ Not only is freedom a prerequisite for an act to be considered moral.\n+ ==*An act is human only if it is free.*==\n+ Freedom is possible where there is ==knowledge of alternatives== and the ==power of the will to make choices.==\n+ Not every choice is correct. The will by itself cannot always make the right move.\n+ *Reason or the intellect* must serve as its guide.\n+ *When the intellect directs the will, it helps the will to choose the good.*\n+ The virtues of the natural man are achieved when the appetites are duly controlled by the will and reason.\n+ The natural end of man is further realized through his ==knowledge of the natural or the moral law.==\n+ **Law -\u003e Reason -\u003e Will**\n+ *When reason is guided by the law, it is able to guide the will properly.*\n+ **The Moral Law -\u003e Reason -\u003e Will -\u003e The Exterior Act**\n\n\u003e Law is a dictate of practical reason for the common good promulgated by one who has care of the community. A supposed law that lacks any of these four criteria is not a genuine law.\n\u003e \n\u003e Coercion is not of the essence of law but ==coercion by threat of sanction is necessary because not all subjects will readily listen to the law.==\n\u003e \n\u003e - Clifford G.

Kossel, ‚ÄúNatural Law and Human Law‚Äù\n\n###### Precepts of the Natural Law\n+ **General:** *Good is to be pursued and evil is to be avoided.*\n+ **Particular:** As being -\u003e as animal -\u003e as rational\n\t+ As being: to preserve the self (e.g. plant)\n\t+ As animal: to propagate the species (e.g. pet)\n\t+ As rational: to tend to the truth (e.g. human)\n\n+ Morality is not an arbitrary set of rules for behavior.\n+ ==*The basis of moral obligation is found in the very nature of man.*==\n+ Although the ‚Äòcommon‚Äô principles of natural law cannot be abolished from the mind as universals, they may be eliminated in a particular action because ==reason may be impeded from applying the universal principle to the particular action by some passion.==\n\t+ E.G. Bad beliefs, evil customs, corrupt habbits\n\n##### The Human Law\n+ *==specific statutes of government== derived from the general precept of the natural law*\n+ ‚ÄúFrom the precepts of the natural law, the human reason needs to proceed to the more particular determination of certain matters.‚Äù\n+ + What gives a rule the character of law is its ==moral dimension, its conformity with the precepts of natural law, its agreement with the moral law.==\n+ *‚ÄúEvery human law has just so much of the nature of law, as it is derived from the law of nature.‚Äù*\n+ If in any point it ==deflects from the law of nature==, it is no longer a law but a ==perversion of law. ==\n\t+ Such a law no longer binds in conscience but is sometimes obeyed in order to prevent an even greater evil. \n\t+ Such command should otherwise not be obeyed.\n+ **Limits of Human Law**\n\t+ Human law can be contrary to divine law.\n\t+ Human law is affected by the uncertainty of human judgment, especially in particular and contingent matters with which morality and law deal.\n\t+ Human law is only about matters that humans can judge, and these are exterior acts of virtue.\n\t+ Human law cannot prohibit or punish all evils.\n+ **Unjust Human Laws**; laws can be unjust in 2 ways:\n\t+ when it is contrary to the human good by violating any of the requirements of law\n\t+ when it violates the divine good or law, such as laws requiring idolatry\n+ E.G.

In fact, there are two divine laws, related not as two species, but as the imperfect to the perfect. It was part of the divine pedagogy to prepare His people through fear of punishment for the new covenant of love poured into our hearts by the Holy Spirit. This law is necessary especially because humans are called to a destiny which transcends the natural order and the human power of achievement; so special directives were needed for the achievement of this end.\n\u003e \n\u003e - Clifford G. Kossel, ‚ÄúNatural Law and Human Law‚Äù\n\n#### Kinds of Acts\n+ **The Human Act** is composed of...\n\t+ **Human Act** (actus humanus): *actions over which man is the master*\n\t\t+ They are properly called human because they are ==rationally controlled== and are ==voluntary.==\n\t+ **Act of Man** (actio hominis): actions not regulated and directed by reason\n\t\t+ They characterize and manifest the ==generic nature of man== or his ==participation in animal life.==\n\n\u003e==Human acts and moral acts are synonymous.== Anything done with deliberation, consciously, voluntarily, counts as a human action. Not every event or activity that can truly be ascribed to a human person counts as a human act. Digesting, ageing, falling when dropped, are called ‚Äòacts of man‚Äô but not human acts. Thinking and all other activities that come under the sway of thought are moral acts, human acts. It is one thing for Socrates‚Äô beard to be growing, it is another for Socrates to grow a beard.\n\u003e \n\u003e - Ralph McInerny, ‚ÄúAquinas‚Äôs Moral Theory‚Äù\n\n#### The Morality of the Act\n*There are 3 factors that determine the morality of an act:*\n+ **Objectum**: *the purpose of the act*\n+ **Finis**: *the intention of the agent*\n+ **Circumstantia**: the factors affecting the act\n\nThe objective of the human act inherently constitutes the reality of the human act while the end of the moral agent and the circumstances of the act enter into or areintegral to the full reality of the human act.\n\n##### Objectum\n+ *specific purpose of the act*\n+ The objective can ==cause a human act to be morally good or evil== even without considering either the end of the moral agent or the circumstances.\n\t+ *bonum in genere*: good of its kind\n\t+ *malum in genere*: evil of its kind\n\n\u003e The central defining feature of an action---which establishes its species, i.e., what kind of action it is---is the objectum. The object or objective is what the person or agent is ==planning to achieve in the immediate sense.== This must be ==differentiated from the larger purpose or end,== which is also relevant to the moral assessment of an act, but does not give the action its specific nature.‚Äù\n\u003e \n\u003e - Daniel Westberg, ‚ÄúGood and Evil in Human Acts‚Äù\n\n###### Morally Neutral Actions\n+ There are certain acts that we do consciously and willingly which cannot be easily classified as good or evil if we judge them only on the basis of their respective objectives.\n+ They can become good or evil, however, if ==we consider the circumstances and the end or motive of the moral agent==. In a concrete case, a particular human act is done for a specific purpose and in a designed manner, at a preferred time and place, and the like. The intention and circumstances of the objectively neutral act are either in conformity or against the norm of reasonable behavior, and so, it is either morally good or morally evil.\n\n\n##### Finis Operantis\n+ The end of the agent can ==provide moral species== to the human act, or it can cause a good act to differ in kind from an evil act.\n+ An act that is *objectively* good can become evil due to the evil intention of the moral agent. The intention or end of the moral agent can cause a human act to be morally good or morally evil of its kind.\n+ **Finis Operis**\n\t+ end of the act\n\t+ exterior purpose of the act\n+ **Finis Operantis**\n\t+ end of the agent\n\t+ interior purpose of the agent\n\n##### Circumstantia\n*contributes ot the goodness/badness of an act*\n![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20211028232407.png]]\n\n+ The circumstances are ==accidents of the human act== since they are outside the essence or specific nature of the human act.\n+ A human act is not fully good, though it is good in its kind and its intended end, ==unless it is done in a proper way, at the right place and time, and even for the right beneficiary.==\n\n##### Acts of the Will\n*Only those actions which proceed from deliberate will are called properly human.*\n+ **Internal**: *the proper acts of the will itself*\n+ **External**: *acts done as commanded by the will*\n\n+ The interior act of the will and the exterior deed ==compose a single act.== \n\t+ There are times when an act that takes place exhibits a double good or evil and sometimes only one. \n\t+ So the moral goodness or evil of an act is sometimes identical from the interior and exterior points of view and sometimes it is different.\n+ For the act to be good, willing a good end is not enough. The object must also be good. Sometimes the exterior act is good because of the good end.\n+ *Does the exterior act increase the goodness or badness of the interior act?*\n\n+ **Repetition:** *Doing an action repeatedly can increase the quality of the will‚Äôs intention.*\n+ **Extent:** *The tenacity in pursuing the goal to conclusion may serve either the goodness or the badness of the act.*\n+ **Intensity:** *Certain actions, as instances of pleasure and pain, make the will more intense or more remiss.*\n\t+ In cases where the will is not deficient but circumstances totally prevent the execution of the act, ==there is no diminishment of the goodness of the will.==\n\n##### The Consequence of an Act\n+ The consequence does not make an action that was evil to be good, nor one that was good to be evil.\n+ Examples\n\t+ If a person gives alms to a beggar who then misuses the gift of money to buy *shabu*, the generosity of the giver is not diminished.\n\t+ If after undergoing torture a prisoner develops the virtue of patience, the torturer is not excused just because his action turned into something good.\n\t+ If the insult hurled by a teacher at his student challenged the latter to do his best, that does not make the insult a good act and the teacher a good man.\n\n###### Foreseen Consequences\n*form part of the goodness or badness of an act*\n+ When the consequences are naturally connected to the action itself, a reasonable person would normally expect such results, ==the agent should be anticipating them==, and these increase the goodness or malice of the action---==the consequences determine the object of the action.==\n\n###### Unforeseen Consequences\n+ When the consequences are rarer or more incidental, and one would not normally anticipate them, then they do not increase the goodness or badness of the act.\n\n##### Modifiers of Voluntariness\n*factors that undermine mastery of the human acts*\n+ **Violence:** *coercion or imposition by an external principle*\n\t+ ‚ÄúWhen external acts are done through force or violence they are involuntary since they are contrary to the will of the person coerced.‚Äù\n+ **Fear:** *caused by threat of evil which can be avoided by adopting certain measures*\n\t+ An act done out of fear is voluntary because ==despite the fear, the act can be considered to emanate from the will and presupposes an interior act of willing.==\n+ **Concupiscence**\n\t+ There are instances, though rare, when concupiscence or the lust for a delightful object or a pleasurable activity is so intense that it overpowers reason and the subsequent act is appropriately considered as an animal act since it does not originate from reason and will but entirely from passion.\n\t+ Since there is no internal act of the will, either of consent or of resistance, then the act is neither voluntary nor involuntary.\n+ **Ignorance:** *privation of the requisite knowledge*\n\t+ Concomitant: *accompanies the doing of an act which would still be done even if there were knowledge prior to the execution of the act*\n\t\t+ Concomitant ignorance does not cause an act to be involuntary because ==it does not result to something that is contrary to the will.==\n\t+ Consequent Ignorance:\n\t\t+ Ignorance of wrong choice, ignorance of universal principles, affected ignorance\n\t\t+ *a consequence of the will because the person deliberately avoids to have knowledge of what he can and should know*\n\t\t+ ==All acts that follow from consequent ignorance ae voluntary.==\n\t+ Antecedent Ignorance: *precedes the act of willing and causes the moral agent to will and then do that which he would not have willed and done*\n\t\t+ Antecedent ignorance causes an act to be involuntary.\n\n\n--- \nApplied to analysis essay\n+ natural law: it is not morally right to bribe lol, because it is unfair, it impedes democracy\n+ human law: law against vote buying\n+ divine law: 10 commandments?

Para bang nabibigo tayong makakita ng isang uri ng ==kaayusan sa ating buhay, lipunan, at mundo== (_dike_ ang salita ng mga Griyego para sa 'kaayusan', na siyang salita rin nila para sa 'katarungan'). Kaya sa halip na magmula sa pagkamangha, maaaring ang ==**karanasan ng** **pagkabigo**== naman ang siyang nag-uudyok sa atin na maghanap ng higit na pag-unawa sa sarili natin o sa daigdig.\n\n\"What truth did we lean on...that might steady her too if her faith should happen to stumble?\" This is the main question tackled in the poem. We reckon with this everyday in a world that seems to never run out of dissapointing experiences: death, disasters, war, and more, all of which seem to happen unexpectedly. To deal with these experiences, we turn to structured truths ‚Äî a.k.a. philosophies ‚Äî for answers (e.g. science and religion). That is why this poem is titled \"Introduction to Philosophy\".\n\n\"Anong katotohanan ang pag-asa namin kung mawala ang paniniwala namin?\" Ito ang pangunahing tanong sa tula. Tinalakay namin ito araw-araw sa isang mundo na punuin ng  karanansan ng pagkabigo: kamatayan, kapahamakan, digmaan, atbp. Para kayahin natin, hahanapin kami ng sagot sa mga katotohanan na may balangkas ‚Äî o pilosoopiya (hal. agham at relihiyon). Ito ang dahilan kung bakit ang pangalan ng tula ay \"Pambungad sa Pilosopiya\".\n\n### Relihiyon \n#### Karanasang Relihiyoso\n- Habang sa unang tingin ay dalawang magkaibang paksa ang mga ito‚Äîkung saan ang **pilosopiya** ay ==pumapatungkol sa **kaalaman at karunungan**==, habang ang **relihiyon** naman ay may ==kinalaman sa **paniniwala at pananampalataya**==‚Äîmay mga pagkakataong hindi madaling ipaghiwalay ang dalawa.\n\t- Hindi sila pwede maghiwalay\n- Ano ba ang halimbawa ng mga ==**relihiyosong tanong**== na maaaring siyang tinutugunan ng iba't ibang relihiyon? Bukod sa kabiguang maunawaan itong \"fact of unequal portions\" na pinagtakahan ng babaeng estudyante sa tula ni Carl Denis, ==ano pa bang mga karanasan ang masasabi nating naghahatid sa tao na magtanong ukol sa kung mayroon bang isang uri ng kaayusan sa buhay ng tao sa daigdig?==\n\nAno itong **\"****nada\"** na tinutukoy ni Hemingway na siyang tila iniiwasan ng nakatatandang serbidor? Paano mailalarawan itong karanasan ng **\"nada\"**? Naranasan mo na ba ito?\n\nIn my perspective, the nada Hemingway is referring to is to the meaninglessness of life: nothing. Is my work important? Will people remember me? Will the world be the same without me? These are the existential questions that constantly occupy our minds, and life will give us no answers for them. People deal with this nothing by being driven to despair or making their own meaning for themselves. I relate to the old men in the story; they cope with this feeling by settling into routines (e.g. drinking in cafes). Routines also calm me because they're under my control, unlike the nothing of life.\n\nSa palagay ko, ang *nada* na tinutukoy ni Hemingway ay ang pagkawala ng kahulugan ng buhay. Mahalaga ba ang ginawa ko? Maalaala ba nila ako? Maging katulad ba ang mundo kung wala na ako? Palaging nasa utak namin ang mga tanong na ito, at walang nagbibigay ng sagot ng buhay namin. Paano tumutugon ang mga tao sa kawalan na ito? Nawawalan sila ng pag-asa, o ginagawa nila ang sariling kahulugan. Ang mga matandang lalaki sa kwento ay nakakaugnay para sa akin; gumawa sila ng karaniwang gawain para kayanin nila ang pakiramdam ng nawalan (hal. nag-iinom sa restawan). Nakakatulong din ang mga karaniwang gawain para sa akin dahil kaya kong kontrolin, hindi katulad ng kawalan ng buhay.\n\nNaniniwala ako sa Diyos, pero nagdududa ako sa relihiyon. Ang sanhi nito ay ang positibong karanasan: nakikita ko na maraming ta sa simbahan ay gumagawa ng masama (hal. ang mga kasalanan ni Apollo Quiloboy at ang diskriminasyon sa mga LGBTQ+, nag-iisang ina, atbp.). Kahit palagi silang magsalita ng kabutihan, iba ang sinasabi ng aksyon nila. Sa palagay ko, sumasalungat ang gawa nila sa mga pagtuturo ng Diyos. \"Kung naunwaan mo, hindi iyan Diyos.\" Dahil dito napagtanto ko na maliit na talagatungkol sa Diyos. Pwede ko bang sabihin na kung anu ang dapat ituro niya? May espirituwal na awtoridad ng mga relihiyon, pero kulang din ang kaalaman nila tungkol sa Diyos. Kahit sino ka, lumampas siya sa inyong abot-tanaw. Kahit hindi ako maunawaan ng Diyos, maniwala ako sa kanya kasi tinutulungan niya akong maging mas mabuting tao. Kung alam ko ng lahat, wala akong gagawin; titigil ako sa pagtatanong at pagsasalamin dahil naging konteto ako sa kaalaman ko. Mananatili akong tao dahil sa prosesong ito.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.723605439Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2022-02-12":{"title":"2022-02-12","content":"## CSCI\n#computerscience\n### Clean Code Checklist\n#### Names\n- [x] Use **intention revealing names**\n- [ ] Avoid **disinformation**\n- [x] Make **meaningful distinctions**\n- [ ] Use **pronounceable names**\n- [ ] Avoid **mental mapping**\n- [ ] **Class names and objects** should have noun/noun phrases\n- [ ] **Method names** should have verb/verb phrases\n- [ ] Pick one word per concept\n- [ ] Don't pun (avoid using the same word for 2 purposes)\n- [ ] Use CS terms where necessary;

Plants are attracted to the sun because it enables them to surive\n\t\t2. Part of the plants' \"design\"\n\t\t3. Doesn't reflect choice, but \"design\", just like with man\n\t\t4. ==\"Moral phototropism\":== man is attracted towards the good because it is in the doing of the good that man becomes most fully himself.\n2. This experience leads us to observe that there is a **connaturality between man and value**\n\t1. Connaturality: connected by nature\n\t2. E.G. Cellphone and SIM card, diesel engine and diesel fuel\n\t3. Means more than \"bagay\"; they are designed to function together\n\t4. This is the claim we make regarding moral phototropism\n3. Machines have an **instruction manual**, while we humans did not come with this\n\t1. So how do we know the design of man? This is done by reflecting on the experience of conscience\n4. What is the **experience of conscience?** \n\t1. The experience of...\n\t\t1. Being drawn towards the good and being repelled by evil\n\t\t2. Fulfillment and satisfaction when we do good, etc\n\t\t3. Inner conflict and turmoil when we violate the good that we know\n\t2. Similar to voltage and \"reaction\"\n\t3. Sense of responsibility for the decision that one makes\n5. What does this tell us about **the ‚Äúdesign‚Äù  of the human person, what he ought to become, the Christian understanding of the human person,** in other words?\n\t1. Man becomes most fully himself in the doing of the good\n\t2. Man was designed to be fulfilled and satisfied in doing the good\n\t3. Man was \"designed\" refers to a creator, better to the Creator\n\t4. SIN, the doing of evil (violating good) is self-destructive\n\t5. \"Doing of evil\" not merely violation of the law, but also destruction or non-realization of a value, and ultimately the human person\n\n\n#### Conscience as PROCESS\n- demanded by the human characteristic\n- even if we want to do good, this isn't always clear. why?\n\t- competing values (e.g. loving v.s. disciplining child)\n\t- ambiguous culture (e.g. seeking revenge obstructs the value of forgiveness)\n\t- incomplete knowledge (e.g. radioactive substances \u0026 the Curie couple)\n\t- changing circumstances (e.g. function of money from medium of exchange to productive good)\n- our hold of the truth is ==fragile, tentative, and not quite absolute==\n- this means that we need to be humble; there's always possibility for error and we need to adapt; ==constantly examine and re-examine our norms== (e.g. age of criminal responsibility)\n- This responsibility is constant and societal\n- What does a **sincere and concrete conscience** mean?\n\t- Sincerity: subjective quality of an individual who searches for the truth\n\t- Correctness: conformity to the objective good, \"almost\" the end-result of sincerity\n- ^ Related\n\t- a sincere conscience always seeks to be correct....always seeking information/enlightenment (v.s. blissful ignorance)\n\t- sincerity may result in \"objective\" correctness, but not always\n- The **Magisterium of the Church** are important in this process (seeking enlightenment)\n\t- long history of teaching and upholding moral values\n\t- trans-cultural character avoids cultural bias/narrowness\n\t- presence of Holy Spirit guides and enlightens the Church\n- What does this process say about the **human person**? (Christian anthropology)\n\t-   It emphasizes the responsibility of the individual to consult and to be open to change; to have a well-formed and well-informed conscience.  \n\t- It underscores the centrality of stable fundamental **values**, as compared to **norms** that concretize and enforce these values.\n\t- ==norms may change; values remain==\n\n#### Conscience as event/judgement\n*concerning the good to be done or the evil to be avoided*\n\n1. **The event itself**\n\t1. When we talk about \"following my conscience\", or that \"my conscience is clear\", etc...it is ==conscience/3== that we refer to\n\t2. It is the concrete judgement of a specific person in a specific situation\n\t3. Therefore, it is not ==universal==\n\t4. Conscience does not legislate norms but it applies the norms to a concrete situation (making it a proximate norm)\n\t5. Judgement of conscience is ==morally infallible==\n\t\t1. does not obviate/exclude objective or factual error\n\t6. What it means that the person acting according to best interests cannot be accused of acting in bad aith, immorally, or commiting a sin\n\t\t1.  Because a person's most ==serious obligation== is to do the good he knows, to follow a well-formed conscience\n\t7. ==Relationship== of Conscience/3 and the Magist of the Church\n\t\t1. the person must follow his consience because the Magist is exercised by human beings who can be ==subject to error==\n\t\t2. ==Autonomy of conscience:== man must make that decision himself; he cannot pass on the responsibility to anyone else\n\t\t\t1. If man is not held responsible, he is treated like a child, not taken seriously, robbed of dignity as a human person\n2. **What does this say about the human person?**\n\t1. \"Man's dignity lies in observing this law and by it he will be judged\"\n\t2. ==Moral infallibility of conscience:== the moral quality of our judgements and the actions that follow thereform is determined by how much they conform with the judgement of a well-formed and well-informed conscience, the good as we know it\n\t3. A person's moral responsibility: to follow a ==well-formed== (honest, sincere) and ==well-informed== (correct) conscience\n\t\t1. Also implies a \"prior\" responsibility that the person must ensure his conscience follows this\n\t\t2. If the conscience is not well-informed, then it does not deserve the obedience that we say we owe it\n\t\t3. What if we emphasize the need for objective good...and trust decision making to external agents...we would end up making a false god, robbing people of their dignity\n\t4. The supremacy of conscience/3 is that the obligation of the human person (see above ^) underscores the ==DIGNITY OF THE PERSON==\n\t\t1. The person must make the judgement himself that he knows is in his conscience, and is ultimately responsible for that decision, and eventually for the kind of person that he will become\n\n#### TL;DR\nwhat conscience says about the \"design\" of the human person\n\t\t1. ==Conscience/1 (the experience of conscience):== indicates that man becomes most fully himself in the doing of the good\n\t\t2. ==Conscience/2 (conscience as process):== emphasizes the responsibility of the person to ensure that the conscience is well-formed (honest, sincere) and well-informed (correct)\n\t\t3. ==Conscience/3 (judgement):== underscores the dignity of the human person. The person decides and is ultimately responsible for the decision that he makes. He cannot pass on that responsibility to anyone else.","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.723605439Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2022-02-15":{"title":"2022-02-15","content":"## Story and Narrative in STEM\n#science #technology #storytelling\n### Propp v.s.

Are we just going to map out stories for their structures?_\n+ The \"storyness\" that Science upholds, as a discipline is this: **_Rational thought, allied to scientific reasoning would lead inevitably toward moral, social, and ethical progress._**\n\t+ This is why the Philippines did not move an inch from this global catastrophe right now. The current administration refuses to abide by this grand narrative of Science and instead, chooses to go against it.

It's stories that tell us how these binaries can be addressed and understood.¬†\n\t+ The narrative structure that every story has also pointed us into the future, teaching us a way to live our lives, where we eventually discover who we are, what it is we need, what it is we have to do to fulfill that need, who will help us along the way, and where it is we have to go before we can truly find ourselves home again.\n+ Thomas says these stories **\"provide us with scripts that help us to navigate and make sense of experiences that we all share as human beings.\"** This idea was reinforced by one of my favorite philosophers, Joseph Campbell:\n\u003e _The idea, since forever, has been that story is a conveyance, a vehicle, to use in order to think, to move forward through life. At the end of a life that has meaning, the point is not that one is perfected, but that one will still carry a view of self and the world that is divine‚Äîand not just some kind of lazy drift.

Ngunit ito ay marahil dala ng dalawang bagay: \n\t- ==limitado tayo==\n\t- ==ang Diyos ay pinaniniwalaang walang hangganan.==\n- Limitado tayo sa ating kayang malaman sabay ang Diyos naman ay **ibang-iba** o **lumalampas** sa mga bagay na nakikita, nararanasan, namamasdan, at nasusuri natin. \n\t- Ang paglampas na iyan ang tatawagin nating **pagsasaibayo** **ng Diyos sa lahat**. \n\t\t- O ayon muli kay San Agustin: _**Deus**_ **_semper_** _**major**._ Nangangahulugan ito na ang Diyos ay laging humihigit _o \"ever greater.\"_\n- Kung hindi Siya sumasaibayo o laging nakahihigit, o kung kagaya lamang Siya ng anumang bagay sa daigdig (obheto) na madaling makita, mahawakan, masukat, maunawaan--kung ganyan lamang Siya, ==masasabi mo pa bang Diyos iyon?

One authority says: ‚ÄòIf I had a God whom I could understand, I should never consider him God.‚Äô If you can understand anything about him, it in no way belongs to him, and insofar as you understand anything about him that brings you into incomprehension, and from incomprehension you arrive at a brute‚Äôs stupidity . . . So if you do not wish to be brutish, do not understand God who is beyond words (Meister Eckhart, Sermon 83: _Renovamini spiritu_).*\n\n##### Pagsubok kay Job\n- Ito ang isang halimbawa na baka makatulong sa pag-unawa natin sa sinabi ni Agustin na \"_Si comprehendis non est Deus_.\"\n- Ngunit baka maaari natin muling balikan ang naging karanasan ni Job mula sa punto de bista ng tanong tungkol sa kakayahan natin maunawaan ang Diyos.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GswSg2ohqmA\n\n- Sa **palagay** ni Job--at iyan din ang palagay o **kuro-kuro** ng mga kaibigan niya (_speculation_ ayon sa video) na nakipagtalo sa kanya at sinabing **dapat** may mali siyang ginawa para maranasan niya iyon--sa palagay _nilang lahat_ namuhay si Job sa isang paraan na **hindi dapat** makaranas ng ganoong klaseng paghihirap. \n- **Sa kanilang pag-unawa**, para dumaan si Job sa lahat ng pagdurusang naranasan niya ay tila absurdo, na nagpapakita lamang na hindi talaga makatarungan o hindi talaga mabuti ang Diyos gaya ng inasahan nila.\n- hindi talaga nagpaliwanag ang Diyos sa paraan na inaasahan ni Job. Sa halip na sagutin ang mga tanong ni Job, sa halip na bigyan si Job ng mga malilinaw na dahilan, ang Diyos ang _sumubok_ sa kaalaman at karunungan ni Job.\n\n\u003e Then the Lord answered Job out of the storm. He said: ‚ÄúWho is this that darkens my counsel with words without knowledge? Brace yourself like a man; I will question you, and you shall answer me. **Where were you when I laid the earth‚Äôs foundation? Tell me, if you understand.** Who marked off its dimensions? **Surely you know!** Who stretched a measuring line across it? On what were its footings set, or who laid its cornerstone‚Äîwhile the morning stars sang together and all the angels shouted for joy? Who shut up the sea behind doors when it burst forth from the womb, when I made the clouds its garment and wrapped it in thick darkness, when I fixed limits for it and set its doors and bars in place, when I said, ‚ÄòThis far you may come and no farther; here is where your proud waves halt‚Äô? Have you ever given orders to the morning, or shown the dawn its place, that it might take the earth by the edges and shake the wicked out of it? The earth takes shape like clay under a seal; its features stand out like those of a garment. The wicked are denied their light, and their upraised arm is broken. Have you journeyed to the springs of the sea or walked in the recesses of the deep? Have the gates of death been shown to you? Have you seen the gates of the shadow of death? ==**Have you comprehended the vast expanses of the earth? Tell me, if you know all this**== [(Job 38: 1-18 NIV) (Links to an external site.)](https://biblehub.com/niv/job/38.htm).\n\n- Sa huli, walang nasumbat si Job sa lahat ng tanong ng Diyos maliban dito: ‚ÄúI know that you can do all things; no purpose of yours can be thwarted. You asked, ‚ÄòWho is this that obscures my plans without knowledge?‚Äô Surely ==**I spoke of things I did not understand,** **things too wonderful for me to know**==\" ([Job 42: 1-3 (Links to an external site.)](https://biblehub.com/niv/job/42.htm)).\n- palagay ko iyon ang tunay na '**pagsubok**' kay Job. Ang pagsubok ay ==kung kaya ba niyang **manalig** at **manampalataya** sa isang Diyos na hindi niya kailanman maiintindihan.==\n\n##### Takdang Aralin 1\nAno ang palagay mo sa pahayag ni San Agustin na **\"**_**Si comprehendis non est Deus\"**_? \n\n==A. Kung **naniniwala** ka sa Diyos, anong implikasyon nito sa iyo? Kaya mo bang maniwala sa Diyos na hindi mo mauunawaan? ==\n\nB. Kung **hindi ka naman naniniwala** sa Diyos, ano ang kahulugan nito para sa iyo? Lalo lamang ba nito 'pinapatibay' ang iyong di-paniniwala sa Diyos? \n\nC. Kung **nag-aalangan ka** naman, o **nagdududa** ka kung may Diyos, lalo lamang ba nitong pinahihirapan ka na maniwala nang walang pasubali sa Diyos?\n\nGumamit lamang ng **150-170 na salita** at ingatan ang pagsususlat sa Filipino.\n\n---\n**Outline:**\n1. Intro\n\t1. I believe in God, but I've been struggling to believe in organized religion lately\n\t\t1. E.G. Religious leader Apollo Quiboloy's crimes\n\t\t2. E.G. Christian churches claiming that they're open, but then hate on homophobia\n\t3. Actions speak for themselves\n\t4. These go against what I see, in my perspective, are God's values\n2. Body\n\t1. \"Si comprehendis non est Deus\"; |\"Kung naunawaan mo, hindi iyan Diyos.\"\n\t2. Who am I to be certain of what God's values are? Even organized religions don't fully know what God is.\n\t3. I don't understand how the examples I mentioned above can find themselves aligned with God; bad things happen to good people for no reason; I don't fully understand God in the first place. if I spent a lifetime trying to understand him, I know that I'd never be able to grasp him fully...\n3. Conclusion\n\t1. Despite my lack of knowledge, I still believe in God. Why? Because...if i knew everything, then I would do nothing. I would stop trying to grow as a person because I would be content with what I know. Life is short, and I believe it would be a waste if  I didn't make the  most out of it. I want to be the best version of myself that I can be, and I believe that my faith in  God can help me with this\n\n**Filipino:**\nNaniniwala ako sa Diyos, pero nagdududa ako sa relihiyon. Ang sanhi nito ay ang positibong karanasan: nakikita ko na maraming tao sa simbahan ay ginagawa ng masama (hal. ang mga kasalanan ni Apollo Quiloboy at ang diskriminasyon sa mga LGBTQ+, nag-iisang ina, atbp.). Kahit palagi silang magsalita ng kabutihan, iba ang sinasabi ng aksyon nila. Sa palagay ko, sumasalungat ang gawa nila sa mga pagtuturo ng Diyos.\n\n\"Kung naunwaan mo, hindi iyan Diyos.\" Dahil dito, napagtanto ako na maliit lang talaga ang alam namin tungkol sa Diyos. Pwede ba ako sabihin na kung ano dapat ang patuturo niya? May espirituwal na awtoridad ng mga relihiyon, pero kulang din ang kaalaman nila tungkol sa DIyos. Kahit sino ka, lumampas siya sa inyong abot-tanaw.\n\nKahit hindi ako maunawaan ng Diyos, maniwala ako sa kanya kasi tinutulungan niya akong maging mas mabuting tao. Kung alam ko ng lahat, wala akong gagawin; titigil ako sa pagtatanong at pagsasalamin dahil naging konteto ako sa kaalaman ko. Mananatili akong tao dahil sa prosesong ito.\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.723605439Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2022-02-21":{"title":"2022-02-21","content":"\n## Philo\n#philosophy \n### Paninindigan\n- **Recap:**\n\t+ KURO-KURO: opinyon\n\t+ PANININDIGAN: conviction\n\t+ PANINIWALA: belief\n\t+ PANANAMPALATAYA: faith\n+ Sa madaling salita, heto ang mga 'baitang' o 'hakbang' mula kuro-kuro tungo sa pananampalataya. *(stages/steps/phases)*\n\t+ **KURO-KURO --\u003e PANININDIGAN --\u003e PANINIWALA --\u003e PANANAMPALATAYA**\n#### Sarado sa Hinaharap \n*(closed to the future)*\n\u003e Conviction here refers to a **limit, an end, a bar that has been drawn**.

Maaaring gumagalaw na siya sa antas ng ==**kalooban**== (\"willing\"), at hindi na lamang sa laranangan ng karanasan. \n\t+ Ayon nga kay Marcel: \"Atheism, however can be based not so much in an experience or the lack of an experience as on a claim, or more precisely, **on a willing** (p.130).\"\n+ Maaaring mangyari na hindi naniniwala ang isang tao _dahil ayaw niya lang talaga maniwala_. Para rin kay San Agustin, \"**_Credere non potest nisi volens_**.\" O \"hindi maniniwala ang tao maliban na lamang kung naisin niya.\" *(One will only believe what he wants)*\n\n### Paniniwala at Pagtitiwala\n+ Kung ang **paninindigan** ay laging nakatingin at tila nakapako *(staring)* sa **nakaraan**, ang **paniniwala** naman ay ==bukas sa **hinaharap** at sa mga maaaring dala nito.==\n+ _Credere_ ang Latin ng \"maniwala\" o \"to believe.\" Nariyan nanggagaling ang Ingles na salitang ==_credit_ kung saan tila may **pagpapahiram** na nagaganap.==\n\t+ Gaya ng isang bangko na 'nagtitiwala' na babayaran mo ang hiniram mong pera na pinambayad mo gamit ang kanilang _credit_ _card_, sa siyang pinaniniwalaan mo, ang pinapahiram mo sa kanya ay isang uri ng **pagtitiwala**. *(trust)*\n\t+ Tila may isang bagay kang ipinagkakatiwala sa kanya. Tila sinasabi mo sa kanya: =='Heto, ingatan mo ito'. 'Alagaan mo'.==  Sa penomenolohikal na paglalarawan ni Marcel kung gayon, tila ang ibig sabihin pala ng **paniniwala** ay **pagtitiwala**.\n+ Kapag nagtitiwala ka, nagtitiwala ka marahil *(possibility) ***sa** **isang tao (\"to believe in\")**. Hindi gaya ng paniniwala na nasa anyo ng isang kuro-kuro (\"**to believe that\"**), ayon kay Marcel ang pinagkakatiwalaan natin ay isang Ikaw o _Thou:_\n\t+ One can only trust a ‚Äú**thou**,‚Äù ==a reality capable of fulfilling the function of a ‚Äúthou,‚Äù of being invoked, of becoming something I can fall back on== (p.135).\n+ Nabubuo ang pagtitiwala sa pamamagitan ng isang pakikipag-ugnayan *(interrelation?)* sa isang matatawag na Ikaw (_Thou_).\n\t+ Ang pinagkakatiwalaan mo ay siyang ==maaaring tumugon *(respond?)* sa iyo.==¬† Siya ay may kakayahang ingatan ==ang pinahihiram mo na, sa huli, ay walang iba kundi ang sarili mo== (\"Actually, the credit that I extend is, in a way, myself. I lend myself to X,\" p.134). \n\t+ Ang tunay na pinaniniwalaan at pinagkakatiwalaan mo kung gayon ay ==isang Ikaw na kayang ingatan ang iyong sarili.==\n+ Sino ang siyang pinagkakatiwalaan mo? \n\t+ Madalas, maaaring iyan ang nanay, tatay, o kapatid mo. \n\t+ Maaaring ang mga matatalik mong kaibigan. \n\t+ Habang may iba naman na nagsasabi na may ==buong pagtitiwala sila sa Diyos==\n#### Pagkabigo at Pagtatakda\n*(Failure and Limitation)*\n+ Ngunit hindi maipagkakaila na minsan nabigo na rin tayo ng iba na pinagkatiwalaan natin.\n+ Alalahanin mo ang isang karanasan na binigo ka ng isang tao.\n\t+ Hal. isang kaibigan mo. May ipinagkatiwala ka sa kanya--maaaring ito ay isang lihim o isang pakiusap na gawin ang isang bagay para sa iyo. O maaaring inasahan mo na maging nandoon siya para sa iyo lagi. Ngunit nangyaring noong kinailangan mo siya, wala siya doon. Tila iniwan ka. Hindi niya iningatan ang ipinagkatiwala mo. Para bang inatasan mo siyang gawin o tuparin ang isang bagay para sa iyo, tapos hindi niya ito ginawa o tinupad.\n\t+ Pero paano ba posible mangyari ang madalas masaklap na karanasang ito? Paano ba posibleng mabigo ka ng isang tao, ang masira ang tiwala na binigay mo sa kanya? Kung nakaranas ka ng matinding kabiguan, at kung hindi na nabalik ang dating tiwala mo sa isang tao, baka ganito kasi ang nangyari ayon kay Marcel:\n\t+ I have placed my trust in a certain individual; he betrays me; if I had not established a completely inward relationship with him, or more precisely, with what I took to be him, this disappointment could not have touched me in the strict sense of the term; the fact is, however, that I am affected by it. . . . How was it possible to be disappointed, however? Because ==**my reliance on X had a conditional character**. **I counted on him to fulfill a certain task==,** for example: this task, as it happens, he did not fulfill; **I ascribed a certain determinate quality to him**; the event seems to demonstrate to me that he did not possess it. In sum, ==**I had formed an idea of him** which has now been contradicted and, as it were, nullified== (p.135-136).\n+ Nabibigo ka, halimbawa, ng isang kaibigan dahil habang ipinagkatiwala mo nga sa kanya ang iyong sarili, ==**nagtakda** *(set/established)* ka pala muna ng mga kundisyon sa kanya.==\n\t+ Nagtiwala ka sa kanya dahil sa mga **malilinaw na dahilan**.\n\t\t+ _Dahil_ ==nagpakita na siya **sa nakaraan** ng mga katangian na katiwa-tiwala siya.== _Dahil_ nakita mo na dati na hindi ka niya iniwan; na tinulungan ka niya noong kinailangan mo ito; na hindi niya sinabi sa iba ang iyong mga lihim, atbp.\n\t\t+ Nagbigay siya sa nakaraan ng **mga patunay** na kaibigan nga talaga siya, na maaari mo siyang pagkatiwalaan **ngayon** at pati na rin sa **hinaharap**.¬† At nagpapatuloy kang magtiwala _dahil_ inisip mo na kung ano ang ginawa niya o pinakita niya dati, ay iyon at iyon din sa eksakto at tumpak na paraan ang gagawin at ipapakita niya sa iyo sa hinaharap.\n\t+ Nasaan ang pagbibigay ng kundisyon diyan? Ito: nagtiwala ka sa iyong kaibigan **sa kundisyon na magiging katulad siya ng dati.**               \n\t\t+ Na muli niyang ipamamalas ang mga katangian na tinakda mo na sa kanya. At **mananatili** lamang ang iyong pagtitiwala sa kanya ==**hangga't** hindi ka niya bibiguin, **hangga't** hindi siya magbabago.==\n\t\t+ May mga kundisyon pala ang ganitong klaseng paniniwala; dahil may mga hangganan pa ito, sa isang paraan 'mahina' pa ito. Hindi pa ito 'buo' o walang pasubali.\n\t+ Tunay na **pagpapahiram** lamang ang nangyayari sa paniniwala at pagtitiwala na may mga kundisyon dahil ==kailangang **ibalik** sa iyo ang ipinagkatiwala mo== kapag ito'y nais mo nang hingin. *CREDIT*\n\t\t+ Sa pagpapahiram ng iyong sarili sa iba, inaasahan mo pa rin na ibalik nila ito sa iyo. At kung hindi nila ibalik--kung hindi ka nila iningatan--babawiin mo na ang paniniwala mo, puputulin ang tiwala.\n#### Kuro-kuro pa rin\n+ \"In the light of my previous remarks, however, isn‚Äôt it plain that ==**this vulnerability of my belief** is linked to the residue of opinion still left in it?== (p.136).\"\n+ **Marupok** **pa ang paniniwala o _credere_ na may tumpak na inaasahan mula sa isang Ikaw.**\n\t+ Ang **kundisyunal na paniniwala** ay madaling mawala o bawiin. Wala itong seguridad. Kaya hindi pa '**buo**' ang tiwala na siyang pundasyon ng paniniwala.\n\t+ Nakadepende ang pagpapatuloy (at pagtigil) ng paniniwalang ito sa kung anong posibleng mangyari sa hinaharap. Para bang laging nakabitin. Laging \"_wait and see._\" Gaya ito ng pagsabi sa isang taong mahal mo: \"I love you until further notice . . . .\"\n+ Kaya ang ganitong uri ng paniniwala ay **hindi pa dalisay na pananampalataya**. Sapagkat ayon kay Marcel, ==ang ganap na pananampalataya ay walang mga kundisyon.==\n### Dalisay na Pananampalataya\n#### Lektura\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D13sOKsjBiQ\n**Repetitio**\n+ Pag-ibig = pananampalataya\n+ *Fiat voluntas tua* (thy will be done)\n+ Imahen at kuro-kuro\n+ Paninidigan\n+ Pagtingin sa hinaharap\n+ Kundisyunal na paniniwala\n+ Pagtataya\n\n**Pananampalataya at Pag-ibig**\n+ espasyo\n+ pag-ibig na walang kundisyun: kahit masakit na, kahit hindi ka iniibig\n+ nagtatagal dahil may mga dahilan\n\t+ hal. nagkaktulad ng mga hilig, gawain\n\t+ Dahil XYZ\n+ Hamon: paano kung nagbago na siya?

It is the will of God that should be done in the world, not man's will, because God is the one who created the heavens and the earth, man, and everything else in it that has life. He is sovereign, and we are to submit to Him, not the other way around.\n#### Maikling Pagsusulit\nSa anong paraan katulad ng **walang kundisyon na pag-ibig** ang **dalisay na pananampalataya** ayon kay Marcel?\n\nkung kundisyunal, may hawak ka pa rin sa sarili (may kontrol)\n\"lord i give up my life for you\" song\nGod's plan\n\n1. Thesis: Unconditional love and true faith are alike in the way that you have to let go of control\n2. Bakit?\n\t1. Letting go of control means letting go of your expectations of the one of you love; being open to change; to whatever what happens. The basis of your love/faith should be the core self (pagkatao) of them.\n\t2. By holding people to our expectations, we imprison them. If we can't do this to a person, how can we do this to an all-powerful God?\n\t3. It's terrifying to love/believe in someone this way\n3. Conclusion: Faith is freeing\n\t1. it frees us from being blind (what conviction can do), opens us up to possibilities\n\t2. makes us ready for anything\n\t3. \"Peace and faith are inseparable\"; We are at peace because we trust that our lives are in God's hands\n\n\nThe similarity of both unconditional love and true faith is that you have to let go of control. \n\nWhat does this look like? When you let go of control, you let go of your expectations of the person you love or have faith in (e.g. they should respond to me, be nice and just, etc.). We free them from the conditions we set. This can be like a prison because this prevents others from being different from our concepts of them. Change is a natural part of life, so it's unfair to expect this of people. Thus, how can we expect this of God, who has no limits?\n\nFreeing people of our expectations ends up being freeing for us too. It frees us from blindness by opening us to possibilities: ones where we don't have to be in control all the time. This is why Marcel said \"Peace and faith are inseparable\"; there's no need to worry when you put your whole life in God's hands.\n\nMagkatulad ang walang kundisyon na pag-ibig at ang dalisay na pananampalataya dahil kailangan mo bitawan ng kontrol. \n\nAno ang hitsura nito? Kapag bitawan mo ang kontrol, binibitawan mo din ang pag-asa ng taong minamahal o nananampalataya (hal. dapat sila ay maging mabait at makatarungan, dapat palaging sila tumutugon sa akin, dapat walang masamang mangyari sa akin, atbp.). Makakalaya sila sa mga nakatakdang kundisyon: parang itong kulungan kasi pumipigil ito ng pagkakaiba sa pag-asa mo. Ang pagbabago ay isang bahagi ng buhay, kaya hindi patas paasahin sa mga ibang tao. Sa ganito, paano kami ginagawa ito sa Diyos? \n\nSa pagbibitaw ng kontrol, naranasan din ng kalayaan. Makakalaya kami sa pagkabulag dahil magiging bukas na kami sa iba't ibang posibilidad; paano kung hindi kami pala kailangan palaging bantayan o ingatan?  Kaya sinasabi ni Marcel ng \"Hindi mapaghihiwalay ang kapayapaan at pananampalataya\"; kapag inilagay ka sa buong buhay mo ang hawak ng Diyos, hindi na kailangan mag-alala.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.723605439Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2022-02-28":{"title":"2022-02-28","content":"## Theo 13\n### Man is called to a life of love\n#religion \n**Sources:**\n- Familiaris consortio 11-12\n- Scott Peck, The Meaning of Genuine Love\n#### 2.1 Man is the image of the God of love who created him\n- *Familaris consortio* traces the ==vocation/calling/design of man== to the fact that man is created in the image of God who is love\n\t- Explains how man is at his best when he does good\n- God inscribed in the humanity of man + woman ==the capacity \u0026 responsibility to love==\n\t- Love is not an optional capacity that man can choose to exercise\n\t- Love is a responsibility\n\t- If one chooses not to love, he is choosing to ignore his highest calling: realizing the image of God in whom he was created\n\t\t- A.K.A. path towards self-frustrtion and self-destruction\n- Man is called to love in his unified totality. Man's structure (man is an incarnate spirit ‚Äî a soul expressed in a body, a body informed by immortal spirit), called ==sacramental or symbol-meaning==, is **reflected in his significant acts.**\n\t- Love can't be shown with thoughts alone; this \"spiritual\" reality must be expressed\n\t- The material external expressions are made special and different from all other kisses and flowers because of the meaning behind them\n\t- External expressions do not exhaust the meaning, the spiritual reality\n- This contexts informs how *FC* says that **man must love in unified totality; sexual acts are not only biological**. The sexual act achieves its full human meaning when it is an integral + expressive part of love. ==Meaning = committed love==\n\t- The physical act would be a lie if it wasn't the fruit + sign of total personal self-giving, where we can see the whole person is present\n\n#### 2.2 The Meaning of Genuine Love\n- Working description: **Love is the will to extend oneself for the purpose of nurturing one's own and the other's spiritual growth**\n- 4 important elements/norms of this description of love (to help us discern if we're in a truly loving relationship)\n\t- Teological\n\t- Circular/Growth of Both Persons\n\t- Effort Norm\n\t- Will Norm\n- **Teological:** love is specified by the fruit that it bears, namely human maturity. \n\t- Love can be called genuine based on the ==\"long-term\" effect== it has:\n\t\t- Am I becoming a better person?\n\t\t- As a student/partner/child/orgmate, am I doing my responsibilities?\n\t- Some questions:\n\t\t- Do premarital sexual relations really mean genuine love?\n\t\t- What does a controlling partner indicate (e.g. spend all time together, cut relations with others)?\n\t\t- What effect does my relationship have on my other responsibilities?\n\t\t- There are various forms and degrees of emotional \"blackmail\"\n\t\t- Why can't I have more than one girlfriend? I have enough love!\n- **Circular/Growth of Both Persons:** if the relationship is genuinely loving, it must result in the growth of both persons. \n\t- Can't be loving if one is growing at the expense of another (e.g. professionally)\n\t- A legitimate love of self exists (e.g. a person would like to improve himself, exercise and keep healthy, live his faith) \n\t- Difference between sacrifice and self-sacrifice\n\t\t- **Sacrifice:** giving up something less for something more\n\t\t- **Self-sacrifice:** giving up something more important for something less \n\t\t\t- E.G. Your dignity to avoid fighting\n\t- ==Genuine love requires sacrifice, it excludes self-sacrifice==\n\t- The fallacy of **\"I must learn to love myself first before I can love others\"**\n\t\t- Assumes that love of another is a mere overflow of love of self\n\t\t- Another form: how can I give love if I don't have it?\n\t\t- ==To love is to grow.== To grow is to be responsible for another.\n\t\t- Love of self is possible only through love of another; love of another is possible only through love of self\n\t\t- Why? ==To love myself, I need to extend my ego boundaries; to do this, I must be concerned with and care for another.==\n\t\t- Loving myself and loving another is simultaneous, not sequential\n\t- Genuine love should be self-replenishing, meaningful, fulfilling; it should bring joy and happiness over the long term\n\t\t- E.G. parents find joy in the happiness and success of their children\n\t\t- Counters claims of those who say \"Now is the time to love myself\" after spending all their loves allegedly loving others\n- **The Effort Norm:** a genuinely loving relationship should be driven and fuelled by effort; it should not simply run on emotion.\n\t- If the latter, it's easy to give up and move on to the next pleasurable experience. It cannot last\n\t- Pleasurable relationships are idealized; you are not looking at the person, ==you are focusing on the pleasure you derive from the encounter==\n\t\t- You may even be projecting your idea of her on her instead of getting to really know her\n\t- Consider:\n\t\t- E.G. beginning of relationship is rosy, pleasurable, immediately rewarding. doesn't take that much effort.\n\t\t- Compare relationship based on occasion v.s. one that is pursued E.G. bf-gf in same college v.s. bf-gf in different countries, companies, timezones\n\t- **The Will Norm:** love is not mere feelings; it's also an act of the will, a decision\n\t\t- conventional wisdom and language identify love w/ feelings\n\t\t- but feelings come and go. we cannot control them; therefore, we can't depend on them to be the ==foundation of a stable relationship==\n\t\t- feelings are not human, but ==instincts== until we decide to \"own\" them and act on them\n\t\t\t- E.G. tics, sexual arousal\n\t\t- Genuine love as an act of the will recognizes ==prior responsibilities \u0026 commitments.==\n\t\t\t- You may be drawn towards another person (feelings), but you can say but I am already a committed person and must not give in to the feeling (will, decision)\n\t- **Psuedo-love:** examples of what can be mistaken for genuine love\n\t\t- **Falling-in-love:** emphasizes strong feelings; immortalized in fairy tales, love songs, and poems. Blinds reason + dulls will\n\t\t- **Dependency:** misleading. when someone depends on me, it emphasizes \"being needed\" and relates w/ the \"feeling\" that you are important to the person to whom you are strongly attracted. But this can eventually become unhealthy\n\t\t\t- Dependency here means that one cannot exist/survive without the assurance that he/she is cared for \u0026 supported by the other, even for the most basic things in life\n\t\t\t- Makes relationship taxing, draining, and burdensome\n\t\t\t- In this type of relationship, one is focused only on his/her own, and not the other; ==not interested to grow; the focus is on the self==\n\t\t- **Cathexis:** attachment and care for things, best exemplified in love for pets. We can only love human beings (distinct from pets) because only they ==possess a spirit capable of substantial spiritual growth== \n\t\t\t-  Since communication w/ pets is limited, we end up projecting onto them our own thoughts and feelings \n\t\t\t- ^ This leads to an emotional closeness which may not correspond to reality\n\t\t\t- Pets are only satisfactory if their wills concide w/ ours (e.g. obedience schools)\n\t\t\t- We seek to foster dependency in our pets; we don't want them to grow up and leave. ==We value their attachment, not their independence.==\n\t\t- **Self-sacrifice:** exemplified in the \"martyr\" wife who tolerates all abuse from husband; the more she tolerates, the more she feels she loves her husband.\n\t\t\t- In the process, she \"encourages\" the husband to abuse her and he does not grow, and the martyr wife doles not derive the joy and satisfaction from her relationship\n#### Reflection 2 \n##### Notes\n- siguro i can link to bell hooks and the monk's discussion: https://www.lionsroar.com/bell-hooks-and-thich-nhat-hanh-on-building-a-community-of-love/\n\t- maybe i can link to social justice to self-sacrifice? e.g. dignity for the sake of peace\n\t- link to Ateneo theologicans making a stand\n- i want to talk about the circular/growth norm and trauma...reminds me of parents lol\n- **Remember:**\n\t- focus on 1 point and where you got it\n\t- why is it important\n\t- why did it change the way you view things\n\n###### Quotes\n\n\u003e Perhaps the most common false assumption about love is that ==love means we will not be challenged or changed.== No doubt this is why people who read writing about racism, sexism, homophobia, religion, etc. that challenges their set assumptions tend to see that work as harsh rather than loving.\n\n\u003e Indeed, in this world all efforts to end domination, to bring peace and justice, were spiritual practice.\n\n\u003e ==between self or no-self there is no real separation.== Anything you do for yourself you do for the society at the same time. And anything you do for society you do for yourself also. That insight is very powerfully made in the practice of no-self.\n\u003e \n\u003e I think one of the most wonderful books that Martin Luther King wrote was _Strength to Love_. I always liked it because of the word ‚Äústrength,‚Äù which counters the Western notion of love as easy. Instead, Martin Luther King said that ==you must have courage to love, that you have to have a profound will to do what is right to love, that it does not come easy.==\n\n\u003e We may think that justice is everyone being equal, having the same rights, sharing the same kind of advantages, but maybe we have not had the chance to look at the nature of justice in terms of no-self. That kind of justice is based on the idea of self, but it may be very interesting to ==explore justice in terms of no-self.==\n\n\u003e Sometimes in life all things are not equal, so what does it mean to have justice when there is no equality? A parent can be just towards a child, even though they‚Äôre not equal.\n\n\u003e Justice is possible without equality, I believe, because of compassion and understanding. If I have compassion, then if I have more than you, which is unequal, I will still do the just thing by you.\n\n\u003e You want to be human. Be angry, it‚Äôs okay. But not to practice is not okay. To be angry, that is very human. And to learn how to smile at your anger and make peace with your anger is very nice. That is the whole thing‚Äîthe meaning of the practice, of the learning. ==By taking a look at your anger it can be transformed into the kind of energy that you need‚Äîunderstanding and compassion. It is with negative energy that you can make the positive energy.== A flower, although beautiful, will become compost someday, but if you know how to transform the compost back into the flower, then you don‚Äôt have to worry. ==You don‚Äôt have to worry about your anger because you know how to handle it‚Äîto embrace, to recognize, and to transform it.== So this is what is possible.\n\n\u003e We oppress ourselves by holding on to anger. My students tell me, we don‚Äôt want to love! We‚Äôre tired of being loving! And I say to them, ==if you‚Äôre tired of being loving, then you haven‚Äôt really been loving, because when you are loving you have more strength.== As you were telling us yesterday, we grow stronger in the act of loving.\n\n\u003e ==Fear is born from ignorance.== We think that the other person is trying to take away something from us. But if we look deeply, we see that the desire of the other person is exactly our own desire‚Äîto have peace, to be able to have a chance to live. So if you realize that the other person is a human being too, and you have exactly the same kind of spiritual path, and then the two can become good practitioners. This appears to be practical for both.\n\n\u003e ==The only answer to fear is more understanding.== And there is no understanding if there is no effort to look more deeply to see what is there in our heart and in the heart of the other person. The Buddha always reminds us that our afflictions, including our fear and our desiring, are born from our ignorance. That is why in order to dissipate fear, we have to remove wrong perception.\n\n\u003e They need community to remind them. Sometimes you have a flash of insight, but it‚Äôs not strong enough to survive. Therefore in the practice of Buddhism, ==_samadhi_ is the power to maintain insight alive in every moment, so that every speech, every word, every act will bear the nature of that insight.== It is a question of cleaning. And you clean better if you are surrounded by sangha‚Äîthose who are practicing exactly the same.\n\n\u003e  I think that ==we best realize love in community.==\n\n###### Outline\n\n1. Point that struck me the most: the difference between sacrifice and self-sacrifice\n\t1. Got this from the circular norm, which states that a relationship can only be genuinely loving if it results in the growth of both persons\n\t2. Why is it important? \n\t\t1. It shows me that love requires courage. Why? It doesn't come easy (effort norm), and you need to have a profound will to do what is right to love (will norm)\n\t\t2. I see this relevant to social justice\n2. Expound on example: Discussion between author \u0026 activist bell hooks and Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh on building a community of love\n\t1. Most common false assumption about love: love means we will not be challenged/changed\n\t\t1. 2 unhealthy perspectives:\n\t\t\t1. People who don't want to be challenged: this is what leads people who read social \u0026 cultural criticism, which challenges their set assumptions, as harsh instead of loving E.G. parents, relatives who prefer to remain apolitical/don't like engaging in political discussions\n\t\t\t2. People who are full of anger e.g. movements that call for violence \u0026 resistance; \"loving your enemies\" is seen as weak\n\t2. 1st counter\n\t\t1. Scott peck: Love is ‚Äúthe will to extend one‚Äôs self for the purpose of nurturing one‚Äôs own or another‚Äôs spiritual growth\"\n\t\t2. To love is to grow. To grow is to be responsible for another. Challenge is required for growth.\n\t\t3. E.G. taking a stand. arguing w/ parents \u0026 relatives on politics\n\t\t\t1. If I decide to remain silent for the sake of peace, it would be self-sacrifice. My dignity would be destroyed.\n\t\t\t2. My parents \u0026 relatives wouldn't be able to grow as people. If I truly loved them, I must be concerned for their growth.\n\t3. 2nd counter\n\t\t1. Thich Nhat Hanh: between the self and no-self, there is no separation. Anything you do for yourself you do for society at the same time, and vice versa \n\t\t2. Being angry is very human. But when we hold on to anger, we oppress ourselves.\n\t\t\t1. E.G. negative feelings like discrimination, superiority/inferiority complex lead to suffering\n\t\t\t2. path of self-destruction, because its our responsibility to love\n\t\t\t3. also self-sacrifice: you destroy yourself just to hold on to anger...and in turn destroy others \n\t\t3. Instead, we should transform this anger into understanding and compassion. This is what it means to love your enemies.\n\t\t4.

Ilagay din ang pinagkunan (_source_) ng larawan na ito bilang _caption_.\n\n- Imahen: unlimited credit card\n\t- If we see praying as a time for only requesting for God, the image we'd be seeing of God is of a credit card\n\t- Here's what I learned of credit cards reserved for the elite:\n\t\t- no credit limit\n\t\t- personal concierge who can get you anything you want\n\t- How this applies to God:\n\t\t- we see him as our personal concierge who can get us anything we want\n\t\t- E.G. petition, forgiveness, intercession for others\n- Implikasyon\n\t- we put God in a prison of our concept of him....limited by what is concrete\n\t- we attempt to do this to someone who cannot be defined, who is beyond understanding\n\t- we set ourselves up for dissapointment when we don't get what we want (negatibong karanasan)\n\nIf we see praying as a time only for requesting from God, then our image of God would be a special credit card. For example, the American Express Centurion Black card (which is reserved for the richest) offers users no credit limit and a personal concierge who can get you anything that you want. Similar to this, we see God as a \"card\" for getting all our endless desires: forgiveness, petition, and intercession.\n\nWhen one has this understanding of prayer, they put God in a prison of concrete concepts. However, God cannot be defined this way because he is beyond understanding. So, we end up setting ourselves for disappointment because we don't always get what we want in life. \n\nKung nauunawaan natin ang pagdasal bilang pakakataon lamang upang humiling sa Diyos, ang larawang ipinagpapalagay natin sa Diyos ay isang natatanging *credit card*. Halimbawa, ito ang naghahandog ng American Express Centurion Black card (nakalaan para sa pinakamayaman): walang limitasyon at isang katulong. Katulad nito, nakikita kami ng Diyos bilang paraan para makuha ng gusto natin: paghingi ng tawad at petisyon. \n\nKung ito ang ating pagkakakaunawaan sa pagdasal, nilagay kami ng Diyos sa isang kulungan ng konkretong konsepto. Gayunman, dahil ang Diyos ay walang hanggan, hindi siya nagkakasya sa depinisyon namin. Sa huli, itinakda namin ang aming sarili para sa pagkabigo kasi hindi kami palagi nagkukuha ng gusto natin sa buhay (negatibong karanasan).\n\n\n\n#### Hiling-Tanggap at Tawag-Tugon\n![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20220301134123.png]]\n\n- Kung ang isang dasal ay walang iba kundi ang paghiling na may pagtingin sa sariling mga interes ng nagdarasal, ang dasal ay masasabing nauuwi sa **ekonomikal na lohika** ng **paghiling at pagtanggap**.\n\t- material gyorl\n- **Dalisay na palangain:** pure prayer\n- Tugon ni Kristo:\n\u003e \"Ama, sambahin nawa ang iyong pangalan.

At huwag mo kaming hayaang matukso.\"\n- Pansinin na nariyan sa \"Ama Namin\" ang mga 'elemento ng dasal' na binanggit ni Westphal\n- At sa pangkaraniwang pag-unawa natin, nalalaman natin na ang isang ama, bilang isang magulang, ay ==nagbibigay-kalinga *(giving care)* sa kanyang mga anak.== \n- Pero pansinin mo lamang na sa tinuro ni Kristo na dasal, ang maaari mo raw hingin/hilingin sa Diyos Ama ay ang ==pang-araw-araw mong makakain.==\n\t- Tahimik ang dasal na ito tungkol sa ibang bagay na ninanais natin para sa ating sarili gaya, halimbawa, ng matataas na grado, na magkaroon ng magandang trabaho, atbp.\n\n##### Ako-Ikaw\n- hindi naman talaga natin 'maiaalis' ang ating sarili sa pagdarasal\n- Ang _akto_ ng pagdarasal ay akto o kilos ng isang **ako**\n\t- kasangkot ang sarili sa kanyang dalangin kahit sa payak *(simple)* na dahilan na nagmumula ito sa kanya\n- nakatuon *(depend/lean?)* at tumutungo *(focus)* pa rin ang mga binibigkas ng siyang nagdarasal sa isang **Ikaw** na dinarasalan. \n- Kaya masasabing may dalawang panig¬†sa istruktura ng dasal: may **ako** na nagdarasal at may dinarasalang **Ikaw**. \n\t- Tanggalin mo ang isa, hindi na dasal iyon\n- Kaya ano ba itong sinasabi ni Westphal na ang dasal ay nagmumula sa isang \"decentered self,\" o sarili na wala sa sentro? \n\t- Hindi ibig sabihin nito na bigla na lamang mawawala o maglalaho ang siyang nagdarasal; kung ganoong ang nangyari, ==Diyos na lang ang matitira doon at wala nang dasal.==\n- Ang tinutukoy lamang ng \"decentered self\" ay ang ==**isang sarili na hindi na makasarili** kung saan ang Diyos ay isinasantabi o nawawala sa dasal.==\n\t- Sa madaling salita, ang \"decentered self\" na ito ay isang **sarili na para-sa-iba**.\n- Ang tawag ng palaisip na si [Emmanuel Levinas (Links to an external site.)](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/levinas/) sa siyang **ibang-iba** sa sarili ay **_l'autre_**\n\t-  ang _l'autre_ o ang **Iba** (_the other_) ay ang siyang labas sa akin (_exteriority_)\n\t- sa ganitong paraan, hindi siya isang bagay na maaari kong gawing obheto ng kaalaman o magsilbing pamamaraan upang makamit ang aking mga hangarin (_irreducible_)\n\t- Ganoon na lamang ang kaibahan niya sa akin na sa isang paraan mas 'mataas' o nakahihigit siya sa akin (_transcendence_).\n\t- Hal. sa iyong kapuwa-tao, nauunawaan mo na siya ay may sariling dangal, kalayaan, at halaga na hindi mo mawawari o masusukat. \n\t\t- Sa ganyang paraan, para kay Levinas ==**walang hangganan** ang _l'autre._== Lumalagpas siya sa iyong pag-unawa at mga kapangyarihan.\n- Tesis ni Westphal: tinatanggal ng isang tao ang kanyang sarili mula sa sentro, at ipinagpapaliban ang kanyang sarling mga interes.\n\u003e \". . . prayer is a deep, quite possibly the deepest **decentering of the self**, deep enough to begin dismantling or, if you like, deconstructing **that burning preoccupation with myself**,\" p.15).\n\n##### Tawag-Tugon\n- Paano magaganap itong pagtanggal sa sentro ng sarili?\n\t- Ito ay sa pamamagitan ng isang karansan ng *kenosis:* nangangahulugan na =='tanggalin ang laman'==; sa kaso na pinag-uusapan natin, ang 'tinatanggal' o isinasantabi ng siyang nagdarasal ay ==ang kanyang mga sariling pagnanais, kahilingan, at kagustuhan.==\n\t- Ang isang pangkaraniwang pagkakataon kung kailan nalilimutan natin ang ating sarili ay kapag ==may pumukaw *(open)* ng ating pansin.==\n\t\t- Maaaring dahil kakaiba ito, hindi mo kilala, hindi mo nauunawaan, o 'di kaya'y ginulat ka gaya ng isang sorpresa na hindi mo inaasahan.\n- Sa ibang pagkakataon, ang pinakasimpleng pangyayari na nilalalayo tayo mula sa ating sarili ay kapag may tumawag sa atin--lalo na kung tinatawag tayo gamit ang ating pangalan.

By this holiness, a more human way of life is promoted even this earthly society.\n1. All Christians are called to the fullness of Christian life, not just priests...but ==all Christians==\n2. But not only Christians to the exclusion of everyone else\n3. But the statement was to correct a popular misunderstanding that priests, religious ppl, etc. more than lay, have a more stringent obligation to be holy\n4. Holiness promotes ==a more human way of life== even in this earthly society. Holiness does not take us away from our human responsibilities. Holiness is not escaping or fleeing from the \"world\".\n\n##### 3.1.2 There are various types and duties of life, but only one holiness\nE.G. marriage, religious life, priesthood, single blessedness\n- No \"type\" is \"better\" than another, or a surer way to heaven\n- Christian holiness is not a road parallel to one's ordinary life and work\n- Holiness is achieved in and through ==one's state of life==, through the concrete circs andd events\n\n##### 3.1.3 Holiness\n- CCC: ==holiness is the fullness of Christian life and the perfection of charity==\n\t- by doing the will of the Father in everything (the good I know in conscience if I don't believe in God), Christians may devote themselves wholeheartedly to:\n\t\t-  the glory of God\n\t\t- the service of neighbor\n- The self-realization of the Christian: ==love==, which is found in all of his diverse acts; it is the fulfillment of the law, and includes the fulfillment of other precepts\n\t- Only love can assign man completely to God because ==only love binds the multiplicity of his being into inner unity, dedicating it to God==\n\t- It is in ==loving (and doing the good)== that man attains holiness, that he becomes most  fully himself.\n\n#### Gauudete et exsultate\n- Holiness: often associated with beatified and canonized people...this shouldn't be the case\n- Pope Francis: ==\"saints next door\"==, people struggling against many temptations to lead a  life of love.\n- Holiness is associated with martyrs and virgins and people who  lived difficult and ascetic lives. But it does not have to be. We can be ==‚Äúmiddle class‚Äù saints.==\n- God saves us and makes us holy, not as isolated individuals without any bond between them, but as a ==people in a community. ==\n\t- God draws us to himself taking into account the complex fabric of interpersonal relationships present in a human community.\n- Holiness is present in ==ordinary circumstances==, in the patience of  people‚Äîin parents who raise their children with love, in men and  women who work hard to provide for their families, in the elderly  who do not lose their smile‚Äîthey reflect God‚Äôs presence.\n- The decisive turning points in world history as in one‚Äôs personal life, are substantially codetermined by souls not mentioned in history books.\n\t- We will only find out about those people to whom we owe the decisive turning points in our personal lives on the day when all that is hidden is revealed.\n- There are many stories and testimonies of holy lives, but what we need to do is to discern ==‚Äúmy path, the path to which God is calling me,‚Äù== \n\t- there is not only one but many paths to holiness, the path that will bring out the best in me, in each person. It is not a ‚Äúone size fits all.‚Äù \n\t- God‚Äôs life  is communicated to some in one way and to others in another.\n- Holiness is not withdrawal from the world to spend time in prayer.  We are called to holiness by ==living our lives (including its duties and responsibilities) with love.==\n\t- Be holy by living and caring for your spouse; be holy by laboring with integrity and skill in the service of others; be holy by exercising authority for the common good.\n- A Christian cannot think of ==his/her mission on earth== without seeing it as a ==path to holiness.==\n\t- Each saint is a mission to reflect and embody at a specific moment in history, a certain aspect of the gospel (e.g. Blessed Carlo Acutis)\n- Holiness is nothing else than ==charity/love lived to the full.==  \n\t- ‚ÄúThe measure of our holiness stems from the stature that Christ achieves in us, to the extent that, by the power of the Holy Spirit, we model our whole life on his.\n-   To recognize the word that the Lord wishes to speak to us through one of his saints, we need not get caught in the details. We must look at the ==totality of their lives, their entire journey of growth in holiness.==\n-   It is not healthy to love silence while fleeing interaction with others, to want peace and quiet while avoiding activity, to seek prayer while disdaining service. ==Everything can be accepted and integrated into our life and become part of our path to holiness.==\n\t- Hypocrisy\n- This does not mean ignoring the need for moments of quiet, solitude, and silence before God.\n\t- We all realize the need to stop this ==rat race== and to recover the ==personal space== needed to carry on a ==heartfelt dialogue== with God.\n- Holiness does not take away ==energy, vitality, or joy.==\n\t- Relate to Scott Peck? Love is self-nourishing\n\t- On the  contrary, we will become what the Father had in mind when he  created us, and we will be faithful to our deepest self.\n- ==To depend on God== sets us free from enslavement and leads us to recognize our great dignity.\n\t- enslavement to manmade ideals? like hustle culture\n- To the extent that each Christian grows in holiness, he/she will bear ==greater fruit for our world.==\n- Holiness does not make you less human, since it is an ==encounter between your weakness and the power of God‚Äôs grace.==\n\n### Conclusion and Nexus\n- **Theological anthropology:** call to do the good, call to a life of love, call to a life of holiness.\n- That **man becomes most fully himself** when he does the good, when he loves, when he lives a life of holiness.\n-   **Marriage**, as a committed, loving, responsible relationship is ==one way to live this life==; and for many (most?), it is THE way.\n\t- shouldn't be the case!\n\n### Writing\n#### Notes\n- workaholism? and christianity? \n- Gauudete et exsultate\n\t- Holiness does not take away energy, vitality or joy\n\t- To depend on God sets us free from enslavement, leading us to recognize our great dignity\n\t- Everything can be accepted and integrated with our lives on our path to holiness...nothing has to be neglected (e.g. relationships)\n\t- We all realize the need to stop this ==rat race== and to recover the ==personal space== needed to carry on a ==heartfelt dialogue== with God.\n- Revolutionary Work\n\t- Our creation in the image of God tells us that work is _good_. The effects of sin and the curse remind us that work is _grim_.\n\t\t- E.G. Job well done v.s. painful and frustrating toil\n\t- work as God‚Äôs gift because of our stewardship role in creation\n\t- all vocations are equal and we should not call one as ‚Äúspecial‚Äù\n- **Every Good Endeavor**\n\t- \"...our work can be a calling only if it is reimagined as a mission of service to something beyond merely our own interests. ==Thinking of work mainly as a means of self-fulfillment and self-realization slowly crushes a person.==\"\n\t- ‚ÄúEveryone will be forgotten, nothing we do will make any difference, and all good endeavours, even the best, will come to naught. Unless there is God. If the God of the Bible exists, and there is a True Reality beneath and behind this one, and this life is not the only life, then ==every good endeavour, even the simplest ones, pursued in response to God's calling, can matter forever.==‚Äù\n\t- ‚ÄúSo when we say that Christians work from a gospel worldview, it does not mean that they are constantly speaking about Christian teaching in their work. Some people think of the gospel as something we are principally to ‚Äúlook at‚Äù in our work. This would mean that Christian musicians should play Christian music, Christian writers should write stories about conversion, and Christian businessmen and -women should work for companies that make Christian-themed products and services for Christian customers. Yes, some Christians in those fields would sometimes do well to do those things, but it is a mistake to think that the Christian worldview is operating only when we are doing such overtly Christian activities. Instead, ==think of the gospel as a set of glasses through which you ‚Äúlook‚Äù at everything else in the world.== Christian artists, when they do this faithfully, will not be completely beholden either to profit or to naked self-expression; and they will tell the widest variety of stories. Christians in business will see profit as only one of several bottom lines; and they will work passionately for any kind of enterprise that serves the common good. The Christian writer can constantly be showing the destructiveness of making something besides God into the central thing, even without mentioning God directly.‚Äù\n\t- ‚Äú==all human work (especially excellent work), done by all people, as a channel of God‚Äôs love for his world.== They will be able to appreciate and rejoice in their own work, whether it is prestigious or not, as well as in the skillful work of all other people, whether they believe or not. So this biblical conception of work‚Äîas a vehicle for God‚Äôs loving provision for the world‚Äù\n\t- ‚ÄúBecoming a Christian is a lot like moving to a new country; only it is more profound, because it gives us a new perspective on every culture, every worldview, and every field of work. In the long run, the gospel helps us see everything in a new light, but it takes time to grasp and incorporate this new information into how we live and pursue our vocations. And we can be sure that this ultimate learning experience will never truly end; we are told the angels themselves never tire of looking into the gospel to see new wonders (1 Peter 1:10‚Äì12).‚Äù\n\t- \"[Work] must play its proper role, ==subservient to God.== It must regularly give way not just to work stoppage for bodily repair but also to joyful reception of the world and of ordinary life.‚Äù\n\t- ‚Äúwork is not, primarily, a thing one does to live, but the thing one lives to do. It is, or it should be, the full expression of the worker‚Äôs faculties¬†.¬†.¬†. ==the medium in which he offers himself to God.‚Äù==\n\t- ‚ÄúWork is not all there is to life. You will not have a meaningful life without work, but you cannot say that your work is the meaning of your life. ==If you make any work the purpose of your life‚Äîeven if that work is church ministry‚Äîyou create an idol that rivals God.== Your relationship with God is the most important foundation for your life, and indeed it keeps all the other factors‚Äîwork, friendships and family, leisure and pleasure‚Äîfrom becoming so important to you that they become addicting and distorted.‚Äù\n\n#### Draft?\n**Outline:**\n1. Point that struck me the most: \"Holiness does not take away energy, vitality, or joy...we will become what the Father had in mind when he created us, and we will be faithful to our deepest self.\"\n\t1. Where I found it: Gaudete et exsultate: \"More Alive, More Human\"\n\t\t1. can be linked to \"Activity that Sanctifies\"\n\t2. Why it's important to me: reminds us not to idolize work; relevant today, where hustle culture is prevalent\n2. Expound on Every Good Endeavor: the Christian view of work can serve as the foundation of a thriving and balanced life\n\t1. What happens when we idolize work?\n\t\t1. We get burnt out...energy, vitality, and joy zapped away from us because we neglect our health, relationships, etc.\n\t\t2. Because of selfishness: \"Thinking of work mainly as a means of self-fulfillment and self-realization slowly crushes a person.\"\n\t\t\t1. Work takes a toil on the body...it's not supposed be fulfilling in of itself\n\t\t\t2. Work alone is pointless...our lives are so short\n\t2. Christian view of work will free us from being enslaved by work; this will lead us to true holiness, helping us become our fullest selves...\n\t\t1. We are given purpose\n\t\t\t1. Finding fulfillment in serving God...self-nourishing\n\t\t\t2. With God, every good endeavor can matter forever... (meaning outside our lives)\n\t\t2. the more holy you are, the greater fruit you bear for our world\n\t\t\t1. you are not optimal when you are burnt out\n3. How can I act better?\n\t1. [Work] must play its proper role, ==subservient to God.== It must regularly give way not just to work stoppage for bodily repair but also to joyful reception of the world and of ordinary life.‚Äù\n\t2. Don't neglect your health and the world \n\t\t1. Everything can be accepted and integrated into our life and become part of our path to holiness.\n\t3.

The theology revolves around the notion of **God as one who speaks** or, better, as the **One who speaks**; for Mary is no ontotheologian, and God is not so much First Cause as **First Speaker**, the **One whose word is always the beginning**. Here ‚Äò‚Äòbeginning‚Äô‚Äô signifies not a Self-Explanatory Explainer in terms of which everything can be made transparent and intelligible but rather the fact that ==**before I speak**, or **act**, or even **am**, **God has always already spoken**== (p. 21).\n\n- Ayon kay Westphal, matatagpuan raw sa _fiat_ ni Maria ang isang uri ng **teolohiya** at **etika.**\n\t- Ang **teolohiya**, muli, sa payak nitong kahulugan ay sinusubukang bigkasin kung ano ang **malalaman** (galing sa '_logos_') natin sa **Diyos** (_theos_). \n\t- At para raw kay Maria, ang Diyos ay isang Diyos na nagsasalita (\"One who speaks\"). \n\t- Sa halip na magkaroon ng **pilosopikal na konsepto** sa Diyos (gaya, halimbawa, na Siya ay \"First Cause\" o sanhi ng lahat; o kaya \"Supreme Being,\" na nangangahulugang ang pag-iral niya ay nakahihigit sa lahat ng iba pang pag-iral, atbp.), ang Diyos ay maituturing na **Unang Tagapagsalita** (\"First Speaker\"). \n- Gaya ng nakita natin sa dasal ni Samuel, sa dasal din ni Maria ang Diyos ay nakikilala sa kanyang Salita. At sa pamamagitan ng kanyang **Salita** ==Siya **tumatawag** sa tao== (sa kaso ni Samuel) o ==nagpapahayag ng kung ano ang Kanyang **niloloob**.==\n- Kung ang Diyos nga ay makikilala sa pamamagitan ng kanyang Salita, bumabalik tayo sa hamon *(challenge)* at suliranin *(problem)* kung **paano ba ito maririnig sa pagdarasal?**\n\t- Paano ba maririnig itong Diyos na tumatawag sa isang tao habang nananatili sa kanyang katahimikan din? \n\t- Paano nga ba maririnig ang tawag ng Diyos (kung mayroon man) na nagpapahayag ng kanyang kalooban kung saan sa pangkaraniwang buhay ng isang tao marahil inuuna niya ang kanyang mga hangarin *(current? desire)*, ninanais *(past? desire)*, nilalayon *(objective)*?\n- Mailalapat din ang suliranin na ito kahit sa hindi naniniwala sa Diyos. \n\t- Kung babalikan natin si Levinas (na muli, siyang sinusundan din ni Westphal), ang **tawag ng iba** **o ng aking kapuwa** ay ang **tawag** sa akin na managot para sa kanila. \n\t- Ang kapuwa ko kung gayon, una sa lahat ay **nagsasalita** rin sa pamamagitan ng kanyang tawag. Tinatawag ako ng iba na magkaroon ng pananagutan ('_responsibility_') sa kanila na mangyayari lamang kung nakikinig ako sa tawag nila na isantabi ko ang aking sarili upang tumugon sa kanila. \n\t- Ang isang tao na inuuna ang kapakanan *(kalagayan; welfare)* ng iba ay isang tao na w==ala na sa sentro ng kanyang buhay==; may pagbabagong nagaganap din sa kanya ayon kay Levinas, kung saan ang sarili niya ay hindi na isang **sarili-na-maka-sarili** ngunit isang ==**sarili-na-para-sa-iba**.==\n- Ngunit ang suliranin, muli, ay paano ba **maririnig ang tahimik na tawag ng aking kapwa kung ang isang tao ay inuuna ang sarili niyang mga pakay at mga pagnanais?**\n\n### \"Narito ako\"\n- Ang Diyos at ang Iba (_l'autre_), bagaman may walang-hanggang pagkakaiba, ay may pagkakatulad pa rin.\n\t- Reminder: alterity = \"the state of being other/different; otherness\"\n- Ayon kay [Jacques Derrida](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/derrida/), sa ganang ibang-iba sa akin (_alterity_) ang Diyos at ang aking kapuwa, sila ay parehong ==tumatawag sa akin na magkaroon ng mga hangarin na lagpas na sa aking sarili.== \n\t- Nangunguna ang tawag ng Diyos gaya rin na nangunguna ng tawag ng aking kapuwa. \n\t- Ang tanong na lamang ay kung naririnig at tutugon ang isang tao sa tawag na ito.\n- Anong uri ng tugon sa Diyos ang matatagpuan sa binigkas ni Maria? Gaya ni Samuel, ang tugon din ni Maria sa anghel ay ==\"Narito ako na lingkod ng Panginoon\"== (Lucas 1:38). \n\t- Bagaman nalito at marahil natakot din siya sa binalita sa kanya ni Gabriel, ==hinandog niya pa rin ang kanyang sarili.==\n- Ngunit hindi simpleng paghahandog ng sarili ang ginawa niya. Tandaan, binigkas niya ang mga salitang iyan **pagkatapos** sabihin sa kanya ang mga mangyayari sa buhay niya na napagpasiyahan na ng Diyos. \n\t- 'Di gaya ni Samuel na nagsabi ng \"Narito ako\" **bago** malaman ang niloloob ng Diyos, sinabi ni Maria ang kanyang \"Narito ako\" nang may katiyakan na ==magbabago ang buhay niya sa isang paraan na hindi niya man lang naisip.==\n\t- Bagaman marahil hindi niya lubusang naunawaan ang dahilan kung **bakit** siya ang pinili ng Diyos, at bagaman hindi niya naintindihan kung **paano** magaganap ang niloloob ng Diyos na isisilang niya ang Anak ng Diyos habang siya'y isang dalaga--hindi pa rin tumalikod si Maria. \n- Sa kanyang \"Narito ako,\" hinahandog niya ang kanyang sarili at pinakitang handa siyang tuparin ang niloloob ng Diyos. Iyan ang kanyang akto ng ==paghahandog ng sarili o \"self-presentation\"==:\n\n\u003e She understands that God is here, unusually so in the **present** instance, and the only question is whether I am willing and able to be here too. [. . .] She also understands that ==**to be present to God**, she must turn away from the world in which she has been immersed.== Not that there is something evil about the world, into which, in fact, God will send her back with a task. It is rather that apart from that turning, ==the world is defined by her agenda, however innocent, and not God‚Äôs== (p.22).\n\n- Nagsisimula ang lahat sa ==pagpapakita o presentasyon ng ating sarili. ==\n\t- Madali kasing talikuran ang tawag ng iba at magtago. Maaari kang magkunwari na hindi mo ito narinig. Maaari mo ring sabihin na akala mo iba ang tinatawag.\n- Halimbawa: sa mga pagkakataon na maraming nasalanta ng bagyo at may _call for donations_ na ginawa ang lokal na gobyerno, o ng Ateneo, o ng ibang institusyon, maaari mong isiping hindi para sa iyo ang tawag na iyon: _Marami namang **iba** na tutulong, kaya hindi kailangang ako_. _Marami namang mayroong higit na kakayahan at kapasidad na tumulong sa mga nasalanta, kaya hindi kailangang ako ang tumulong._ \n\t- At habang maaaring totoo nga ito, at habang marami nga tayong makatuwirang dahilan kung bakit may ilang pagkakataon na hindi tayo tumutugon sa tawag ng iba, ==ang hindi pa rin natin maitatanggi ay **narinig** natin ang tawag ng iba.==\n- Ang ibig kong sabihin ay ito: ==Totoong may tawag.== Lagi't laging may tumatawag. Tumugon man tayo ng **Oo** o **Hindi** sa tawag na ito, at kahit magbingi-bingihan tayo sa tawag na ito, nananatili pa ring totoo ang tawag. Ibang bagay na nga lamang kung handa tayong sabihing \"Narito ako.\"\n\n### \"Belonging\" at \"Disponibilite\"\n#### Pagiging-sa-Diyos\n- Buod:\n\t- Pansinin na tila may dagdag tayong makikitang aspeto ng **pananampalataya** sa pagturing ni Maria sa sarili niya (\"self-identification,\" p.22) bilang lingkod ng Diyos. \n\t- Para kay Maria, ang pagiging lingkod ng Diyos ay **pagiging-_sa-_Diyos** (_to belong to God_). \n\t- Gamit si Marcel, ayon kay Westphal ang tila ipinapahayag ni Maria sa Diyos ay \"_I belong to you_.\" \n\t- At ang pagiging-_sa-_Diyos na ito ay hindi kinakailangang isipin bilang pagmamay-ari lamang ng isang bagay (_possession_) na maaari mong itapon (\"disposable,\" p.23) kung hindi mo na kailangan.\n- Gaya ng maaaring unawain na hindi pang-aalipin ang pagiging lingkod ng isang tao sa isang panginoon na tinuturing niyang mabuti, ang **pagiging-sa-Diyos** ng isang tao ay nangangahulugan na ==**malayang** binibigay niya ang kanyang sarili sa Diyos. ==\n\t- Paradox: belonging to God is freeing\n- Ang sumusunod ay hiniram ni Westphal kay Marcel upang ilarawan ang malayang pagbibigay ng sariling kalayaan na ito:\n\n\u003e \"This does not mean . . . I am your slave; on the contrary, I freely put myself in your hands; the best use I can make of my freedom is to place it in your hands; it is as though I **freely substituted your freedom for my own**; or paradoxically, ==**it is by that very substitution that I realize my freedom**==\" (p.22-23)\n\n- Komentaryo:\n\t- freedom inherently has choice; self-determination\n\t- freedom provided by God: giving up our plans, desires? for the will of God\n\t- look at it as a gift (regalo)..gift of freedom\n- Ang \"substitution\" na nilalarawan ni Marcel dito ay **paghalili** *(replacement)* ng kalayaan ng iba sa iyong sariling kalayaan. Sa ganitong paraan, ==ang kalayaan ko ay waring 'napapalitan' ng kalayaan ng iba.==\n- Ang interesante rito ay kung paanong sa pagbibigay daw ng sariling kalayaan ko ay **doon ko rin lubusang naisasakatuparan ang sarili kong kalayaan.** *(By giving up my freedom, I also fully materialize my freedom)*\n\t- Kumbaga, hindi 'nawawala' o 'nasasayang' ang kalayaang ito; bagkus, lalo pa itong nagiging **tunay na** **akin** at **tunay na malaya** kapag ito'y isang kalayaan na nilalayon tuparin ang hinahangad ng iba.\n\t- Sa ganitong alternatibong pag-unawa sa kahulugan ng kalayaan ng tao--sa halip na isipin ito bilang pamamaraan upang matupad ko ang gusto't ninanais ko--maaaring magbago rin ang pag-unawa natin sa kahulugan ng ating pag-iral.\n- _Para saan o kanino nga ba nililikha at hinuhubog ng isang tao ang kanyang buhay gamit ang kanyang kalayaan? Para sa sarili lamang ba? O para sa iba?_\n\n#### Disponibilit√©\n- **Disponibilit√© *(disposability)*:** Ang maging ==para-sa-iba==, para sa Diyos man o sa kapuwa, ay ang pagiging handang tumugon sa kanilang tawag at tuparin ang kanilang niloloob. \n\t- Ang _dispsonibilit√©_ ay ang pagiging nariyan para sa pangangailangan ng iba.\n- Ang taong handang tumugon sa tawag ng iba ay isang taong ==handang iwan ang kanyang sarili.== Hindi man ito magawa sa lahat ng pagkakataon, ang taong handang tumugon sa tawag ng iba ay kayang isantabi ang kanyang pag-iisip at pagkilos para sa sarili lamang.\n- Kainino natin maaaring nasabi ang mga salitang \"Ako ay sa iyo\"? Kanino tayo maaaring maging handa isantabi ang sarili nating mga layunin upang isakatuparan ang layunin nila?\n\t- Baka nasabi mo na ang \"Ako ay sa iyo\"¬† sa isang iniibig mo. Kapag may ininiibig kang tao, hindi mo pinagkakait ang oras at lakas mo upang tugunan ang kanyang pangangailangan. Uunahin mo pa nga siya kaysa sa iyong sarili. Sa pagsabing _Mahal kita_ tila sinasabi mo rin na ikaw ay sa kanya. Tila may sinusuko kang bahagi ng iyong sarili, kundi man ang buong sarili mo mismo. Dahil ano namang uri ng pag-ibig iyon kung wala akong handang ibigay sa siyang iniibig ko? Anong klase ng pag-ibig iyon kung mauuna pa rin lagi ang aking sarili? Pag-ibig pa ba iyon kung walang magbabago sa akin?\n\n#### Kunin Mo\n- May isang dasal si San Ignacio na tinatawag na _Suscipe_. Nangangahulugan ang _suscipe_ ng \"pagkuha,\" o \"kunin.\" Tingnan natin ito ng sandali, bagaman malamang narinig mo na ito:\n\n**_Suscipe_¬† / \"Paghahandog ng Sarili\"**\n\u003e Take Lord, and receive all my liberty, \n\u003e my memory, my understanding, \n\u003e and my entire will, all that I have and possess. \n\u003e Thou hast given all to me. To Thee, O lord, I return it.\n\u003e All is Thine, dispose of it wholly according to Thy will. \n\u003e Give me Thy love and thy grace, for this is sufficient for me.\n\n\u003e Kunin Mo, O Diyos, at tanggapin Mo  \n\u003e Ang aking kalayaan, ang aking kalooban  \n\u003e Isip at gunita ko, lahat ng hawak ko,  \n\u003e Ng loob ko ay aking alay sa 'Yo\n\u003e \n\u003e Nagmula sa 'Yo ang lahat ng ito  \n\u003e Muli kong handog sa 'Yo  \n\u003e Patnubayan Mo't paghariang lahat  \n\u003e Ayon sa kalooban Mo  \n\u003e Mag utos Ka, Panginoon ko\n\u003e \n\u003e Dagling tatalima ako  \n\u003e Ipagkaloob Mo lang ang pag-ibig Mo  \n\u003e At lahat ay tatalikdan ko  \n\u003e Tatalikdan ko\n\n- Pansinin lamang na tila isang **kabalintuaan** *(paradox)* ang pinapahiwatig ng dasal ni San Ignacio. Sa halip na naisin niya na may matanggap siya **mula sa Diyos**, ang hiling ni Ignacio ay ang kunin at tanggapin ng Diyos ang lahat **mula sa kanya**. Nais ni Ignacio na gamitin siya ng Diyos ayon sa Kanyang mga ninanais; na maging instrumento siya upang tuparin ang niloloob ng Diyos.\n- Dagdag pa, makatuwiran lamang para kay Ignacio na ialay ang kanyang buong sarili sa Diyos dahil ==ang lahat naman na taglay niya--ang kanyang kalayaan, kalooban, isip at gunita, atbp.)--ay galing naman sa Diyos.==\n\t- Kung gayon, ang 'paghahandog' ni Ignacio ng kanyang sarili sa Diyos ay ==isang pababalik lamang ng kanyang natanggap--isang 'muling' pagbibigay.==\n- \"All is Thine, **dispose** of it wholly according to Thy will.\" \n\t- Makikita mo sa linyang ito ang mga bakas ng pagiging-sa-Diyos at _disponibilit√©_. \n\t- Kung mayroon mang dalisay na pananampalataya, marahil hindi ito nalalayo sa ipinapahiwatig ng dasal ni Ignacio.\n\n\n### \"Gelassenheit\"\n- Ang _Gelassenheit_ ay salitang Aleman na madalas isalin sa Ingles na ==\"to let be\" o \"letting-be.\"== Maaaring isalin ito sa wika natin bilang ==**pagpapaubaya** o **pagpaparaya**.==\n- Pansinin na sa katunayan, **napagpasyahan** **na** ng Diyos ang lahat ng mga mangyayari kay Maria.\n\t- Madaling isipin na ang pagsabi niya ng \"Mangyari sa akin\"/\"_Let it be_\" ay tila isang pagsuko sa isang hatol *(judgement)* na binaba na; isang pagsuko sa isang bagay kasi 'wala naman na akong magawa' (\"resignation,\" p.25).\n\t- Sa ganitong paraan maaaring isipin na tila ==balintiyak (_passive_)== ang _Gelassenheit_ at _fiat_ ni Maria: nagmumukha itong isang pagpapabaya na tila kung saan ==wala na akong gagawin dahil hindi naman ako kasama sa nangyari.==\n\t- Pero pansinin na ang **hayaang mangyari** ang isang bagay na siyang kaluhugan ng _Gelassenheit_ ay minsan ==mas mahirap pang gawin== kaysa sa anumang aktibong gawain_._\n- Halimbawa: Kapag hinahayaan ko ang aking anak na matutong magbisikleta sa sarili niya, hindi ko ito ginagawa dahil sa wala akong pakialam sa kanya. Kung ako lamang, ayaw kong bitawan ang bisekleta o tanggalin ang _training wheels_ dahil natatakot akong mahulog at masaktan siya. \n\t- Pero ano ang mangyayari kung hindi ko bibitawan ang bisekleta? Ano ang mangyayari kung hindi ko siya hahayaang matuto na ibalense ang sarili niya? Hindi siya matututo. Hindi siya makakabisikleta. Sa ganitong pagkakataon, ==ang **hayaan** ang anak ko matutunan ibalanse ang sarili niya ang paraan ng pagmamahal ko sa kanya.== Sa pagbitaw ko sa kanya, doon ko siya lalong minamahal.\n- Sa pagsabi ni Maria na \"mangyari sa akin ang ayon sa iyong salita,\" tila ito ang pinapahayag niya: '_Iyang sinasabi mo, bagaman kamangha-mangha at bagaman hindi ko lubos na naunawaan kung paano mangyayari, **hindi ko iyan babaguhin. Hahayaan kong mangyari iyan**.'_\n- Iyan ang halaga ng salitang \"**ayon**\" sa \"mangyari sa akin ang **ayon** sa iyong salita\" (o \"**according** to your word\").\n\t- Mahilig kasi tayong makialam sa mga pangyayari lalo na sa kung anong paraan ito mangyayari. Iyan ang hindi maiwasan ng isang tao na nasa sentro pa ng lahat.\n\t\t- Nais niya hawakan (_pris_) ang lahat; hindi siya nagtitiwala sa iba. Kaya tinatakda niya kung _ano_, _kailan_, at _paano_ magaganap ang isang pangyayari. \n\t\t- Kaya naman para sa taong ganito, wala talagang sorpresa (_sur-prise_) para sa kanya. Dahil ==wala siyang hinahayaang dumating mula sa labas ng abot-tanaw ng kanyang nalalaman at nahahawakan.==\n\t- Sa halip nito, ang tao na isinantabi ang kanyang sarili ay ==hinahayaang matupad ang isang pangyayari== **sa sarili** **nitong panahon**, mula sa **sarili nitong mga dahilan**, at sa pamamagitan ng **sarili nitong mga paraan**.\n\t\t- **Pinapahintulutan** *(give permission)* niyang pumasok sa kanyang buhay ang siyang nagmumula sa labas ng abot-tanaw ng kanyang iniisip, nahahawakan, inaasahan. \n\t\t- Para sa kanya,¬† may sorpresa--kundi man Diyos o anghel, maaaring isang kapuwa-tao na inaanyayahan siyang tumugon sa isang di-inasahang tawag.\n- **\"I must somehow make room for the other in myself\"** (p.22). Ang gumawa ng ganitong ==espasyo sa mismong sarili== upang tanggapin ang siyang dumarating na lamang bilang ==isang sorpresa==, iyan ang kahulugan ng _decentered self_.\n\n### \"Fiat voluntas tua\"\n\u003e **\"Prayer does not change God; it changes the one who offers it.\"**\n\u003e **S√∏ren Kierkegaard**\n\n- **Buod:**\n\t- Ang _fiat_ ni Maria ay ang ==pagpapahintulot niyang mangyari sa kanyang sariling buhay ang siyang naaayon sa salita ng Diyos.==\n\t- Ang hayaan mong baguhin ang iyong buhay ng isang \"Tao\" o \"Bagay\" (Ang Sumasaibayo), habang tunay na nakakatakot, marahil ito rin ==ang pinakamataas na pagsasakatuparan ng iyong kalayaan.==\n- Sa kanyang \"Mangyari sa akin ang ayon sa iyong salita,\" pansinin na may 'hinihiling' din si Maria mula sa Diyos. Tila may 'prayer request' din na mababakas sa kanyang _fiat._\n\t- Ngunit naunawaan mo na marahil na ibang-iba (dahil para-sa-iba) ang hiling ni Maria kaysa sa marahil pangkaraniwang ipinagdarasal ng tao. \n\t- Ang tanging hiling ni Maria ay ==_mangyari nga_ _sa kanya_ ang niloloob ng Diyos. ==\n\t- **_At sa aktong ito ng pagsuko ng sarili sa niloloob ng Diyos maaaring matagpuan natin ang ==dalisay na pananampalataya_**.==\n- **_Fiat voluntas tua_.** *(May thy will be done)*\n\t- Iyan din ang ibig sabihin ng \"Amen\" na binibigkas ng isang tao na nagdadasal sa katapusan ng \"Ama Namin\" (p.25) o ng ibang dasal. \n\t- Kapag tinutuldukan niya ang kanyang dasal ng salitang \"Amen\" pagkatapos sabihin ang lahat ng tila hinihiling niya sa Diyos para sa kanyang sarili, tila ang sinasabi pa rin niya ay _Sa lahat ng ito_==, _m__angyari pa rin nawa ang Kanyang niloloob--hindi ang kalooban ko._== Amen. _So be it_. Siya nawa.\n- Ayon kay Westphal, pagkatapos lamang ng pagkakaroon ng ganitong uri ng 'tindig' o _posture_ tungo sa nangungunang kalooban ng Diyos maaaring magdasal ang isang tao _para sa kanyang sarili_ at kanyang mga _minamahal_:\n\n\u003e We hear the decentering force of the prayer in its actual wording: **_your_** **name**, **_your_** **kingdom**, **_your_** **will** (Matt. 6:9‚Äì10). Here is a triple threat against all aspiration to autonomy, a triple abandonment of my preoccupation with myself. After, but **only after I have made this move**, **I am in a position to pray rightly for material and spiritual blessings, daily bread, and forgiveness, for myself and for ‚Äò‚Äòus.‚Äô‚Äô** And no sooner have I done so than the doxology, which is sometimes included in the prayer and sometimes serves as its liturgical trailer, reminds me of what I can so quickly forget: ‚Äò‚Äòfor the kingdom, the power, and the glory are yours, now and forever.‚Äô‚Äô **The Amen** (so be it) that concludes this prayer, echoes the **‚Äò‚Äòlet it be‚Äô‚Äô** of Mary‚Äôs prayer, just as the ‚Äò‚Äò_your_ name,‚Äô‚Äô ‚Äò‚Äò_your_ kingdom,‚Äô‚Äô and ‚Äò‚Äò_your_ will‚Äô‚Äô echo her ‚Äò‚Äò_your_ word.‚Äô‚Äô ==To feel the full force of the self-transformation called for by this self-transcendence is to understand how learning to pray is the **task of a lifetime**==\" (p.25).\n\n- _Paano ba magdasal? Ano ba ang ganap na dasal?_ Palagay ko hindi nakararating ang isang taong nagdarasal sa isang ganap o perpektong dasal hanggang siya'y nagpapatuloy mabuhay. \n\t- Kung ang dasal ay siya ngang pagsasantabi ng sarili upang gumawa ng espasyo para sa iba, kung gayon ang buhay ng tao ang kanyang mismong dasal. \n\t- Sa pang-araw-araw na buhay ==nagaganap itong pagsubok baguhin ang ating sarili upang tumugon sa tawag ng Diyos. ==\n\t- Marahil pa nga, ==ang pagtugon sa tawag ng kapuwa ay ang pagtugon din sa tawag ng Diyos.==\n- Kung ang pagdarasal nga ay ang akto ng tahimik na **pakikinig** at **pagiging handa** **na tumugon** sa **tawag ng isang Iba**, ==ang buhay nga ay maaari rin maging isang walang katapusang pagsubok matutong magdasal.==\n\n### Absolutong Pananagutan sa Diyos\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhQxZPdv-Y\n\n**Mga paksa na tinalakay sa lektura:**\n-   Mga yugto ng kuwento ng Pagsubok ng Diyos kay Abraham (Genesis 22: 1-14)\n-   Absolutong pananagutan *(responsibility)*\n    -   Pananagutan sa Iba\n    -   Pananagutan sa Diyos\n-   Absolutong pananampalataya *(faith)*\n    -   _double movement_ o \"dalawang kilos ng pananampalataya\" ayon kay Kierkegaard\n        1.  _infinite resignation_ o \"walang hanggang pagsuko\"\n        2.  _leap of_ _faith_ o \"lundag ng pananamplataya\"\n\n\n- **Ang dalisay na pananampalataya ay humahantong sa absolutong pananagutan sa Diyos**.\n- Sources:\n\t- [pagsubok ng Diyos kay Abraham (Genesis 22: 1-14)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+22\u0026version=MBBTAG)\n\t- ang mga kaisipan ng pilosopo na si S√∏ren Kierkegaard sa kanyang [_Fear and Trembling_](https://books.google.com.ph/books/about/Fear_and_Trembling.html?id=xODQDwAAQBAJ\u0026printsec=frontcover\u0026source=kp_read_button\u0026hl=en\u0026redir_esc=y#v=onepage\u0026q\u0026f=false).\n- Pambungad\n\t- \"To become involved with God in any other way than being wounded is impossible\": Soren Kierkegaard\n- Ang kuwento nina Abraham at Isaac\n\t- Walang dasal; purong aktong pakikining, at purong aktong paglalakbay (he just listened and did it)\n\t- Tanong ni Isaac: \"Mayroon na tayong apoy at panggatong, ngunit nasaan ang tupang ihahandog?\" Sumagot si Abraham, \"Anak, ang Diyos ang magbibigay niyon.\"\n\t\t- Nilihim niya ang plano niya *(secret)*\n\t- ginagawang singular? mag-isa? ng pananagutan (responsibility) niya\n\t- iwanan niya ang lahat\n- Absolutong Pananagutan\n\t- \"only one thing is necessary\"; \"iisa lang ang kinakailangan\": sinabi ni Kristo kay Maria\n- Absolutong Pananampalataya\n\t- Maybe Abraham wasn't lying when he said God would give it\n\t- *Double movement* ang ginawa ni Abraham\n\t\t- ==\"infinite resignation\":== walang hanggang pagsuko *(surrender to God forever)*\n\t\t\t- iniwan ng lahat, sinasabi na \"sa diyos nalang ako\"; lahat ng mahalaga sa akin ay wala na\n\t\t- ==\"leap of faith\": ==lundag ng pananampalataya\n\t\t\t- nandoon pa rin ng pananampalataya na hindi mawala si Isaac\n\t\t\t- \"By virtue of the absurd...\" hindi lang alam kung paano, may ipinagkaloob ng Diyos\n\t\t\t- Hal. trust fall\n\t\t\t\t- Para maging successful ng trust fall mo, kailangan mo malundag...\n\t\t\t\t- Kailangan ka maging handa na masaktan ka\n\t\t\t\t- Pero maniwala ka na hindi ka nasasaktan (kasi alam mo nasasaluin ka)\n- \"Sa bundok ni Yahweh may nakalaan\"\n\t- Nakalaan: reserve, destined\n\t- sa pagbibgay ko sa kanya, hindi siya mawala sa akin....\n\t- Alam mo lang ng pagsubok ay pagiging pagsubok kung tapos na siya\n\n### Mapagmuni-muning Papel\n**Tanong: Dalisay ba ang pananampalataya ni Yossel Rakover sa Diyos?**\n#### Notes\n##### Story\n\u003e I never saw my two children again, and in a dream I was told not to worry about them, because theyw ere in the hands of *Rebyoyne-shel-Oylem* (\"Almighty God\")\n\n\u003e Like Job...I return to the earth naked\n\n\u003e I served God enthusiastically, and my one request of Him was that He should allow me to serve Him *bikol livovekho, bikhol nafshekho ubikhol miodekho* (\"With all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might\"; Deuteronomy 6:5, Hebrew)\n\n\u003e ...I can say with absolutely certainity that my faith in Him has not changed a hair's breadth\n\n\u003e Formerly, well-off: relationship with God was one who kept on granting favors\n\u003e Now: one who owes me something, owes me much; he believes he has the right to demand it of Him\n\n\u003e Won't ask why he deserves this (related to Mary?); instead, believes that it's a time of *histress-ponim* (\"Veiling of God's countenance\") (support?)\n\u003e God has veiled His countenance from the world, and has thus delivered people over to their savage impulses.

Need to be okay with uncertainty in my life...all in God's plan\n\n##### Draft\nSoren Kierkegaard once said that \"to become involved with God in any other way than being wounded is impossible\". We seek a relationship with God so that we can become better people. However, change requires sacrifice, which is inherently painful. Therefore, after reading the appeal of Yassel Rakover's, a Holocaust victim, I believe that his faith in God is true. This can be seen in his relationship with God and how he applies it to his life. \n\nRakover's faith is true because it's unconditional. Conditional faith is fragile because it's based on expectations for God ‚Äî setting people up for disappointment. For instance, many people see God as one that grants favors. When they go through a negative or positive experience that disrupts this image (e.g. the silence of God; the existence of evil), their faith in God is diminished. Despite being a victim of the Holocaust, Rakover's faith in God remains. \n\nWhat drives his faith? He's aware that he lacks an understanding of God. According to San Agustin, a God that can be understood is not God; anything that can be understood about him does not belong to him. Since he is \"semper major\" (ever greater), he'll always slip past our limited understanding. So when we try to define him, we end up putting him in a prison of our expectations ‚Äî preventing God from being different from these.\n\nThis is why Rakover doesn't want to assume that God and his judgment are just: it disrespects God. Assuming that the Jews deserve bad would desecrate God because it reduces him to a simplistic concept. Believing in a God we can never understand is a challenge we struggle with our entire lives. Rakover does this until the time of his death. That's unconditional faith: one that is unwavering. \n\nThe authenticity of Rakover's faith can also be seen in how he practices it in life: finding meaning in his suffering through God. He writes: \"I am proud that I am a Jew not in spite of the world's treatment of us, but precisely because of this treatment\". He believed that the pain he went through brought honor to God's laws. His perspective can be seen as a religious experience, according to St. Tomas. He chose (eligare) to tie (ligare) himself to God ‚Äî an entity bigger than him ‚Äî making him read (legere) his life through a different lens. \n\nHe ties himself to God through prayer, which Merold Westphal calls the \"deepest decentering of the self\". This happens through the process of *kenosis*, where he sets aside his own desires (e.g. miracles, mercy, vengeance). He gives himself up so that he can belong to God. He voluntarily became God's servant, ready to fully respond and fulfill his needs with all of his heart, soul, and might (*bikhol livovekho, bikhol nafshekho ubikhol miodekho*). This is *disponibilit√©*, and it can also be seen in the last line of his appeal: \"Biyodekho Adoshem afkid rukhi!\", which means \"Into Your Hands, O lord, I commit my spirit!\" Can you call your faith true if you always put yourself first, not ready to give yourself to the one you believe in?\n\nHowever, Rakover describes his relationship with God as \"...no longer the relationship of a slave to his master but rather that of a pupil to his rebbe\". Belonging to God shouldn't be seen as owning something that you can dispose of when you don't need it. Instead, it is freely giving yourself to God. And by giving your own freedom, you also fully materialize it. Using his own freedom, Rakover creates and shapes his life not for himself, but for his God. As a rebbe, God teaches Rakover the singular way to live his life: the Torah. This opens his perspective, showing him how to find meaning in everything that he does ‚Äî even dying. \n\nThe result of true faith is an absolute responsibility to God. Rakover fulfills this through *gelassenheit*: letting be of his life. After a long duration of trying to survive and fight (active doing), he accepts his death. In this act, we can see what Kierkegaard calls the double movements of faith. First, infinite resignation. Rakover leaves behind everything important to him, including his life, except his faith in God ‚Äî who he still believes in until his death. Second, the leap of faith. Even if he is giving up his life, he still believes that he will be saved by God. This can be seen in his belief in an afterlife. Just like Abraham believed that there is something destined for us in God's mountain, Rakover believes that he will have a space in heaven, together with his family and millions of dead Jews. Perhaps this is why Jews die peacefully. Because of their faith, death is seen as not worrying but freeing. Despite not knowing what'll happen to them, they are certain that they'll be taken care of by God. \n\nOne thing that I can learn from them is the ability to let go of control in my life. My desire to secure my future has led me to make extensive career plans and work endless hours. The results of this were constant anxiety and perpetual burnout. Personally, I'm still trying to fight my workaholism; what has really helped me was reconnecting with my faith. It has taught me that there are much more important things in life than success and that God has a plan for all of us. It is him, not me, who knows what's best for my life. This belief allows me to be open to whatever happens to me, even if it's disappointing. Just like with Rakover, I believe that suffering is how God shows his love, for it's what helps me become a better person.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.723605439Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2022-03-14":{"title":"2022-03-14","content":"## ENE\n### An Overview of Discourse\n**Questions:**\n- What enables us to think about and in the process, tell these stories?\n- Why and how can we tell stories in a way that is compelling and engaging at the same time?\n\n**Notes:**\n- Ratsinsky (2011) argued that the idea of discourse has become increasingly popular; has been used many times without being explicitly defined\n- Discourse in narrative studies is the way a story is told or presented to its audience\n- Includes:\n\t- how much time is dedicated to a particular scene\n\t- The amount of dialogue that is allotted to a particular character\n\t- The choice of actors to play characters\n- Basically: The expression/telling of a story\n- Questions:\n\t- Is it possible to have an exciting plot, but a lousy discourse? \n\t- Or possble to have a lousy plot or engaging narrative discourse?\n\n**TL;DR:**\n- It's the ==way a story is told or presented== to the audience. \n-  If narrative structure is the WHAT, narrative discourse is the ==HOW.==\n\n### Order, Duration, \u0026 Frequency\n**Notes:**\n- Order\n\t- the organization of the presents, and how it's presented to us\n\t- significant bc of how the events may be pieced together by the audience\n\t- important to the overall story and/or theme/topic!\n- Duration\n\t- often tied with frequency\n\t\t- both elements place emphasis on events\n\t\t- they tell us about a particular point/episode in a character's life?\n\t- E.G.

Not beginner-friendly at all! Requires a lot of technical literacy....\n\n\n**Writing:**\n\nA topic I'd love to change the discourse of in STEM is Web3. This refers to the newest iteration of the World Wide Web; based on blockchain technology, it includes innovations like cryptocurrencies and NFTs. Like many of my friends, I used to be a skeptic; based on what I saw I assumed that these technologies were wasteful and that only the rich and privileged could benefit from them. However, after exploring this space on my own (by [joining fellowships](https://kernel.community) and contributing to communities), I realized Web3's potential in building a better future ‚Äî one that is solarpunk.\n\nSolarpunk originally started as a niche environmental movement centered around renewable energy and sustainable technology; it's now evolved to be all about building an optimistic future together. Some questions to think of: How can we integrate, rather than separate, technology and our environment? How can we thrive alongside each other and the world around us, instead of being in opposition to it? How can we advocate for convivial conservation, self-sustainability, and social inclusiveness, and make sure that these are accessible to everyone? In a nutshell: if typical sci-fi genres like cyberpunk are focused on what we should move away from (e.g. dystopian mega-corps, corrupt governments, fading rebel alliances), then solarpunk is focused on what we should move towards in the future.\n\nIn a solarpunk future, I believe that public goods are abundant. These can come in so many forms;  they exist not only in the physical sphere (e.g. parks, libraries, public transportation) but also in the [digital sphere](https://issuu.com/biancamikaila/docs/aguilar_finalproject) (e.g. knowledge, software, privacy). Despite how vital public goods are to our lives (can you imagine a world without museums or Wikipedia?), they're often difficult to develop due to a lack of support from the public. This problem is known as the [tragedy of the commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons): people usually act selfishly and cause depletion of a public resource, instead of working together to sustain it. A promising solution to this are regenerative economic tools being built in the Web3 space; these can serve as a coordination mechanism that ensures that everyone contributes. One example of this is [Gitcoin Grants](https://gitcoin.co/grants/), which can be described as Web3 version of Kickstarter. Public goods projects are supported through [Quadratic Funding](https://www.radicalxchange.org/concepts/quadratic-funding/): a mathematically optimal model that prioritizes projects based on how many people contributed; this encourages people to make contributions (no matter how small they are) since it's ensured that funds will be democratically allocated in a way that benefits the public.\n\nUnfortunately, not many people of because of the pessimistic narratives that saturate the space (e.g. hyperfinancialization, environmental destruction). Even if these are based on truth, we need to resist doomerism; if we aren't intentional in choosing the narratives we want to see in the world, we could end up trapped in them. While it's important to be critical of new tech, we should also utilize the agency we have to take back control. This is what a solarpunk narrative does; it gives us hope because it reminds us that we all play a role in building the future we want to see. This optimistic mindset is what motivates me to stay involved in the space. As a designer and educator, I want to change Web3's dominant narrative by helping bring these regenerative tools to life ‚Äî whether it's through building them or advocating for them. The more people get to benefit from these tools, the more positive the narrative will become. \n\n**Sources:**\n\n### Discourse in a nutshell\n- Discourse is the HOW of our narratives\n- Defined and described in various ways...\n\t- **Narrative studies**\n\t\t- the way events are told\n\t\t- the presentation/expression of the events\n\t\t- *the way the events are told is meant to cause certain effects on us as readers \u0026 viewers*\n\t- **Post-structuralism**\n\t\t- very related to ideology\n\t\t- uncovering ways we end up talking about things over a period of time\n\t\t- *So much of what was taught to us to accept are in fact, not common sense knowledge*\n\t- **Discourse \u0026 language**\n\t\t- a way to talk about things that have persisted for a long time\n\t\t- studying how content can be presented to people \u0026 community\n\t\t- *analysis of discourse can help influence people and align them to our cause*\n- Why we study discourse\n\t- What's the agenda here?\n\t- Is there an agenda that I'm not aware of?\n\t- What am I missing here?\n\t- What is the narrative telling me?\n\t- What is it NOT telling me?\n- Changing discourse = changing society\n\n### Application Task 1\n\u003e In an essay using 1,500 words or less, discuss your answer to the question: _HOW DID SAVE RALPH, THROUGH ITS DISCOURSE, HELP YOU UNDERSTAND A KEY MESSAGE THAT YOU FOUND IN THE NARRATIVE?_ Below are some guide questions to help you get started: \n\n-   What key message/agenda did you see from the short film? \n-   What \"universal knowledge\" did the film try to go against? \n-   How did the elements of order, duration, and frequency, and other elements of the narrative help deliver that message/agenda?\n\n#### Draft\n**Notes:**\n- Key message agenda: stop animal testing for human cosmetics\n- Universal knowledge: animal testing for cosmetics is okay\n- How did elements of the narrative help deliver that message/agenda?\n\t- Order\n\t\t- We first spent time getting to know Ralph more...this humanized him, which helped us empathize with him more (e.g. morning routine, human setting, talking about family and dreams)\n\t\t- that way, when we got to the climax and conclusion (him being tested, being near death), it hit harder\n\t\t- presented as a documentary from his POV\n\t- Duration\n\t\t- majority of film dwelt on getting to know him (2 minutes)\n\t\t- abruptly went to testing part...was shorter bc we already have an idea of what testing is like\n\t\t- testing was cut off -\u003e went straight to aftermath\n\t\t\t- we don't need to see all of the testing to see how much it hurt :(\n\t- Frequency\n\t\t- testing is brought up a lot of times (e.g. his identity, everyone around him is a tester)\n\t\t- his pain is shown frequently as well :( (e.g. itching)\n\n**Ideas:**\n- maybe compare with PETA ads? they're gimmicky, which allows them to catch attention; however, they can turn a lot of people off\n\n**Outline:**\n1.

Conclusion; how it affected me\n\n#### Writing\n\nLet's be honest: humans are a pretty selfish race. This can be seen in the state of the animals around us; if they're not endangered or extinct, they're probably being used for producing our needs. How can we convince others to treat animals right? By humanizing them. The film \"Save Ralph\" accomplished this; through its discourse, it advocated for banning animal testing for human cosmetics. It did this by taking the form of a documentary centered around Ralph, a rabbit who works as a test subject. By showing us his point of view, the film made us empathize with animals, the subject of the issue. I'll be explaining how the film delivered its anti-testing agenda by analyzing the elements of its narrative.\n\nFirst, order: the way the narrator chose to organize and present events of the story to the audience.

He tells us that all of his family were subjects as well, saying: ‚ÄúThey all died doing their job, just like I will!\". Through illustrating his pain and loss, the film demonstrates how this human practice has made his life miserable, even before showing the testing itself. So by the time he is brought to the laboratory, we've become fully acquainted with him; this makes the succeeding scenes difficult to watch. \n\nNext, duration: the amount of time that was spent on scenes. Majority of the film was spent on getting to know Ralph; this ensured enough time for the audience to develop an attachment to him. The actual testing took the least amount of time; it even cut off while Ralph's eye was getting destroyed. The short and snappy style of this scene helped maximize its impact. If it was prolonged, I believe that the film would be less effective. It would've become similar to poverty porn, which exploits its subjects for the sake of triggering emotion. For example: whenever a natural disaster happens, I hate it whenever the news promotes \"Filipino resilience\" because it objectifies the victims. As someone who is highly sensitive, being exposed to an onslaught of these visuals (e.g. kids playing in the flood) is exhausting; it makes me want to disconnect from the world. If you want people to act, don't convince them in a way that turns them off.\n\nThankfully, \"Save Ralph\" doesn't do this. More time is spent on the aftermath of the testing, which helped further emphasize Ralph's humanity. Here, Ralph directly talks to the camera, thanking people who support animal testing for giving him a job (which is also a human construct). However, his grateful speech was in stark contrast with his aching appearance.  Even if we didn't see all of his testing, we can already tell that it's hurt him greatly. He didn't die, but it's implied that his death is near too. The film explicitly leaves out these scenes, making the audience fill in the gaps themselves. When we realize the gravity of his situation on our own, it hits much harder. \n\nFinally, frequency: the number of times a specific event recurred throughout the narrative. Alongside duration, this element is used by the the film in its \"Show, Don't Tell\" approach; it conveys its agenda through the context clues it provides for the audience. One instance of this is Ralph's symptoms, which he obviously struggles with for the entire film, from scratching his itchy back to needing help with his blindness. Another instance is the death of Ralph's loved ones, which is shown explicitly and implcitly. Before he admits that his family died from testing, we can see signs of life in his home (e.g. mug with multiple toothbrushes, family photos on the walls). His colleagues shout that they don't want to die; during the last scene, multiple crossed out names are written on the lockers. By constantly referencing affliciton and death, the film drives home the point that testing kills animals.\n\nBy humanizing animals in its discourse, \"Save Ralph\" was able to effectively campaign for banning cosmetic animal testing. It was able to motivate millions to sign their petition, propel Mexico to ban testing, and help advance legislation in many countries that make up the world‚Äôs most influential beauty markets (Humane Society International). I can't help but compare this campaign to PETA's advertising, which is infamous for making use of sexism and pornography (Pennington). Gimmicks may guarantee you attention, but will it help you accomplish your objective? What if your tactics end up alienating your target audience? This is why I believe in the value of liberal arts subjects like narrative studies. If changing discourse changes society, then it's important to know how to do it right. \n\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.723605439Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2022-03-16":{"title":"2022-03-16","content":"## ENE Application Task\n**Movie:** Birdshot\n- **What is the narrative all about?**\n\t- You may choose to discuss the plot using the structures that we discussed in Module 1\n\t- OR any structure that you deem appropriate in your discussion of the film's events\n- **How did the narrative tell the story?**\n\t- What \"universal knowledge\" about a key science issue did the film try to unpack and shift the conversation off?\n\t- How did it try to do this? \n\t- What \"new ways\" of looking at the issue did the film try to bring forward?\n\n**Notes:**\n- begins with teaching daughter how to shoot, because he wants her to learn how to take care of himself\n- goes to Domingo, the policeman POV? humanizing him? showing him w his family\n- issue: environmentalism? killing animals, illegal logging....\n- police are corrupt? boss is paying them. the older policeman resorts to violence during questioning. omg it got cut off right when they were gonna cut off his arm\n- how is the missing bus case related? \"everything starts from nothing\"\n- shit she went beyond the border....shit she shoots the eagle....the murder was cut off too...\n- oh shit shes wounded and running away\n- another issue: Hacienda; disupute for land....workers vs landlords\n- bus case may be political.....\n- \"it's not our fault\"\n- people trying to take the bus...\n- he had a dream?\n- they question Diego\n- Domingo tortues Diego himself....changes from naive to morally questionable\n- WTF THEY SHOT THE DOG....they also cut this\n- prison scene...shit they kill the guard...they break out\n- very snappy shots\n- very show dont tell approach\n- oh fuck theyre chasing diego\n- they attempt to run away, maya says she can fight for herself na\n- the shooting is cut away too\n- diego died too :((\n- great parallel: hunting birds at the beginning vs hunting man at the end\n- oh fuck domingo is escaping\n- OH FUCK THE DEAD PASSENGERS WERE IN THE HABITATION....\n\u003e \n\u003e For his second full-length feature film, young filmmaker Mikhail Red interweaves two plotlines that deal about loss of innocence of two characters as they cope with the harsh realities of survival.

This idea is based on my Christian beliefs. One, God created the entire universe, which can be seen in the story of Genesis. Two, we were created in God's image and likeness. Our creativity is enabled by our capacity for critical thinking; if we were based on God, this indicates that our creativity comes from Him. However, I realized that this idea was \"idolatry\". This is because it acted as an \"invisible mirror\": speaking more of myself than of \"God\". I consider myself as an artist that works across many mediums: design, dance, writing, etc; I was projecting onto God the idea of creativity because it was something I wanted for myself. God is so much more than my experiences or desires.\n\nSo what is God's true nature? According to Marion, we can derive this through via negativa: a way of getting to know God by not knowing him. This can be applied to the criteria of being/existence and essence. One, being/existence: does God exist? We consider something to exist if it can be experienced by us in the planes of space and time. However, God is impossible to experience. If he can be experienced in these planes, this makes him limited. How does this apply to my \"idol\"? Let's consider works that are created by God, like nature and the Bible. These can be seen, touched, and studied by us. Thus, they are lacking depictions of God.\n\nTwo, essence: what is God? We can only understand something if we have a concept of it. However, God cannot be given any concept. As said by San Agustin, concepts about God that can be understood by us do not belong to God at all. How does this apply to my \"idol\"? We already have a concept of what a creative person looks like; if you ask a kid to draw this, they'll probably give you the image of a painter with a paintbrush, a musician with an instrument, a photographer with a camera, etc. This shows that we link a person's creativity to existing items: not just the tools they use, but also the outputs they produce. When we assume that God is creative, we box him in our definition of creativity. \n\nOverall, when it comes to God, we are left with the idea of impossibility. My idol showed me the limits of my experience and understanding, and God surpasses these. But I guess this makes my faith stronger. God may not be the creator I envisioned him to be, but his lack of limitations will continue to inspire me. \n\n\n###### Filipino\n\nPara sa akin, ang Diyos ay isang manlilikha, at siya ang pangunahing ugat ng pagkamalikhain. Nakabatay ito sa paniniwalang Kristiyano. Una, ginawa ang Diyos ng buong sanlibutan; maaaring nakikita ito sa kwento ng Genesis. Ikalawa, nilikha ang tao ayon sa larawan at wangis ng Diyos. Kaya natin maging malikhain dahil kaya natin ng kritikal na pag-iisip; kung bumatay tayo sa Diyos, galing ang aming pagkamalikhain sa kanya. Gayunman, nabatid ako na \"idolo\" lamang pala ang pagpapalagay ko sa Diyos kasi parang itong salamin ‚Äî itinuturo ito ang aking sarili imbes ng Diyos. Kinikilala ako bilang isang artista na lumilikha sa mga iba't ibang daluyan: disenyo, sayaw, sulat, at iba pa; ipinalagay ako ng ideya ng pagkamalikhain sa Diyos dahil marami akong alam tungkol dito, at ito ang gusto ko para sa sarili ko. Pero lumalampas ang Diyos sa aking mga karanasan at nais. \n\nAno ba talaga ang totoong ugali ng Diyos? Ayon kay Marion, pwede kami nawawari ito sa pamamagitan ng *via negativa*: isang pamaraan ng pagkilala sa Diyos sa pamamagitan ng hindi pagkilala sa kanya. Maaaring ito inilagay sa pamantayan ng pag-iral at esensya. Una, pag-iral: umiiral ba ang Diyos? Sa palagay namin, nag-iiral ang isang bagay kung pwede kami maranasan ito sa espasyo at panahon. Kaso ang Diyos ay imposibleng maransan. Kung pwede siya maranasan sa mga anyong nito, magiging limitado siya. Paano ito nakikita sa \"idolo\" ko? Isipin natin ang mga gawa ng \"Diyos\", tulad ng kalikasan at ang Bibliya. Maaari tayo nakikita, humahawak, at nagsusuri ang mga gawa na ito, kaya kulang sila bilang paglalarawan ng Diyos.\n\nIkalawa, esensya: ano ang Diyos? Kaya lang natin maiintindihan ng isang bagay kung meron tayong konsepto nito. Pero imposibleng mabigyan ng konsepto ang Diyos. Gaya ng sinabi ni San Agustin, hindi Diyos ang may-ari ng mga konsepto na pwede natin maiintindihan. Paano ito nakikita sa \"idolo\" ko? Mayroon na tayong konsepto ng manlilikha; kung hiniling ang isang bata na gumuhit nito, malamang gughit sila ng pintor na may pintura, musikero na may instrumento, o potograpo na may kamera. Nagpapakita ito na iniuugnay tayo ang pagkamalikhain ng isang tao sa mga konkretong gamit: ang mga kasangkapan at gawa niya. Kapag akala natin malikhain ang Diyos, ikinahon natin siya sa aming kahulugan ng pagmalikhain.\n\nSa huli, pagdating sa Diyos, matitira ang ideya ng imposibilidad. Tinuruan ng \"idolo\" ko sa akin ang mga limitasyon ng aking karanasan at pag-iintindihan kasi walang hangganan ang Diyos. Pero dahil dito, naging mas matibay ang aking pananampalataya. Maaaring hindi ang Diyos isang manlilikha, ngunit siya parin ang inspriasyon ko.\n\n\n\nPara sa akin, ang Diyos ang tunay na lumikha, at siya ang pangunahing pinagmumulan ng pagkamalikhain. Ang ideyang ito ay batay sa aking paniniwalang Kristiyano. Una, nilikha ng Diyos ang buong sansinukob; maaaring nakikita ito sa kuwento ng Genesis. Ikalawa, tayo ay nilikha ayon sa larawan at wangis ng Diyos. Kaya natin maging malikhain dahil kaya natin ng kritikal na pag-iisip; kung tayo ay batay sa Diyos, ito ay nagpapahiwatig na ang ating pagkamalikhain ay mula sa Kanya. Gayunpaman, napagtanto ko na ang ideyang ito ay \"idolatrya\" kasi parang itong salamin ‚Äî mas nagsasalita ito tungkol sa aking sarili kaysa sa \"Diyos\". Kinikilala ako bilang isang artista na lumilikha sa mga iba't ibang daluyan: disenyo, sayaw, sulat, at iba pa; ipinakita ko sa Diyos ang ideya ng pagkamalikhain dahil ito ay isang uri na gusto ko para sa aking sarili. Pero lumalampas ang Diyos sa aking mga karanasan at mga hangarin.\n\nKaya ano ba talaga ang totoong ugali ng Diyos? Ayon kay Marion, maaari nating makuha ito sa pamamagitan ng *via negativa*: isang paraan ng pagkilala sa Diyos sa pamamagitan ng hindi pagkilala sa kanya. Ito ay maaaring ilapat sa pamantayan ng pag-iral at esensya. Isa, pag-iral: umiiral ba ang Diyos? Itinuturing nating umiral ang isang bagay kung pwede natin mararanasan ito sa espasyo at panahon. Gayunpaman, imposibleng maranasan ng Diyos. Kung nararanasan siya sa mga anyong ito, nagiging limitado siya. Paano ito nalalapat sa aking \"idolo\"? Isaalang-alang natin ang mga gawang nilikha ng Diyos, tulad ng kalikasan at ang Bibliya. Maari tayo makikita, mahahawakan, at mapag-aaralan ang mga gawa na ito. Kaya, kulang sila sa mga paglalarawan ng Diyos. \n\nDalawa, esensya: ano ang Diyos? Maiintindihan lang natin ang isang bagay kung mayroon tayong konsepto nito. Gayunpaman, imposibleng mabigyan ng konsepto ang Diyos. Gaya ng sinabi ni San Agustin, ang mga konsepto tungkol sa Diyos na mauunawaan natin ay hindi pag-aari ng Diyos. Paano ito nalalapat sa aking \"idolo\"? Mayroon na tayong konsepto kung ano ang hitsura ng isang taong malikhain; kung hihilingin mo sa isang bata na iguhit ito, malamang na ibibigay nila sa iyo ang larawan ng isang pintor na may paintbrush, isang musikero na may instrumento, isang potograpo na may kamera, atbp. Ipinapakita nito na iniuugnay namin ang pagkamalikhain ng isang tao sa mga kasalukuyang gamit: ang mga kasangkapan at gawa niya. Kapag ipinapalagay natin na ang Diyos ay malikhain, ikinakahon natin siya sa ating kahulugan ng pagkamalikhain. \n\nSa huli, pagdating sa Diyos, naiwan tayo sa ideya ng imposibilidad. Ipinakita sa akin ng aking \"idolo\" ang mga limitasyon ng aking karanasan at pag-unawa, at nalampasan ng Diyos ang mga ito. Ngunit sa palagay ko ito ang nagpapatibay sa aking pananampalataya. Maaaring hindi ang Diyos ang manlilikha na naisip ko sa kanya, ngunit ang kanyang kakulangan sa mga limitasyon ay patuloy na nagbibigay-inspirasyon sa akin.\n","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.723605439Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2022-04-07":{"title":"2022-03-28","content":"## PHILO\n#philosophy #religion \n### Seksiyon III.

Hindi ko maikukulong ang Diyos sa isang pakakakilala lamang at hindi ko rin dapat asahan na ipapatupad Niya ang aking bawat hiling sa paraang gusto ko.

We try to understand God by coming up with concepts and definitions which are based on our experiences. However, these are limited to what we consider possible. According to Marion, what is impossible for us as mortals/human beings is possible for God; he surpasses all of our understanding. Believers like me will be trying to learn about God for our whole lives. I believe we'll only be able to do this if we let go of our conceptions of Him.\n\nBilang naniniwala sa Diyos: kung walang imposible sa Kanya, maaaring sabihin na tayo ang nagtatakda ng limitasyon sa Kanya. Subukan nating maiintindihan ng Diyos sa pamamagitan ng paggawa ng mga konsepto at depinisyon na galing sa ating mga karansan. Samantalang limitado ito sa kung ano ang posibilidad para sa amin. Ayon kay Marion, ang imposible sa atin ay posible sa Diyos; lumalampas siya sa ating pag-unawa. Bilang naniniwala, susubukan nating matuto tungkol sa Diyos.

Sacrificing something less (yourself) for something greater\n\t\t\t\t- CAVEAT: the claim that a relationship violates the human person is made more often than warranted\n- **This is the human reality that \"becomes\" a sacrament by virtue of the baptism of the parties**\n\t- Questions:\n\t\t- What does baptism \"do\" to effect this \"ontological\" change?\n\t\t- How does baptism do this?\n\t- Answers:\n\t\t- Baptism puts the life of the person on a ==different plane of meaning==\n\t\t- Through baptism, a person takes on the ==new responsibility of participating in the prophetic mission of Christ and of the church==\n\t\t- The marriage of baptized persons has a special meaning\n\t\t\t- See *Infra*\n\n#### The Sacramentality of Marriage\n- **Marriage in general (as a human and natural reality) in SS**\n\t- According to Genesis...\n\t\t- Man and woman are different ways of reflecting God's image\n\t\t- Their union in marriage is part of God's plan and is thus good\n\t- According to Hosea...\n\t\t- Marriage is seen as an apt symbol of the covenant between Yahweh (ever faithful one) and Israel\n\t\t- Prophet Hosea was held as a \"model\" because of his fidelity to his wife Gomer\n\t\t- When a person is baptized, he also assumes a prophetic function in the manner of Hosea, ==to witness to and remind the world of God's fidelity to his covenant==\n\t\t- What does the Hosea-Gomer event say about marriage in general?\n\t\t\t- Capacity of marriage to be an ==adequate and appropriate language to be a symbol of God's fidelity==\n\t\t\t- Spouses like Hosea have to be faithful....otherwise Yahweh could not speak through them and their marriage\n\t\t\t- Emphasizes necessity of human responsibility and cooperation with Yahweh\n\t\t\t- Hosea and Gomer: predecessor of Christian spouses\n\t- According to Mark...\n\t\t- context of conversation: divorce in the Old Testament (DIY divorce)\n\t\t- Jesus says no to this DIY divorce\n\t\t\t- Moses only allowed this because of the hardness of your heart...but this was not so from the beginning\n\t\t- Jesus: Marriage should be stable, not easily breakable, certainly not easily as the DIY divorce\n\t- Summary and Conclusion\n\t\t- Being male and female and their union in marriage is part of ==God's plan==\n\t\t- Marriage has the capacity to be a ==language==\n\t\t\t- Has the depth and richness to carry a meaning beyond the natural reality\n\t\t\t- Yahweh used the Hosea-Gomer marriage to reassure Israel of his unconditional fidelity\n\t\t- Quality of marriage affirmed by Jesus in Mark is its ==stability==\n\t\t\t- This makes marriage a maturing context even as a natural reality\n\t\t\t- This same quality makes marriage an appropriate symbol and witness to God's fidelity to its people\n- **Marriage as a Christian Sacrament (according to Ephesians)**\n\t- Overview\n\t\t- Paul reflects on the richness and depth of the reality of marriage, and attributes it to a special meaning\n\t\t- He interprets the \"human reality\" of marriage and sees God's presence and work in the loving, committed and responsible relationship between man and woman\n\t- Quotes\n\t\t- Genesis 2, 24:\n\t\t\t- Nobility of marriage ‚Äî one leaves his family of origin to start his/her own family\n\t\t\t- Equality of man and woman ‚Äî both man and woman shall leave their respective families, and now cling to each other\n\t\t- Mark 10: Jesus derived the conjclusion that ==what God has joined together, man must not separate== ‚Äî the stability/indissoulubility of marriage\n\t\t- Paul's take on this text: marriage is a great mystery which refers to ==Christ and the Church==\n\t- Mystery in Paul summary\n\t\t- Eph 5, 32: the word is used to refer to the comparison of marriage to the union of Christ and the Church\n\t\t- There is a great hidden truth being revealed in the committed one-flesh relationship between man and wife, and this truth refers to the ==relationship between Christ and the Church==\n\t\t- The relationship between H-W should reveal this truth about Christ and the Church\n\t\t- H-W, like the apostles, and Hosea and Gomer, ==participate in this prophetic mission to reveal God's fidelity to his people==\n\t- Theological Reflection\n\t\t- Introductory Comments\n\t\t\t- General\n\t\t\t\t- The structure of the sacrament: like fully human acts, there is a ==material form (sensate)== and a ==meaning (supra sensate)==\n\t\t\t\t\t- E.G. bread and wine -\u003e spiritual noruishment\n\t\t\t\t- There is a proportion of meaning and resonance between the symbol and the meaning\n\t\t\t\t- \"Symbol\" is not merely an external reality that stands in the place of its meaning as a substitute reality\n\t\t\t\t\t- E.G. blue eage on the facade of the gym, St. Ignatius Loyola kneeling down to offer his sword\n\t\t\t\t- The symbol has an ==intrinsic connection== with its meaning\n\t\t\t\t\t- E.G. flowers and gifts are symbols of your love\n\t\t\t\t\t- They are not mere external signs or labels of your love; they also make your love more real + deeper\n\t\t\t\t\t- \"Efficient\" signs that cause something in the relationship\n\t\t\t\t- The \"symbols\" in the sacraments were not Catholic inventions; they were taken over and transformed\n\t\t\t\t\t- E.G. Water and washing are human realities that lead themselves to symbolic interpretation\n\t\t\t\t\t- Old Testament: oil was used to anoint kings due to its preservative qualities\n\t\t\t\t\t- Chrisitanity took over these symbols and gave them new meaning\n\t\t\t- When we affirm that baptism, confirmation, Eucharist, marriage etc. are sacraments, we are affirming the ff. of them:\n\t\t\t\t- They are ==official acts of the Church==\n\t\t\t\t- They are a means to ==accomplish the mission of Christ== (salvific/redemptive)\n\t\t\t\t- They are a ==language== through which God speaks to us that we may know him better, a deeper heart-knowledge of God (revelatory)\n\t\t\t- Marriage was the last sacrament to be recognized as an official act of the Church due to some theological difficulties (not yet fully resolved)\n\t\t\t\t- What is the human reality that becomes a sacrament? Theological consenseus: ==the entire life of the spouses becomes the sacrament, not just the ceremony in the Church==\n\t\t\t\t\t- In the beginning, there was no (Catholic) ritual for marraige. The husband and wife just moved in togetehr and they were accepted as married by the community\n\t\t\t\t- Objection: Marriage includes sexual relations and sex can only be justified when done for procreation; but sex in marriage is not only for procreation so it is actually an opportunity for sin\n\t\t\t- a\n\t\t- Marriage as a Sacrament\n\t\t\t- Marriage is an ACT of the CHURCH\n\t\t\t\t- Marriage is a human reality that many people engage in and live, not just Christians\n\t\t\t\t\t- Love each other, raise their kids, fulfill their responsibiltiies, mature and become better persons...\n\t\t\t\t- When a person is baptized, he is incorporated into the community of the Chruch...==his entire life ‚Äî actions, loving, being, growing ‚Äî is collocated on a different plane==\n\t\t\t\t\t- E.G. identifying as Atenean, or joining the Glee Club\n\t\t\t\t- A baptized person assumes his repsonsibilities as a member of the Church...marriage specifices the general responsibility assumed in baptism\n\t\t\t\t- Christ speaks through the community of the Church to the world\n\t\t\t\t\t- He shows his fidelity to his people, his desire to save and to draw us to the fullness that he offers\n\t\t\t\t- By baptism, the baptized's married life becomes a language of Christ and the Church\n\t\t\t\t\t- It is not just their own life, but also of the Church to which they belong\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- E.G. being a Glee Club singer\n\t\t\t- Marriage is SALVIFIC\n\t\t\t\t- The historical development of the question\n\t\t\t\t\t- Augustine/1\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- Literal truth of Genesis 3: there were no uncontrolable passions because everything was according to reason/will of God; sex was only for procreation\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- The first sin created a rupture between man and God, between man and his better self\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- Breakdown in man's wholeness -\u003e man finds himself drawn to different directions\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- Paul: I do what I do not want to do and don't do what I really want to do\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- The disruption of the relation between God and man also happened internally to man\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- Concupscience (state of rebellion of man against God) took this form: the sex act was now governed by pleasure rather than the desire to cooperate with God's will\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- Sex in marriage is not always for procreation...sex is inevitable in marriage, thus sin is inevitable in marriage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- Marriage is the default vocation of the weak\n\t\t\t\t\t- Augustine/2\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- Over time, his theology softened\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- Marriage could be salvific in a negative sense\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- Each man should have his own wife...do not deprive one another so that Satan may not tempt you\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- Sex is limited to one's partner, making it less frequent\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- Marriage is redemptive in a negative sense\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- it limits sinfulness\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- it is a damage control measure\n\t\t\t\t\t- Gaudium et spes\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- The intimate partnership of life and love is rooted in the ==contract of the partners==, in their ==irrevocable consent==\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- Married love is uniquely expressed and perfected in the marraige act\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- noble and honorable\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- the truly human performance of these acts fosters the self-giving they signify and enriches the spouses in joy and gratitude\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- These paradigm-changing insights concern:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- the understanding of marriage from *contract* (exchange of rights) to consortium totius vitae\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- breaks new ground in understanding the meaning of the sexual act\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- Augustine: \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- original justice: procreation was faithful to God's intention\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- original sin: pleasure is sinful\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- GS: the marital act ==expresses conjugal love and perfects the love== between husband and wife\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- Comments about GS:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- enlarged the understanding of marriage ==from mere contract to a life-partnership==\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- contract: rights, sexual rights\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- marriage: unrecognizable as a relationship between friends\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- Contract model saw sexual act as a right (biological POV). Considered moral when intended for procreation. Sexual act was sole ingredient of marriage, unrelated to other realities (e.g. care, understanding, responsibility, friendship)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- Contract model is reflected in discipline of Catholic Church\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- E.G. minimum age for marriage (14 for girls and 16 for boys)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- marriage is dissolved if not consummated\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- physical impotence is an impediment to marriage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- Offers a broader and more human understanding as an intimate life-partnership\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- composed of many ingredientts like communication, trust, etc\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- not monolithic, but multifaceted\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- In this context, the sexual act ==can attain and be understood in all its depth and richness==\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- The marital act expresses and perfects the love of the spouses. It's not an isolated reality; ==its meaning is rooted in and arises from the life/love of the spouses==\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- sacramental structure: if the love is real, it must be expressed in an external way. at the same time, the external expression (as a sign) is set apart by the meaning it bears\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- Remember FC: a person is a body informed by an immortal spirit, and a spirit that expresses itself in a body\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- Sexual acts are fully human only if they are part of the love by which man and woman commit themselves to each other\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- The meaning of the act is not only in the act but in the life they live. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- Not merely a passing, momentary pleasure\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- 3rd possible meaning for the sexual act: expression and perfection of love.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- The effect and cause of deeper love\n\t\t\t\t- In what way is marriage said to be salvific/redemptive?\n\t\t\t\t\t- Thesis:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- There's a proportion and similarity in meaning between the ==natural reality (symbol) and the sacred (revealed)==\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- E.G. preservative quality of oil -\u003e preservation of new life; bread and wine -\u003e spiritual nourishment\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- Spouses can become better persons ‚Äî ==marriage is a context in which spouses mature and grow==; they can learn to love and sacrifice\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- \"Becoming better persons\": good human quality to symbolize and make concrete \"salvation\" understood as fuller life with God\n\t\t\t\t\t- More positive interpretation of marriage is in response to what Waite and Gallagher call ==\"Myths of post-marriage culture\"==\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- Divorce is usually the best answer for kids when the marriage becomes unhappy. *But is divorce always the best answer?*\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- Marriage is all about children; if there's none, spouses may as well break up. But marriage is not all about children; *getting and staying married has a powerful effect on the well-being of adults*\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- Rebutting the claim that marriage may be good for men but bad for women\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- Promoting marriage and marital obligation puts women at risk for domestic violence, and divorce can help women escape this; W and G cite a lot of studies that counter this\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- Marriage is a private matter, and no outsider should be allowed to interfere...\n\t\t\t\t\t- Practical consequences of this deconstruction:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- As marriage ceases to be vital to children, single motherhood is elevated in status. It's no longer just a family tragedy; it's just another personal option in a freedom loving world\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- Higher expectations of marriage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- Marriage becomes just one of the equally valid lifestyles\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- Marriage is demoted from uniquely honored relationship -\u003e one of the possibile relationships (and no one should interfere)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- For law practitioners: marriage is a part of continuum of commitment ratehr than a distinctive and distinct relationship\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- At the heart of this deconstruction: ==the attempt to demote marriage from a unique public commitment (supported by law, custom, society, religion) to a private relationship terminable at will==\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- This demotion is done in the name of choice and freedom, but ==reimagining marriage as a purely private relation does not expand anyone's choices==\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- Instead, it takes away from the individual marriage itself: the choice to enter a uniquely powerful and life-enhancing bond\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- way more durable than the immediate shifting feelings of two persons\n\t\t\t\t\t- The Marriage Bargain: Is marriage a public institution governed by laws and supported by society?

This is responsibility assumed\n\t\t\t\t- Baptism: all Christians take on the responsibility to ==share the prophetic mission of Christ== as a member of the Christian community\n\t\t\t\t- This general responsibility is specified by the vocation, way of life we choose ‚Äî married couples, single, religious, priests\n- **The Role of Faith**\n\t- The difficulty raised by Mackin: ==the sacramentality of marraige seems \"automatic\", almost \"magical\"==\n\t\t- as if all one needs to do is to be baptized (C. 1055. 2)\n\t- The popular belief: our marriage is unhappy because we have not received God's blessing\n\t- Faith\n\t\t- Man's COMPREHENSIVE \"yes\" to God's revelation of himself and of his saving plan for us\n\t\t- Includes many elements, engages all the human faculties\n\t- Faith and the Sacrament\n\t\t- The sacrament is primarily the ==\"act of God\"== (according to the DSD no. 46)\n\t\t\t- It is God's action in the ritual, God animates the fusion (of the human act and the cultural symbol) with his intention and meaning\n\t\t\t- He uses this fusion to do good things in the participants, acting in their whole persons in an effort to draw them to Himself\n\t\t- As an act of God, the sacrament therefore implies certanity, regarding which, the following must be said:\n\t\t\t- The CERTANITY PRINCIPLE (\"opus operatum\" or \"ex opere operato\")\n\t\t\t\t- It is God himself who works in the human reality\n\t\t\t\t- Not the priest who merely acts as an agent/intermediary\n\t\t\t\t- Not the ritual or the symbolic act\n\t\t\t- But emphasis on the certanity principle (that it is God himself who works in the sacraments) led to certain exaggerations that ignored the human responsibility and cooperation dimension\n\t\t\t\t- E.G. master of ceremonies turned missal to wrong page\n\t\t\t\t- This led to Mackin's criticism\n\t\t\t- Augustine and Pelagius' clarification: men are graced not against their will but according ot their cooperation\n\t\t\t\t- The water tank image?\n\t\t\t\t- Self-righteousness: the sin against the Holy Spirit (see Matthew 12, 32)\n\t\t\t\t- Jesus at the door (Rev 3, 20)\n\t- Faith and the Sacrament of Marriage\n\t\t- the intention to participate in any sacrament -\u003e the intention to participate in a ==\"human ritual/reality\"== in which we believe ==Christ is present and working==\n\t\t\t- Christian marriage: the intention to participate in the human reality of marriage acknowledged explicitly as a XT event (i..e. in which Christ works and is present to reveal and to save)\n\t\t- This intention is directed by a ==FAITH that BELIEVES in God who reveals himself in Jesus Christ==, who lives and works in the Church, a Church which continues his presence and work in the world precisely through human realities\n\t\t- Thus, the necessity of baptism ‚Äî not merely in the fact of baptism, but baptism that is ==lived in our daily life==\n\t\t- Thus, not AUTOMATIC\n\t\t\t- it is a ==human endeavor to cooperate==\n\t\t\t- and so, ==human responsibility==\n\t\t\t- \"Man is graced not against his will but according to his cooperation\"\n- **Summary and Conclusion**: Difference between sacramental and non-sacramental marraige\n\t- The difference is on the ==level of meaning== , not on the level of empirical reality. \n\t\t- The marraige between the baptized is not necessarily better, or that between non-baptized necessarily worse, or little chance of success\n\t- On the level of meaning: the baptized spouses are aware of ==another level of meaning, of an added responsibility==\n\t- The witness of Christian spouses is clearer in this sense: ==it is not an individual/isolated \"statement\" but a witness of communities==...\n\t\t- ...all over the world and over time, of many people striving to remain faithful to each other, struggling to be good parents, striving to form their children in the values of Christ\n\t\t- We see couples encouraging and helping each other fulfill their responsibilties (e.g. Marriage encounter)\n\t- Because there is an added meaning, there is another level of responsibility incumbent upon the Christian spouses. Their married life is not just a natural reality but also a ==ministry, a participation in the salvific mission of Christ==\n\t\t- There is an awareness of the need to ==open== their hearts and minds, their dispositions, their marriage ‚Äî their entire being and relationship ‚Äî ==to God's grace and transforming action==\n\t\t- E.G. We study harder for a final exam because it has heavier weight; the Blue Eagles practice more seriously and play with greater effort and hassle in the finals than in elimniations. This is because of the ADDED meaning\n\t\t- The certainity principle means that ==God's presence and grace is most certainly present== in the \"pipelines\", and our stance is that of ==openness to God's action, our responsibility is that we desire that He act in our hearts and in our lives.== But God does not bulldoze his way into our hearts and sanctify and save us whether we like it or not. Thus, ==we are graced not against our will but according to our cooperation.==\n\n---\n#### Orals\n**Guidelines:**\n- 10 MINUTES MAX\n- Introduce your thesis by talking about its location/context in the chapter (what went before, what follows)\n\n**Thesis:**\nMarriage is a Christian sacrament‚Äîan official act of  the Church; it is revelatory; it is redemptive/salvific. The redemptive capacity of marriage underwent a development, from  Augustine/1, Augustine/2, and finally to the game changing   insights of Gaudium et Spes 48-49.\n\n\n**Outline:**\n1. Provide thesis and its context\n\t1. General topic: the sacramentality of marriage\n\t2. What went before: Marriage in general in SS (old testament stories)?\n\t3. What went after: Waite and Gallagher on myths of post marriage culture (practical application)\n2. Expound on redemptive capacity of marriage\n\t1. It helps spouses become better persons by providing them a context in which spouses mature and grow, by learning to love and to sacrifice\n\t2. It is a human reality in which believers see and recognize that God is present, and is working in a very special and palpable way\n\t3. The symbolization makes our  \"salvation\" with God more concrete -\u003e with God, we have fuller lives\n3. How did the redemptive capacity of marriage develop? (main)\n\t1. Augustine/1: Marriage is seen as the default vocation of the weak\n\t\t1. Genesis 3: there were no uncontrollable passions because everything was according to the reason/will of God\n\t\t\t1. sex was only for procreation; this is faithful to God's intention\n\t\t2. After the occurence of the first sin, which created a rupture between man and God, sex became an act governed by pleasure, instead of the desire to cooperate with God's will\n\t\t\t1. Manifestation of concupscience (tendency of man to sin; state of rebellion of man against God)\n\t\t\t2. Pleasure is sinful\n\t\t3. Sex in marriage isn't always for procreation -\u003e sex is inevitable in marriage -\u003e sin is inevitable in marriage\n\t2. Softened in Augustine/2: Marriage could be salvific/redemptive in a negative sense. How?\n\t\t1. Each man should have his own wife...do not deprive one another so that Satan may not tempt you\n\t\t2. Sex is limited to your exclusive partner, making it less frequent\n\t\t3. Limits sinfulness\n\t\t4. Damage control measure\n\t\t5. This can be seen in historical context: marriage was seen as a contract model\n\t\t\t1. Utilitarian + objective; collective needs \u003e individual needs\n\t\t\t\t1. E.G. acquring good in-laws, increasing family labot\n\t\t\t2. Sexual act was seen as a right (biological POV)\n\t\t\t3. Sexual act was sole ingredient of marriage, unrelated to other realities (e.g. care, understanding, responsibility, friendship)\n\t3. Gaudium et Spes 48-49: \n\t\t1. Overview:\n\t\t\t1. Marriage is expanded from mere contract model to life partnership. A broader and more human understanding\n\t\t\t2. Foundation of relationship is still the partners' contract, their irrevocable consent\n\t\t\t3. Expansion: The marital act expresses and perfects the love of the spouses. \n\t\t\t\t1. How? the truly human performance of the act fosters the self-giving they signify and enriches the spouses in joy and gratitude\n\t\t\t\t\t1. Consortium totius vitae: reciprocal self-giving of the spouses\n\t\t\t\t2. It is no longer an isolated reality; its meaning is rooted in and arises from the life/love of the spouse\n\t\t\t\t\t1. Remember: marriage is a sacrament. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t1. If the love is real, it must be expressed in an external way.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2. At the same time, the external expression (as a sign) is set apart by the meaning it bears\n\t\t\t\t\t2. Sexual acts are fully human only if they are a part of the love where man and woman commit themselves to each other\n\t\t\t\t\t3. The meaning of the act is not only in the act but in the life they live. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t1. not just passing pleasure\n4. Summary and Conclusion\n\t1. As a Christian sacrament, marriage has the capacity to redeem us from not just sin, but from a reality where we're disconnected w/ God\n\t2. However, it wasn't always seen this way; exemplified by Augustine's writings, marriage was seen as an environment that encouraged sin because it enabled sexual acts -\u003e individualistic pleasure\n\t3. Thanks to Gaudium et Spes, we understand marriage as a partnership, one of reciprocal self-giving. Now, these marital acts are seen as expressions + perfections of the spouses' love because they foster this self-giving. Not just limited to the act; their lives are also enriched with joy and gratitude. Hence its redemptive capacity.","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.727605418Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2022-04-26":{"title":"2022-04-26","content":"## Philo 12\n#philosophy #religion \n### Balangkas\n#### Modyl 5: Pakikibagay sa Pagsubok\n**A.

And these silences are everywhere. Films, news, literature, science, city planning, economics, the stories we tell ourselves about our past, present and future, are all marked ‚Äì disfigured ‚Äì by a female-shaped ‚Äúabsent presence‚Äù. This is the gender data gap.\n\n\n\u003e For these women, the consequences of living in a world built around male data can be deadly.\n\n\u003e The gender data gap is both a cause and a consequence of the type of unthinking that conceives of humanity as almost exclusively male.\n\n\u003e Designers may believe they are making products for everyone, but in reality they are mainly making them for men.

In order to make this point stronger, the article is framed to spotlight the dangers of male-centered design. This was done by focalizing the perspectives of women, so that we, the audience, can fully empathize with them. A variety of examples were given, ranging from the gadgets they use to the workplaces they occupy (i.e. the size of phones being too large to the temperatures of offices being too low). These were backed by studies and statistics, like the accuracy rate of speech recognition software (70% better for men) and the likelihood of injury and death in a car crash (47% and 17%, respectively). Here, we can see intertextuality at work; referencing to outside texts shows us the gravity of these design decisions. I appreciate this kind of focalization because it gives attention to minorities: not just women, but also people who are POC, LGBTQIA+, neurodivergent, etc. This may seem biased to others (e.g. the counter \"All Lives Matter\" to \"Black Lives Matter\"). However, I believe this kind of focalization is needed because we live in an inequitable world where some types of people are more privileged than othrs; thus, it's important to spotlight perspectives that are undervalued.\n","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.727605418Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2022-05-02":{"title":"2022-05-02","content":"## PHILO 12\n#philosophy #religion \n### 6.01 Pagtatakda, Paglalarawan \u0026 Pagsasapormula\n*Restriction, Illustration and Formulation*\n*Sakop na bahagi ng teksto | ¬ß¬ß28-34, pp.102-105*\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDk4Vi-l53U\n#### Noto\n- Hal.

Ngunit tanggihan o iwasan man natin ito, tila walang pagmamahalan ang maaaring makatakas sa paparating na pagwawalay na dala ng kamatayan.\n- At kung ang aking pag-asa ay isang pag-asa sa aking mga kaibigan at minamahal na siya ring mamamatay, nagiging posible pa ba ang pag-asa?\n- Ngunit tanong ni Marcel,¬†**\"Pagkanag-iisa ba ang huling salita?\"**¬†(¬ß58, p.122). Ang lahat nga ba ng ating pagkakaibigan at pagmamahalan ay humahantong lamang sa pagpapaalam? Tila taliwas din ito sa ating karanasan. \n- Bakit may nararanasan tayong ==isang¬†**uri ng katibayan**¬†sa ating pagbubuklod sa iba?== Bakit tila kapag may katapatan ang pagmamahal natin sa isang tao, nadarama natin na tila ==hindi ito maaaring matapos, na tila walang hangganan ito?== Paano maaaring unawain kung gayon ang nararanasan nating¬†**katotohanan**¬†ng ating pagbubuklod sa ating mga kaibigan kung ito pala ay simula‚Äôt sapul hahantong lamang sa pagkawasak?\n\n### Lecture Notes\n- pakikiapagkapuwa-looban\n- have u ever experienced gratitutde in the midst of darkness? this is ==collateral beauty==\n\t- E.G. spending time with your loved ones during the pandemic\n- Our loved ones have limitations too; hangganan/limitasyon\n\n\u003e \"==Inaasahan kita alang-alang sa amin.==\" Iyan, marahil, ang pinakatumpak na paglahad at pagsasabalangkas sa kilos at gawa na taglay...ng salitang 'umasa.' \"==Kita...sa amin.==\" Ang tigas-ulong tiyaga sa pagmumuni-muni lamang ang makapaglilitaw, mula sa kilos ng umaasa, sa 'kita' at 'kami' na iyan.

It means ==being faithful==. If we have a close relationship, there'll always be times when we have shortcomings...a friendship is only strong if we remain faithful throughout all these times\n\t- We are able to make a horizon where the good within each other triumphs\n\t- This is ==fidelity==\n- Through fidelity to a human being, I become aware of the presence of an absolute Thou\n\t- absolute = fullness, overflowing, so great I cannot conceive of it...but I am aware of it\n\t- Marcel: \"The cement which binds us together...we are faithful to each other because in our fragility, there is an absolute Thou who in his presence binds us together like cement. He's the one who cements us\"\n\t- This absolute Thou is the ground ==(the cement)== of our home\n- Our temptations to despair have most often to do with our relations with others... E.G. when the people we love die...but the absolute Thou is what lets us keep hope\n\t- Marcel: if I am faithful to a friend, and vice versa, then I can experience my friend as ==immortal==. To love somebody, Marcel says, is to be able to say ‚ÄòYou at least will not die'‚Äù. \n\t- Not because I am a spoiled child who does not want to accept death, but because having been faithful or having tried one's best to be faithful to a fellow human being...the goodness, depth and the reality of the fellow human being has been experienced by one, and one is aware that ==goodness cannot simply be destroyed.==\n\t- And so one faces the death of that fellow human being, but is aware that the ==death is simply not the last word==\n\t- This comes from the perspective of...not as a small child refusing to accept reality, but as a human being who is ==faithful to the reality he has experienced==\n\t- Why ==AT LEAST==?\n\t\t- He has not experienced everybody, but he has experienced at least this one person\n\t\t- And he's aware that this one person is immortal\n\t\t- But he says at least because then he suspects...perhaps everybody is like that too...also immortal, also cannot die\n- Thus, part of being faithful is ==the refusal to yield to the temptation to give up==\n\t- The refusal to say \"Okay, life is really like that...that's the end of everything\"\n\t- Fidelity is not something that depends on me...it is the very ==goodness, depth, and richness== of what I have experienced calls me to be faithful to it\n\t- It is a call which if I do not answer, I am unfaithful. It's a call to be answered in fidelity\n- The presence of the absolute Thou makes me realize that it's not only a matter of being faithful to my friend, but also to be faithful to the absolute Thou, who is ==the cement which holds us together.==\n\t- Marcel: We always have this temptation...to yield to say...darkness is the last word, life has no meaning, to lose hope...==to yield to this temptation is to be unfaithful to the absolute Thou== who holds together the limited and finite thou that we human beings are to each other\n\t- No matter how hopeless things seem to be, there's always this call to be faithful to one's friends. And then to other human beings too. Because if one is faithful to one's friends, one gets the gift of being able to realize that ==even the human beings who are not once friends are also immortal. ==\n- Marcel's remarks\n\t-  One cannot hope without constantly ==overcoming the temptation to despair==\n\t\t- We always have this temptation\n\t- Hope is a kind of a tension between the ==horizon of the infinite== and the ==early detail of the finite. ==\n\t\t- E.G. father whose son has gone off to the war and from whom he has not heard anything\n\t\t- In the infinite horizon, he believes that he will see his son again. if not in this life, in the life to come\n\t\t- But in the finite life, he longs to see his son right here on earth.\n\t\t- And hope moves in both of them\n\t\t\t- He's aware that he will see his son again in the life to come\n\t\t\t- But part of hope is to continue longing to see his son in this life... to continue looking for him, to continue praying to see him\n\t\t- In other words, Marcel's philosophy is different from the philosophy of those who would say: \"Let's have closure now\"\n\t\t\t- There is no closure. But that does not mean to say that there should be a constant agony, but they're a constant hope...even in the finite, from which nothing has been heard\n\t- What shall it be like when we finally ==enter the horizon of the absolute Thou?==\n\t\t- He uses Greek word: ŒΩœåœÉœÑŒøœÇ (nostos)\n\t\t\t- a common theme in Greek literature that is used to describe a hero's journey home.\n\t\t\t- Filipino word is pag-uwi: What Filipinos feel ==going home==\n\t\t\t- Going home: we have been away from it, but we've been carrying it within ourselves, and now at last we've arrived. I've returned to the familiar. I've returned to where I've always been, to where I've always wanted to be.\n\t\t\t- at the same time, it would also be an experience, and an experiencing of something new\n\t- Hope in myself is always ==faithfulness==\n\t\t- I can hope, and I can always overcome the temptation the darkness is final....\n\t\t- overcoming it through fidelity, through faithfulness...to our friends...and to an absolute Thou\n\n#### Sagutin \n\u003e _Tanong 1_: Ipaliwanag at pagmunihan ang linyang ito mula sa lektura ni Padre Roque Ferriols: ‚ÄúTo love somebody, Marcel says, is to be able to say ‚ÄòYou at least will not die'‚Äù (05:10-05:19).\n\n\u003e _Tanong 2_: Ipaliwanag at pagmunihan ang linyang ito mula sa lektura ni Padre Roque Ferriols: ‚ÄúHope is a kind of a tension between the horizon of the infinite and the earthly detail of the finite‚Äù (13:20-13:42).\n\n\n**Balangkas:**\n- Tanong: ‚ÄúHope is a kind of a tension between the horizon of the infinite and the earthly detail of the finite‚Äù \n- Hope operates in two realms:\n\t- Earthly detail of the finite: where possibilities are limited\n\t\t- It is often us people who put up limitations...setting up expectations on what should happen and when\n\t\t- In this view, experiences are established already based on calculations\n\t\t- This can be seen in \"Umaasa ako na...\"\n\t- Horizon of the infinite: where the possibilities are endless\n\t\t- as a method of surpassing, hope often exceeds our expectations\n\t\t- When we hope, we believe that it'll happen, even if we don't know HOW. \n\t\t- In this views, experiences are still being shaped\n\t\t- This can be seen in \"Umaasa ako...\"\n- The tension of hope is best seen in disappointment. Example: the father whose son has gone off to the war and from whom he has not heard anything\n\t- But in the finite life, he longs to see his son right here on Earth, in his life...\n\t\t- Notice how there is a set time and place\n\t- In the infinite horizon, he believes that he will see his son again. If not in this life, in the life to come\n\t- Recall that last sentence. The father easily could've succumbed to despair if he certainly claimed that he would see his son during his lifetime on Earth. Instead, he opened himself up to endless possibilities, one of which includes another liftime. As a hopeful person, the father is divided between his earthly desires and his acceptance of the unknown.\n\t- It is hope that motivates him to continue looking and praying for his son. There is no guarantee that he'll get closure.\n\t- Here, we see fidelity. To hope is to be faithful to someone, and part of being faithful is the refusal to give up.\n\t-  \"Umaasa ako sa Iyo.\"\n- Summary: \n\t- When we're able to contemplate dualities, we let go of the need for certanity. And this humbles us. \n\t- I believe that this humility can help us make better decisions in life.\n\n**Speech:**\n\nAno ang ibig sabihin ng \"Hope is a kind of tension between the horizon of the infinite and the earthly detail of the finite?\" Sa pananaw ko, nakikita sa linyang ito ang kahalagahan ng mga magkaugma na kabaligtaran. Walang pag-asa kung walang kadiliman; meron tayong konsepto ng walang hangganan dahil magintindihan tayo ng konsepto ng limitasyon.\n\nKumikilos ang pag-asa sa mga kabaligtaran na ito. Sa mundo ng tao,  may limitasyon ang mga posibilidad. Itinatag at naayos na ang mga karanasan kasi binabatay ito sa mga kalkulasyon: kung ano at kailan ang dapat mangyari sa hinaharap. Sa isang banda, may malawak na abot-tanaw na walang hangganan sa posibilidad. Dito, hinuhubog ba ang mga karanasan dahil palagi humihigit ang mga inaasahan ng tao ang pag-asa, bilang metodo ng paglampas. Kaya, walang pakialam ang pag-asa sa kalulasyon, o sa ibang salita, sa *papaano*.\n\nMadalas na nakikita ang pag-asa sa pagkabigo, tulad sa halimbawa ni Fr. Ferriols: pumunta ang anak sa giyera, at wala pang narining ang kanyang ama mula sa kanya. Sa buhay ng ama (na may hangganan), gusto niyang makita ang kanyang anak ngayon, sa mundong ito. May  nakatakdang panahon at lugar. Sa abot-tanaw ng walang hangganan, naniniwala siya na makikita niya ulit ang anak niya. Kung hindi ngayon, (sa habang-buhay na ito), sa hinaharap na lang (o sa darating na habang-buhay). \n\nKung sigurado ng ama na makikita niya ang kanyang anak sa panahon ng kanyang buhay sa mundo, maaaring madaling sumuko ang ama. Pero naging bukas ang isip niya sa mga iba't ibang possibilidad, katulad ng ibang habang-buhay. Bilang taong umaasa, dumadanas ang ama ng dalawang kabaligtaran: ang kanyang mga makamundong nais at ang kanyang pagtanggap sa lingid na hinaharap.\n\nDahil sa pag-asa, nagpatuloy siya naghahanap at nagdadasal para sa anak niya, kahit walang garantiya. Dito, maaaring makikita ang katapatan. Ang pagiging umaasa ay ang pagiging tapat sa aming kapwa, at ang pagiging tapat ay ang pagtanggi na sumuko sa matagal na kadiliman. \"Umaasa ako sa Iyo, kahit anong mangyari sa atin.\" \n\nAno ang pwede nating natutunan dito? Kapag tayo tumatanggap ng kabaligtaran nang sabay-sabay, binitawan natin ang aming nais para sa katiyakan. Naniniwala ako na nagtutulong ang pagpapakumbaba na ito sa amin; mas handa na tayong harapin ng halihaw sa mundo.\n\n\n\nThe father easily could've succumbed to despair if he was certain that he would see his son during his lifetime on Earth. Instead, he opened himself up to endless possibilities, one of which includes another lifetime. \nBilang taong umaasa, dumadanas ang ama ng dalawang kabaligtaran: ang kanyang mga makamundong nais at ang kanyang pagtanggap sa lingid na hinaharap.\n\nBecause of hope, he continues looking and praying for his son, even if there's no guarantee that he'll get closure. Here, we see fidelity. To hope is to be faithful to someone, and part of being faithful is the refusal to give up even during dark times. \"Umaasa ako sa Iyo, kahit anong mangyari sa atin.\" \n\nWhat can we take away from this? When we're able to simultaneously contemplate dualities, we let go of the need for certanity, which humbles us. And I believe that this humility can help us navigate life better in a polarizing world. \n\n\n\n\n#### Pagmarka\n- Tumpak, malinaw, maayos at kung sakali‚Äôy may kabatiran ang sinulat, binahagi, o binigayna sagot sa tanong ng guro. \n- May malinaw na ebidensiya na nakilala, naunawaan, at gamay ng mag-aaral ang ideya/paksa na tinutukoy ng takdang aralin, kasama ang pinakamahalagang mga detalye nito. \n- Hindi naging paligoy-ligoy ang sinabi o binahagi.

It is responsible for birthing realities and even denying them depending on how well we can use or manipulate them.¬†In its barest sense, language refers to the meaning-making tools we use to communicate. In this lecture, we discuss how language serves as a system where we experience reality.\n\n##### Notes\n- **Rhetoric**\n\t- study of figures\n- Figurative meaning heavily relies on the connections that got built up over time\n\t- Since they contain within them a history, they change meaning throughout time\n\n#### Figurative Language and Rhetoric\nIn the previous section, we discussed how language has the power to not only shape but to create realities. However, there is also the truth that with it comes the power to produce realities that are loaded with biases. The challenge then is to produce new meanings and shape an alternate reality with the help of language's dynamic nature.\n\n##### Notes\n- rhetoric is how language persuades\n- biases are built into our language\n\n#### Language and Framing\nSo, we already know that language is a part of our sociopolitical and sociocultural fabric and because of that, the words that we use are not simply words. Because they carry biases within them, they are ideologically charged. How do we then detect ideology in language? The (last) lecture embedded below discusses this and more.\n##### Notes\n- ideology will show you an ordering of the world based on the differences of people\n- will put forward a moral/ethical position\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AevWkp9uRfA\n\n#### Summary\n**BIG CONCEPTS ABOUT LANGUAGE, IDEOLOGY \u0026 NARRATIVES**\n-   By language, we don't just mean words but images, gestures, and other semantic systems. It is a ==system where meanings are created, negotiated, valued, and even devalued.¬†==\n-   The way we use language is ==a way of framing.== In this perspective, language also contributes the ==unequal social relations.==\n-   Although language reflects reality, it is also responsible for creating, shaping, and influencing it.\n-   Figurative language is found everywhere--not just in poetry, but in ==our everyday strife.==\n-   Language is nearly everything and what we say about something helps shape the way we view something. Therefore, it is important to always ask ourselves: ==is my language aligned to the values and principles of civility, compassion, and social justice?== Or am I helping contribute to the great divide and perennial inequality?","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.727605418Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2022-05-16":{"title":"2022-05-16","content":"## Theo 13\n#philosophy #religion \n### Chapter 3: Towards a Moral Theology\n- 3 parts:\n\t- \"Micro\" approach\n\t- \"Macro\" approach\n\t- Applying these 2 approaches to sexual questions\n- When we think of sin, we usually think in terms of ==what we do== (micro)\n- But our actions do not simply in the realm of actions that come and go. They affect also the ==kind of person that we become== (macro).\n- WE BECOME WHAT WE REPEATEDLY DO.\n\n#### The \"Micro\" Approach ‚Äî Looking at the ACT\n*O'Neill and Black, Responding to Love in Love*\n\n- Distinction between a **human act** and a **non-human act** is based on ==freedom and knowledge.== \n\t- Expound: The more freedom + the greater the knowledge, the more human the act is; the less freedom + knowledge (e.g. person was forced, reflex act; I didn't know what I was doing, a little kid breaking something), the less human the act is. \n\t- Concerning KNOWLEDGE\n\t\t- not just consciousness (like sleepwalking), but also the knowledge that he is acting\n\t\t- Also awareness of the virtue/evil that he is doing\n\t\t- This clarity is not always present in moral matters; this lack is exemplified in the difference between ==\"head\" knowledge== (what I know) and ==\"heart knowledge\"== (what is important to me, what I value, what determines what I do)\n\t\t- What I know does not always govern/affect what I do\n\t- Concerning FREEDOM \n\t\t- inadequate understanding\n\t\t\t- freedom as the ability to do as one chooses/pleases\n\t\t\t- freedom from restraint, the less restraint, the more freedom\n\t\t\t- freedom as the ability to choose one over the other\n\t\t- a more adequate understanding of freedom\n\t\t\t- freedom is not an end/value in itself, but only instrumental\n\t\t\t- ==ability and responsibility== to direct our lives in accordance with ==our meaning and purpose==\n\t\t\t- does not exist in a vacuum, but in the context of what we understand to be our vocation, ==a Christian anthropology==\n\t\t\t- not only the ability to choose what I do, but also and especially what I would like to become\n\t\t\t- Freedom is therefore exercised on two levels:\n\t\t\t\t- ==what I do== ‚Äî doing good and avoiding evil (categorical)\n\t\t\t\t- ==what I become== ‚Äî becoming conformed to the image of God in whom I was created (transcendental)\n\t\t\t- John Paul II: acting is morally good when the choices of freedom conform with man's true good; the choices we make express the ==voluntary ordering of the person towards ultimate good==\n\t\t\t- Freedom is the ==pursuit of the ultimate good==, what God has created us to become, the best version of ourselves; it is the pursuit of excellence (MAGIS)\n\t- Freedom is related to \"virtues\" or good stable habits\n\t\t- E.G. bad habit of overeating: it's a habit not because it's one-time act, but a persistent pattern...it doesn't tend towards the authentic good of the over-eater\n\t\t- Virtue as a stable habit begins with ==particular acts repeated over time.==\n\t\t- Particular acts eventually lead to the formation of the virtue/habit; the habit makes the doing of particular acts easier; repeated acts strengthen the virtue/habit. Thus, there is a ==circular relationship== between particular acts and habit/virtue, between doing and becoming\n\t\t- Catholic tradition speaks of THEOLOGICAL and MORAL virtues\n\t\t\t- Theological virtues (e.g. faith, hope, charity): they \"facilitate\" ==our relationship with God==\n\t\t\t- Moral virtues (e.g. prudence, temperance, fortitude, justice): facilitate ==our relationship with others==\n\t\t\t\t- Human virtues; one need not be a believer in God to recognize their importance\n\t\t\t\t- Part of a mature responsible personality\n\t\t\t\t- Work in progress; part of the process of growing and maturing\n\t\t- Freedom is related to virtues in that ==we exercise our freedom in order to develop these virtues/good habits==\n- The **\"components\"** of a moral act. (Aside from freedom and knwoeldge, here's an added 3rd element to be able to diffrentiate between a \"grave\" and a \"minor\" human act)\n\t- **Freedom**\n\t\t- the more free I am in acting, the more responsible I am for my acts\n\t- **Knowledge**\n\t\t- the less I know, the less free I am\n\t- **(Grave) Matter**\n\t\t- Freedom and knowledge are ==subjective== elements while the gravity of the matter is ==objective.==\n\t\t- Examples of what gravity of the matter looks like:\n\t\t\t- Being attacked by a thief -\u003e seriousness of the injury\n\t\t\t- Being pressured to produce an unsafe vaccine -\u003e how many people die from it\n\t\t- Under this rubric, certain acts are objectively grave, independent of the freedom and knowledge of the person acting.\n\t\t- ==The more objectively grave an act is, the greater the justification should be.== Perhaps, in this context, we can speak of the comparability of values or the good.\n\t\t\t- Abortion in the case of ectopic pregnancy\n\t\t\t- Abortion because I cannot take care of anotehr child\n\t\t\t- Lying to one who has a right to the truth V.S. lying to one who does not have a right to the truth\n- There are other secondary considerations that can aggravate/mitigate the gravity of an act, and therefore the responsibility of the person\n\t- **CIRCUMSTANCE:** the use of superior force and treachery would aggravate; the timing may change the meaning of the act\n\t- **INTENTION of the ACTOR:** while the intention is primary to the actor, it is dangerous to place undue importance on the intention\n\t\t- After all, the road to hell is paved with good intentions\n- Conclusion\n\t- The uniqueness of the human response lies in the freedom and awareness that ==I (can!) shape myself and direct my life according to the image of God in whom I was created==\n\t- Virtues/good habits make our ==tending to the good \"easier\".==\n\t- Freedom is responsibly exercised when used to ==choose the authentic human good== (cateogrical) and when used to ==shape ourselves in the image of God in whom we were created== (transcendental)\n- Footnotes to Virtues/Values\n\t- General\n\t\t- Human goods/values/virtues perfect and complete the human person\n\t\t- By developing these values, persons move closer to the image of God in whom they were created (normative anthropology).\n\t\t- These values/virtues may not be developed perfectly; their realization is a work in progres\n\t\t- Persons are *homines viatores*, pilgrims, on the way to becoming, in the process of fuller realization, thus the importance of ==time and direction.==\n\t- Morality (the doing of the good/right) is not merely a matter of obeying the law but is related to ==the realization of values which are knowable through reason.==\n\t\t- On the basis of our experience of conscience, we asserted that we are drawn towards the good, and that we find satisfaction, joy, and fulfillment in the doing of the good. We experience this ==\"ought\" or \"moral imperative\"==\n\t\t- This ought or moral imperative is both OBJECTIVE and SUBJECTIVE\n\t\t\t- **OBJECTIVE:** because it's experienced as an imposition from the outside; one cannot change or be exempted from it, almost as though it were a physical law (e.g. gravity, sugar and dibaetes -\u003e it being wrong to kill)\n\t\t\t- **SUBJECTIVE:** because we recognize that the demands of this ought to correspond to and fulfill our inner desires welling from the depths of our hearts. The demands of this moral imperative is not something alien and external to ourselves; rather, they fulfill and satisfy the innermost longings of our hearts.\n\t\t- Thus the claim we made earlier is that ==there's connaturality (connected by nature) between man and value/good==\n\t- From VALUES to NORMS\n\t\t- The externally imposed objective norms are ==expressions of values== (e.g. laws of the land, traffic regulations, code of discipline in school, people's tranditions)\n\t\t- Norms are meant to articulate, promote, protect, and enforce these values\n\t\t- Norms, laws, and rules arise from and are based on values\n\t\t- Laws and other external codes do not stand by alone; they are based on these values\n\t\t- As we understand these values better, and ourselves and our circs better, ==it may be necessary to amend these rules to express and protect these values better.==\n\t\t\t- E.G. age of criminal liability, capital punishment, the earlier release of prisoners for good behavior, the protection of women and children, economic provisions of the Constitution, etc.\n\n#### The \"MACRO\" Approach \n- Intro\n\t- What I do doesn't remain simply on the level of the act that comes and goes. What I do, especially the acts that I do with full freedom + knowledge ==affect my \"being\",== or as we shall argue, ==affects the direction/orientation in which I'm moving.==\n\t- Insufficient to look at the acts alone; we need to go beyond the act to the ==actor== who remains, who is affected by the act, who is responsible for the act\n\t- The \"MICRO\" approach focuses on the dimensions of ==freedom and knowledge.== The macro approach adds the dimensions of ==person and time.==\n- **The Dimension of the PERSON** (Acts do not stand by themselves, existing in a vacuum)\n\t- Acts ==\"belong\"== to a person. An act is imputable to a person because he is the source of the act.\n\t- Acts ==affect== the person. \n\t\t- If he does a good deed and does it often, he forms a good habit, orienting him towards the good, solidifying his orientation towards the good, towards his better self. \n\t\t- If his act caused harm to another, he is sorry for it and would like to make reparations.\n\t- The person gives ==\"meaning\"== to the act. While acts have general meanings, the specific meaning of an act comes from ==the actor and from his \"intention\".==\n\t- He's affected by the act in another sense. A person's acts \"redound to his being\"; the acts contribute to the formation and development of habits (virtues) and ultimately to the kind of person he becomes. \n\t\t- In another context, we said these acts orient the actor to the kind of person he'll become.\n\t- The person is ultimately responsible for his acts. Before men (i.e. the law, the courts, the discipline committee, his conscience), and ultimately before God.\n\t- The person is ultimately responsible not only for his acts but for the ==kind of person he becomes.==\n\t- It's in this context that the authors also speak of the two level on which freedom is exercised: categorial and transcendental\n\t\t- The \"object\" of categorical freedom is ==particular choices==\n\t\t- The object of transcendental freedom ultimately revolves around ==God and the good==: either for God or against God, for the good, against the good.\n\t- Chronologically, particular acts are prior...through them, we eventually establish a kind of a ==fundamental orientation== towards the good (hopefully!) or towards evil. \n\t\t- Orientation towards the good makes the doing of good particular acts easier; repeated particular  acts strengthen and solidify our orientation towards the good.\n\t\t- Same applies vice versa for evil.\n- **Dimension of TIME:** \n\t- If there is a criticism we can offer to the ‚Äúsin as an act‚Äù model is that it is incomplete, and therefore an inaccurate picture of reality for these reasons.\n\t\t- Presents a static pictures; does not take into account that a person is a ==dynamic and progressive being==\n\t\t\t- Progressive: a person is not necessarily the same today as he was yesterday, or a year ago, or 15 years ago when he was an adolescent and now that he is more mature, now that he knows better, and thus more responsible. \n\t\t\t- Perhaps, the ‚Äúsame person‚Äù was acting, and yet it is not the same person and the significance of his act is different.\n\t\t- Man is in the ==process of becoming.== He is not a finished product.\n\t\t\t- This is why we are careful about the influence of others on us\n\t\t\t- Also the reason why on the one hand, we cannot give up on ourselves as well as on others. We are becoming, we have second chances and even third chances. There is no room for despair. But this also means we are capable of deteriorating.\n\t\t- Therefore, when we talk of sin, what is our area of discourse? We'd say in both ==particular acts== and in the ==fundamental orientation of the person==\n\t\t\t- There's a ==\"mutual causality\"== between particular acts and the general direction of the person. We start with particular acts, and eventually a direction is set; the direction makes the doing of those particular acts easier; and these repeated particular acts affirm and solidify the orientation.\n\t\t\t- In this sense, the serious and \"life threatening\" sin that could cut us off from God would be on the level of the ==fundamental orientation.==\n\t\t\t\t- It's a disposition we \"grow into\" slowly and gradually, to the point that we aren't aware of it\n\t\t\t\t- It's more grave because it's more difficult tog et out of, especially if we've profited from it + never caught\n\t\t\t\t- Our \"senses\" have become dulled to the guilt and inner conflict that we initially felt\n\t\t\t- That's not to say that there are no particular acts that could amount to this \"grave sin\" that could cut me off from God's love, and which could result in my \"self-destruction\"...but these do not happen often.\n\t\t\t- More often than not, these experiences are \"turning points\" that gradually dull our moral sense\n\n#### Sexual Sin \n*From the point of view of Christian anthropology + macro/micro perspectives*\n\n- **The Question of Non-Marital Sex** *(ref: Mattison, Non-Marital Sex)*\n\t- General Comments\n\t\t- Being married is obviously not the only requirement for virtuous sex; it's ==necessary but not sufficient==\n\t\t- Sex is the sort of activity that binds persons together, exclusively and over time; it also leads to children. In the language of the Christian tradition, sex is ==unitive and procreative.==\n\t\t\t- Procreation means: the spouses are open to new life, and that they're committed to raise, educate and form their child\n\t\t\t- Unitive means: through the sexual act, among other things, the spouses express and deepen their love and commitment to each other \n\t\t\t\t- (as seen in GS: the marital act expresses + perfects the love between spouses)\n\t\t\t- To be unitive is to be procreative: the best place to raise, form, and educate a child is in the context of a solid home, a secure \u0026 loving family context\n\t\t\t- To be procreative is to be unitive: children bring husband and wife closer to each other in their desire to raise, educate, and provide for the family\n\t\t- Thus, sexual relations should be done only in marriage because ==the meaning of the sex act can be realized fully only in marriage.==\n\t- Some Nuance\n\t\t- Although the claim here is that sex can only be virtuous in marriage, but not all non-marital sex are equally vicious. \n\t\t\t- E.G. sex between engaged couples v.s. casual one-night stands\n\t\t\t- There is a spectrum of virtue and vice, it is not a binary  question.\n\t\t- To say that marriage is the best place to raise children is not to say that children cannot be raised well by single parent or divorced or separated parent. But it would be ==more difficult.==\n\t\t- What may be said about this position: \n\t\t\t- it is possible to agree with the position stated here‚Äîthat the meaning of sex is only fully respected and done virtuously in a relationship that is exclusive, committed, and open to children\n\t\t\t- while that is the ultimate goal, it is possible to engage in sex for other reasons (pleasure, experiment, testing for sexual compatibility, even love but not yet certain if committed or exclusive) for the time being, and at a later point engage in sex that fulfills its meaning in an integral way. \n\t\t\t- In fact the argument continues: it is important that we do so to try out the relationship on all levels (including sex) before committing exclusively and permanently to the other person.\n\t\t- People who hold this position are in effect developing a habit of ==exercising their sexuality with incomplete meaning==‚Äîsex as an  instrument of pleasure, or even an expression of love that may be  genuine but not committed, and not exclusive, where sex means  something less, something different.\n\t\t\t- If we become what we repeatedly do, then we are orienting  ourselves towards a certain direction, we are creating a habit that may not be that easy to reverse.\n\t- 2 \"Objections\" to this position\n\t\t- **Why commitment?**\n\t\t\t- The objection is coming from understanding love as romantic feeling‚Äîthat if the feelings are gone as they inevitably will, why should I stay in the relationship? But this is not a reason for nor a solid foundation of marriage.\n\t\t\t- Marriage is a ==commitment to go through life together.==\n\t\t\t- A stable and secure family life is the best place to raise children.\n\t\t\t- ==Permanence makes possible certain facets of shared life== that  otherwise are not possible. \n\t\t\t\t- W and G say a lot about the values of permanence-you can plan over the long term, you can deepen and humanize your love for each other, you develop and complement your shared talents.\n\t\t\t- This is based on the assumption that there is something life-giving and enriching and true about doing so\n\t\t\t- As a commitment, it may feel like an obligation due to difficulties encountered, our own weaknesses, our own immaturity, even our selfishness. Marriage properly speaking is ==a source of true happiness and deep fulfillment.==\n\t\t- **But I can be committed without getting married, without that piece of paper!** (What can that piece of paper add to our love so fervent and true.‚Äù)\n\t\t\t- Via their public profession, they are proclaiming to society that this relationship is not only about themselves. ==It is something that larger society has a stake in.== It is not merely a private arrangement as BF/GF.\n\t\t\t\t- The public profession of vows adds something to the relationship, something that can be a powerful support for married couples. It is recognized to be so by society, by the state, by their religious community. The bond that they create is protected by the public weal; they cannot simply walk out of their marriage.\n\t\t\t\t\t- So yes, this \"piece of paper\" has power\n\t\t\t\t- A person who makes this claim about ‚Äúthe piece of paper‚Äù is probably afraid of its effects, or worse, he/she probably has no intention of keeping it.\n\t\t\t- As a committed relationship, marriage involves more than the momentary now. ==It remembers the past and celebrates a common future.==\n\t\t\t\t- McCormick: ==Marriage is the best way to humanize our sexuality.==  Sexual expression, to have full human meaning, to be nourishing, to avoid being trivialized, is not just about the present. As a language, it celebrates the past and guarantees the future. Sex and eros are fleeting, fickle, frustrating unless they are supported by philia and the friendship of a permanent covenant.\n\t\t\t\t- CCC: marriage helps to overcome self-absorption, egoism, pursuit of one one‚Äôs own pleasures, and to ==open oneself to the other in mutual self-giving.==\n\t\t\t\t- Ramsay: one‚Äôs capacity for responsible fidelity to the being and well-being of another makes marriage possible; man‚Äôs inclination towards selfishness and irresponsibility makes marriage (especially as a committed relationship protected by the state and society) makes marriage necessary.\n\t\t\t\t- Thus, while marriage celebrates the beauty of the human spirit and the heights to which it can soar, it is also intended to ==assist in protecting men and women from undue harm that can occur because of human frailty, selfishness, and irresponsibility.==\n- **The Question of Masturbation**\n\t- Catechism of the Catholic Church 2352:\n\t\t- Masturbation is ==an intrinsically and gravely disordered act== (nature of the act)\n\t\t- But in order to form an equitable judgement about the person‚Äôs moral responsibility (whether it is a ‚Äúsin‚Äù or nor)...\n\t\t- One must take into account ==his affective maturity, the force of acquired habit, conditions of anxiety and other psychological factors that may mitigate or aggravate moral responsibility.==\n\t- CCC 2352 makes three important statements:\n\t\t- Distinction between the ==nature of the act (objective)== and moral ==culpability (subjective/sin).==\n\t\t\t- The nature of the act is disordered (not a positive value, does not contribute to the growth/development of the person)\n\t\t\t- But it's not clear that this is always a sin (moral culpability)\n\t\t\t\t- That the person is morally responsible for the act\n\t\t\t\t- Or that the act necessarily affects his fundamental orientation\n\t\t\t\t- Or that it is a validation of an option for evil\n\t\t\t\t- Other factors need to be considered in order to form an equitable judgement as to whether it's a sin or not\n\t\t- The nature of the act is disordered, its not a positive value; it  militates against the authentic human good of the person\n\t\t- But even if the act is disordered (the nature of the act), masturbation ==does not automatically mean that it is a sin. ==\n\t\t\t- Killing is not a value but it is not always a sin. EG, accidental killing, self-defense, etc.\n\t\t\t- Sin does not consist only of a disordered act, although sin includes it.\n\t\t\t- Another factor must be included: namely, the perosn must be responsible (full knowledge and full freedom)\n\t- Why is the nature of the act disordered, it is not a value?\n\t\t- The act of masturbation can be isolating, when a person finds the ==locus of all pleasure in himself==...with the result that he cannot move on to the further stage of ==being able to share hmself with another person==, which is essential to his growth and development\n\t\t- A person may come to value and understand human sexuality more as a ==solitary experience== than a shared one\n\t\t- The full meaning of human sexuality in its best ‚Äúform‚Äù‚Äî love-giving, unitive, interpersonal. It is in this ==innate inability, incompleteness, its innate handicap to reflect and embody the richness of human  sexuality== that masturb is said to be negative, that it is not a value.\n\t\t- Masturbation can also indiciate self-centeredness, isolation, perhaps even evasion of personal responsibility. ==To exploit one‚Äôs sexuality in this manner deliberately and consistently creates a serious obstacle to personal growth.==\n\t\t- Kraft: Masturbation is particularly seductive because it is an easily accessible way to release sexual tension and explore genital pleasure and fantasies ==without personal vulnerability and investment.==\n\t\t\t- We do not have to risk rejection or failure  \n\t\t\t- Instead of engaging in a mature relationship, we can create a make-believe world where everything is possible.  \n\t\t\t- Masturbation can satisfy interpersonal yearnings (at least momentarily) while remaining an individual, safe and riskless affair.\n\t- CCC: To form an equitable judgement about a person‚Äôs moral responsibility, one must take into account other factors (not only the nature of the act). According to moral theologians, the following circumstances mitigate (lessen the gravity of) moral responsibility:\n\t\t- Masturbation could be expressive of a person's (especially an adolescent) effort ==to understand and integrate various elements of his identity as a sexual being==\n\t\t- Masturbation can also be ==symptomatic of many non-sexual conflicts== (e.g. boredom, poor self-image, frustration, loneliness)\n\t\t- Masturbation can point to ==\"unfinishedness\"==: the incomplete process of growth and development of a person.\n\t\t\t- To be unfinished (man on the way to becoming, the element of time) is not immoral or irresponsible, ==it is to be challenged to further growth. ==\n\t\t\t- But one must not choose to remain there or to prefer to be ‚Äúunfinished‚Äù.\n- **Responsible Parenthood and the Regulation of Birth**\n\t- Biological Introduction\n\t\t- Essentially, the **natural** method of contraception builds on the biological fact that the woman is not always fertile.\n\t\t\t- Natural contraception means timing the intercourse between husband and wife during the periods of natural infertility of the wife. \n\t\t\t- The difficulty associated with the natural method is  determining with greater accuracy when is the woman infertile.\n\t\t- The **artificial** methods are classified: surgical [vasectomy, ligation],  chemical [spermicide, pills], physical barriers [condom].\n\t- **Moral Evaluation**\n\t\t- **Casti connubii** [Pius X, 1932]\n\t\t\t- Augustine's view (in order to see the radicalness of the doctrine proposed in CC)\n\t\t\t\t- Concupiscent sex, that is to say, sexual intercourse that is not for procreation is sinful. It is contrary to God's design who had intended sexual intercourse for the propagation of the human race. Any use other than that ordained by God is sinful.\n\t\t\t\t- The only way to humanize the sexual act, to make it conform with the design of God the creator is by intending it for procreation.\n\t\t\t\t- If the spouses are also brought closer together in the process, and if they are able to express their love in the process, and if they are able to release their sexual tensions and experience pleasure in the process (the so-called ‚Äúsecondary‚Äù purposes of sex)- well and good but all these other purposes of the sexual act are subordinate to the primary purpose which is to procreate - and by primary, Aug means, ==procreation must be intended.==\n\t\t\t- CC contained these three statements:\n\t\t\t\t- The spouses are not forbidden to consider the secondary purposes of marriage provided t==he intrinsic nature of the act is preserved.==\n\t\t\t\t- The secondary purposes must remain subordinated to the primary purpose; that is to say, ==procreation must remain primary== (on the level of the intention of the spouses).\n\t\t\t\t- Provided, in other words, that ==the act remains open to the possibility of procreation.==\n\t\t\t- Although both Aug and CC affirm the primacy of the procreative over the unitive, that the secondary must always remain subordinate to the primary, as we have seen, CC meant something less than Aug.\n\t\t\t\t- By allowing the spouses to consider the secondary purposes [provided the intrinsic nature of the act is preserved-- meaning, they must not interpose anything in the act to prevent conception], CC meant ‚Äúby the primacy of the procreative purpose‚Äù that ==the primary purpose of procreation **should not be prevented**==\n\t\t\t\t- while ‚Äúthe primacy of the procreative purpose‚Äù in Aug means that ==the **primary purpose of procreation must be intended** by the spouses.==\n\t\t\t- Why it's a radical move\n\t\t\t\t- Since for Aug: Procreation must be intended, any form of contraception would be immoral because ==any form of contraception, natural or artificial, would have indicated a purpose and intention contrary to the design of God.==\n\t\t\t\t- On the other hand, because CC understands primacy to mean that the procreative must not be prevented, ==it was able to allow the natural method.==\n\t\t\t- In short...\n\t\t\t\t- The focus of Augustine is on ==the persons==: the persons must intend procreation.\n\t\t\t\t- On the other hand, the focus of CC is not on the person but on ==the act.== The act must be open to procreation (even if the spouses are not) by not interposing artificial means to frustrate the inherent purpose of the act and of the reproductive organs.\n\t\t- **Humanae Vitae** [Paul VI, 1967]\n\t\t\t- The doctrine proposed in Humanae Vitae 16: \n\t\t\t\t- If then there as serious motives to space out births, the church teaches that it is then licit to take into account the rhythms immanent in the generative functions for the use of marriage in the infecund periods only and in this way regulate birth without offending moral principles.\n\t\t\t- Reasons/arguments in support of this doctrine:\n\t\t\t\t- Contraception is artificial, therefore it is wrong [disvalue] and should never be freely chosen.\n\t\t\t\t\t- Artificial does not inherently mean bad, since many artificial things are good in the sense that they enable natural functions...==Artificial contraception impedes the natural functioning of the reproductive organs.==\n\t\t\t\t- The physiological argument focuses on the meaning of the sexual act.  It is understood as procreative [it transmits life].\n\t\t\t\t\t- a sexual act that is deliberately deprived of its capacity to  transmit life [e.g., by use of condoms, pills, etc.] ==violates the meaning of  the act. ==\n\t\t\t\t\t- The intention of the actors is ==not consistent with the finality of  the act== as intended by the Creator.\n\t\t\t\t- The intrinsic worth of human life argument\n\t\t\t\t\t- The argument focuses on the value of human life.\n\t\t\t\t\t- Contraceptive intercourse militates against and is hostile towards an important and fundamental human value, namely life. \n\t\t\t\t\t- Thus, the use of artificial contraception reveals ==an ‚Äúinternal disposition‚Äù against the value of life==‚Äîalmost like, you are a great poet and you don‚Äôt want to create poetry, you are a musician/lyricist and you refuse to create music.\n\t\t\t\t- The special act of creation argument\n\t\t\t\t\t- The argument is that the marital act is a privileged moment of special cooperation between man and God in the creation of new life. \n\t\t\t\t\t- When man and woman by a deliberate act frustrate the life-giving potential  such a marital act [through the use of artificial contraception] is an evidence of a will and an intention against life. ==Man turns his back to God and ‚Äúrefuses‚Äù to cooperate with God.==\n\t\t\t\t- Contraceptive intercourse violates the meaning of the act\n\t\t\t\t\t- The argument is that there is an inseparable connection between the procreative and unitive meanings/purposes of the sexual act. \n\t\t\t\t\t- This is ==willed by God== (in the laws of biology) and ==man cannot separate them on his own authority.==\n\t\t\t- Difficulties raised against the teaching of the HV\n\t\t\t\t- HV 12 asserts the inseparable connection of the unitive and procreative purposes of marriage but HV 16 allows the natural method.\n\t\t\t\t\t- Doesn't the natural method also separate the unitive and the procreative, certainly on the ==level of the intention?== It is precisely for the reason of avoiding conception that the spouses time their sexual contact during the infertile period of the wife.\n\t\t\t\t\t- Are the unitive and procreative purposes in fact inseparable?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- The woman is only fertile (that is conception is possible) only three days every 28 days; and the fertility age of the woman ends at a certain age (late forties?) \n\t\t\t\t\t\t- The causal relationship between insemination on the one hand and on the other fertilization, implantation and ultimately procreation is statistical, not necessary/inseparable. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t- No act of sexual intercourse has in itself an independent biological capacity for procreation. Otherwise, every act of of insemination would result in conception.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t- This biological capacity is dependent on many other conditions [the woman has ovulated; the sperm cells are healthy]\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- Thus, the claim that the relationship between unitive and procreative is not necessary/inseparable but ==statistical.==\n\t\t\t\t\t- Defenders of HV would respond that at least the use of the natural method leaves the ‚Äúact‚Äù open to the transmission of life - in the sense that nothing artificial is interposed to prevent the meeting of the egg and the sperm. \n\t\t\t\t\t- But the opponents of HV will say that the ‚Äúact may be open, but the husband and wife are not.‚Äù It almost becomes a game of Russian roulette.\n\t\t\t\t- The use of artificial contraception indicates an inferior kind of love\n\t\t\t\t- The general tenor of the document is that it understands the meaning of procreative only in the most minimal biological sense of the sperm fertilizing the egg.\n\t\t\t\t- The difficulty with the argument that focuses on particular acts.\n\n#### Implications for a Moral Decision\n*A summary?*\n\n- The primacy of a well-formed and a well-informed conscience  \n- The ‚Äúdecision‚Äù of conscience is personal, specific, one time; it does not legislate the rule [the use of artificial methods is ALWAYS right]\n- The relation between C/3 and the Magisterium\n\t- the 3 components?\n- HV obviously refers to the nature of the act (but to arrive at an HV obviously refers to the nature of the act (but to arrive at an equitable judgement about a person‚Äôs moral culpability, other factors must be taken into account...)\n\n---\n\n### Orals\n**Thesis:**\n- There are two components /aspects to an adequate moral evaluation: MICRO which looks at the particular acts and distinguishes between HUMAN and NON-HUMAN acts [on the basis of freedom, knowledge, matter, and circumstances]; and MACRO which looks beyond the acts and includes the actor who remains and is in the process of becoming.  \n- Masturbation is a gravely and intrinsically disordered act. But in order to an arrive at an equitable moral judgement, one must look at other factors: the individual‚Äôs affective maturity, the force of acquired habits, conditions of anxiety and other psychological and social factors that may extenuate freedom and therefore moral responsibility.\n- TL;DR: a moral evaluation of the act of masturbation\n\t- micro part\n\t- macro part\n\t- circumstances? situations? that can mitigate moral responsibility\n\n**Outline:**\n- Intro: a moral evaluation of the act of masturbation\n- Part 1: Components to an adequate moral evaluation (add examples of masturbation?)\n\t- MICRO Part: what we do\n\t\t- Components of a moral act\n\t\t\t- Knowledge\n\t\t\t\t- definition: consciousness, awareness of your act\n\t\t\t\t- the less I know, the less free I am, and vice versa\n\t\t\t- Freedom \n\t\t\t\t- definition: the ability and responsibility¬†to direct our lives in accordance with¬†our meaning and purpose (according to God's will)\n\t\t\t\t- exercised on 2 levels:\n\t\t\t\t\t- categorical: doing good and avoiding evil \n\t\t\t\t\t- transcendental: becoming conformed to the image of God in whom I was created \n\t\t\t\t- the more free I am in acting, the more responsible I am for my acts, and vice versa\n\t\t\t\t- How is freedom is related to virtues?\n\t\t\t\t\t- Virtues are good stable habits; they're developed from particular acts being repeated over time\n\t\t\t\t\t- We exercise our freedom in order to develop these virtues/good habits\n\t\t\t\t\t- Virtues make doing good easier\n\t\t\t- Matter\n\t\t\t\t- Objective\n\t\t\t\t- The gravity of an act: How much has it affected people?

And the elder answered, From the ancestors, from the land, from the time of creation.\" This piece of dialogue best encapsulates my appreciation of the film because it showed me the motivation behind the Ati tribe advocating for their rights; it's because they're humble enough to admit that their ancestral lands and cultural heritage are the foundations of their knowledge. Thus, they work in protecting these in their own ways:  legally fighting for their land rights, teaching Ati children in school, upholding local traditions. However, the tribe is seen as the [Other](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Other_(philosophy)#Imperialism_and_colonialism) by their fellow citizens and government: they get made fun for their looks, they're considered unsightly for tourists, and they're seen as difficult to hire (because of factors like lacking social skills, inadequate education). Even if there've been some outside efforts that have helped the tribe, like [President Duterte distiributing a portion of Boracay to them](https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/11/08/18/duterte-distributes-land-to-ati-tribe-in-boracay), I can't help but feel that it's all optics; if the President truly cared about their rights, why does this not apply to other IPs like the Lumads? Thankfully, this film is different. Even if the director is also an outsider (being Illongo), he spotlighted many voices, from the marginalized tribe members to their gracious supporters. He recognized that he had a lot to learn from them (instead of the other way around), saying: [\"We will always be humbled by the experience this Ati village in Boracay gave us.\"](https://www.facebook.com/1935087663246115/posts/direk-kevin-piamonte-visits-the-ati-village-in-boracay-as-part-of-his-christmas-/2733024816785725/) I think we, the audience, can also be humbled by this film because many of us take our surroundings for granted. What if we treated nature and culture as treasured gifts, instead of things we can simply consume for our own benefit?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the film *Filipinos Retreat from Trenches* (1899), the gesture that best encapsulated my appreciation of it was Filipino soldiers making their last stand in the pits. This moment struck me because of how hopeful it seemed in the midst of dark times; despite knowing that they were essentially walking into a suicide mission ([since the Americans had an insurmountable military advantage over them](https://www.thoughtco.com/philippine-american-war-4846100)), they wholeheartedly committed to it. This can be seen in their wearing of white uniforms that \ncontrast with their dark surroundings, along with defending their territory with \"great stubbornness\", as the film's description states. This film has a depressing ending that reflects a depressing reality: we are still victims of imperialism, and our conquerors get to define history (this can be seen in how this film was produced by an American company, and [how so many Filipinos grow up glorifying the West](https://www.reddit.com/r/Filipino/comments/hvi5lc/why_do_filipino_worship_whitewestern_culture_so/)). I believe this film also shows \"[Filipino resilience](https://www.scmp.com/yp/report/latest-reports/article/3123941/opinion-resilience-natural-characteristic-philippines-or)\": how Filipinos can consantly pick themselves up in times of disaster.  I personally don't like how glorified this trait is because it exempts higher powers from taking  accountability (i.e. our government, imperialist countries), but I also see how many people can draw inspiration from it. If we were able to get through centuries of colonization, perhaps we can make it through the dismal future that lies ahead of us, like a looming recession and a oligarch-controlled government.\n\n\n![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20220621215149.png]]\n\n\n### Task 2\n-   With the films in this module as pretext, think about how they relate to the concept of¬†**imagination**¬†(whether collective or individual).\n-   Drawing from your background or experience, if you have any related or tangential insights, please feel free to share as well.\n\n\nHow do both of these films relate to the concept of imagination? Despite their differences, they're both about Filipinos fighting for a dream future ‚Äî one where they are truly free. This is a future they have to imagine because they haven't experienced freedom in so long, thanks to decades of foreign powers taking over what they truly own. Even if they don't know what it's like to be free, they still know that it's their right. This is what motivates them to make their imagination a reality. \n\nRelated to this insight, I realized recently that my dream future is collective liberation: a radical future that's free of oppressive systems, and everyone gets to be treated with dignity and respect. This got me way more interested in critical theory! I'm quite the polymath, so I'm motivated to work towards this future in various ways, whether it's as an educator or a technologist.\n\n![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20220622001519.png]]\n![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20220622001538.png]]","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.727605418Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2022-06-22":{"title":"2022-06-22","content":"## Filipino Film and Society\n#society #Filipino #culture #media \n- **epistemic violence:** how knowledge is created, circulated....\n\t- Why do they need to go to a school?

This was accelerated by the pandemic, which forced everyone to collaborate online; despite all the benefits of remote work, [people missed each other](https://news.microsoft.com/innovation-stories/mesh-for-microsoft-teams/): remote meetings are impersonal, lacking the small real-life moments that colleagues cherished. Through mixed reality applications, Mesh brings this desired presence back into the virtual space.\n\nIf this device was successfully and widely adopted, it could help creates a future where we fully live in the [Metaverse](https://www.gather.town/post/why-the-metaverse-matters). Before, our locations would dictate our lives: work, education, love, etc. Now, we spend most of our lives on the Internet, interacting with users all over the globe. Imagine how much our online experiences could be transformed by presence. The Metaverse would create not only meaningful human connection, but also unprecedented access to opportunity. \n\nFor instance, McKinsey states that [industries with the highest physical proximity are likely to be most disrupted](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/future-of-work/the-future-of-work-after-covid-19): healthcare, retail, education, etc. Opportunity would become more accessible for both customers and employees; the former could acquire world-renowned expertise while the latter could work abroad ‚Äî all without leaving their homes. This would especially benefit those from developing countries, like the Philippines. For example, the web3 space is full of infinite learning opportunities, like attending workshops and contributing to projects. However, I struggle to make the most out of these because the space is very Eurocentric. It's difficult to network and collaborate with others because of my timezone and passport; even worse, the way I present myself online is limited to my avatar or video. Mesh would help me fully connect with others by making me more \"real\" to them.\n\nHowever, despite all the benefits Mesh has to offer, I also worry that it could bring about a dystopian Metaverse: one that dehumanizes its users. Across various VR platforms, there've already been many incidents of degrading behavior, such as [racist insults](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/20/cto-racism-could-ruin-metaverse-if-tech-doesnt-improve-diversity-now.html) and [sexual harassment](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/12/16/1042516/the-metaverse-has-a-groping-problem/). Mesh's features can be unintentionally used for these nefarious purposes. A dystopian world  is also oppressive, surveilling their citizens through [corporate and technological control](https://libraryguides.mdc.edu/c.php?g=957851\u0026p=6914808). A [monopolized Metaverse](https://reboothq.substack.com/p/metaverse) can exemplify this; Anthony Tan describes this as \"...a privatized, financially maximizing reality...where humans...are harvested for data, status, and money.\" Mesh users would not only be giving Microsoft ‚Äî a Big Tech corporation ‚Äî money, but also all their behavioral data. How else can the device generate a lifelike photorealistic projection? And how can we be sure that this device won't record our experience while using it? Microsoft would end up upholding what Shoshana Zuboff calls [surveillance capitalism](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/24/opinion/sunday/surveillance-capitalism.html): a business model that endangers our privacy and democracy.\n\nOverall, Mesh can only be ready for adoption if it is heavily evaluated by experts; otherwise, instead of circumventing inequalities, it would elevate them.\n\n\nThe Internet helped us expand beyond our local networks, connecting us with people all over the world; the Metaverse could build on this by enabling us to deeply engage with others, no matter the distance. \n\nThe lack of resources pushes Filipinos to study/work overseas, a costly process only a few can afford. \n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/future-of-work/the-future-of-work-after-covid-19\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.727605418Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2022-06-27":{"title":"2022-06-27","content":"## Cultural Studies of Technology\n#technology #culturalstudies \n### Critical Theory and Cultural Studies\n#### Theory VS Law\n- A **law** is a more solidifed and formal statement, distilled and arrived at from repeated experiemnts\n- **Theories** are not laws because they have not been verified to the same degree, and may not be sufficiently general; theories may lead to the formulation of laws in the long run, eventually\n\n#### Marxist Theory\n- **Base:** a combination of the 'forces of production' and the 'relations of production'.\n\t- ==Forces of production:== raw materials, tools, tehcnology, workers, and their skills, etc.\n\t- ==The relations of production:== class relations of those engaged in production.\n\t- Each mode of production produces its own particular relations of production. One's class positon is determined by one's relationship to the mode of production.\n\t\t- E.G. capitalist mode: bourgeois/proletariat relations\n- **Superstructure:** ==institutions== (political, legal, educational, cultural, etc.) and =='definite forms of social consciousness'== generalized by these which arise on the basis of the mode of production (economic base)\n- Systems of infrastructure\n\n#### Ideology and Mass Media\n- In Marxism, an **ideology** is a ==false set of ideas perpetuated by the dominant political class==\n- According to this stance, the mass media functions to produce =='false consciousness'==\n- This leads to an ==extreme stance== whereby media products are seen aas to be monolithic expressions of ruling class values\n\n#### Marxist Keywords and Concepts\n- socio-economic approach\n- emphasis on class struggle\n- ideology and 'false consciousness'\n\n#### Marxism and Conflict Theory\n*from the video recommendations*\n\n- Marx is concerned with ==freedom==. He asked: \"How can people be free?\" Because humans aren't naturally free; we're actually very constrained.\n- **Labor:** the work we put in to survive in our world (by changing it)\n\t- We must labor cooperatively in order to survive\n- We may have freed ourselves from natural constraints (i.e. physical bodies), we entangled ourselves in new ==social constraints== (i.e. inequal power structures)\n- Thus, Marxism is concerned with labor: how it's organized, who benefits, how it changes over time\n- **Historical Materialism:** looks at ==change over time== + concerned w/ questions of ==material reality==: production and control of resources\n\t- In order to understand things like politics and religion, you need to understand that material reality they were based on first\n- Base and superstructure\n- Marx saw historical development in terms of ==modes of production== and ==economic classes==\n\t- modes of production: stags of history\n- **Industrial capitalism**\n\t- working class (proletariat) v.s. capitalists (bourgeoise)\n\t- difference in control over means of production -\u003e exploitation in capitalism in the form of ==wage labor==\n\t- difference between value of wage \u0026 value of what's produced -\u003e source of ==surplus== in capitalism\n\t- 1 big problem: crises...specifically, ==crises of production==...for the first itme in history, there are crises of having too much\n\t\t- advances always stall, because forces of production will always run up against the limits created by the relations of production\n\t\t\t- limiting factories, technology, human labor\n\t\t- capitalists drove down wages in pursuit of profit, and they competed with each other, leading to a lack of coordination in the economy\n\t\t\t- Wound up with a population that couldn't afford to buy anything, but at the same time were offered more goods than they could ever need\n\t\t- In short: ==relations of production that created economic growth became precisely the things that causes crises==\n- How can society move past this impasse? According to Marx, the way forward was ==class conflict==\n\t- history is a matter of struggling classes, he said, each aligned with either the forces (proletariat) or relations of production (bourgeois)\n\t- bourgeois like the status quo (because profit), while the proletariat want change... a ==revolution==\n\t\t- further development in forces of production; complete change in relations of production\n\t\t- end to exploitation, they want the surplus to benefit them, since their labor created the surplus...\n- How do the bourgeoise manage to stay in power so effectively? According to Gramsci, it's through ==hegemonic culture or hegemony==: a dominant set of ideas that are all-pervasive and taken for granted in society\n\t- don't need to be economic ideas; can also be beliefs about gender or race\n- Marx's biggest impact -\u003e even though it's specific to economic conflict, we can see it in the essence of the broader sociological paradigm of ==conflict theory==: the basic idea of looking at power dynamics and analyzing the ways in which struggles over power drive social change\n\t- as all kinds of groups, not just workers and owners, fight for control over resources\n- Marx's ideas gave rise to tons of conflict theories in sociology. These theories give us ways to understand power, control, and freedom in society\n\t- Race-Conflict Theory\n\t- Gender-Conflict Theory\n\t- Intersectional Theory\n\n#### Structuralism\n##### Semiotics\n- Words make the world intelligible by differentiating between concepts\n- Language is what creates differentation\n\t- E.G. 'baka' in English and Japanese\n- Comes with...\n\t- Signifier\n\t- Signified\n\t- Sign\n\t- Code\n\n![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20220627142950.png]]\n\n- Basic premise: all forms of communication can be broken down into ==individual units of meaning,== which may then be studied in terms of their singular characteristics\n- Units of meaning are understood in terms of how they interact with other units of meaning\n\n###### Semiotics and Structuralism\n- Structuralism stresses that ==each element within a cultural system derives it meaning from its relationship to every other element==\n- There are no independent meanings, but rather many meanings produced by their difference from other elements in the system\n\n##### Keywords/Summary\n**Signs**\n\nSigns are said to be formed by the¬†**signifier**¬†and the¬†**signified**. The signifier, in general, is what we perceive and experience, while the signified is the meaning the the signifier pertains to. In this arrangement, the signifier¬†_points to_¬†the signified. It must be noted, additionally, that we make sense of the world through the use of signs, and that signs get their meaning through differentiation with other signs in the same system. In this way, we also say that the relationship between sign and meaning is arbitrary rather than fixed, given, or immutable.\n\n**Code**\nCodes refer to conventions that govern sign systems, which may range from the very strict and precise to the informal and vague.\n\n**Myth**\n\nRoland Barthes introduces the idea of mythologies or myth-making, which he describes beginning with¬†**denotation**¬†and¬†**connotation**.\n\nDenotation refers to¬†primary signification¬†or¬†_surface meaning_. Connotation, meanwhile, refers to¬†secondary signification. Barthes argues that it is at the level of secondary signification that myth is made for consumption. More importantly, mythology deals with the production of¬†**ideology**, wherein it is understood as a body of ideas and practices which defend the prevailing structure of power by actively promoting the values and interests of dominant groups in society.\n\nThis makes way to give historical intention a natural justification.\n\n#### Codes\n- Conventions (rules) governing sign systems\n- May be precise, such as grammatical rules that govern language or vague/changeable, delimited by history and context\n- Link signs together in ways that reflect a particular interpretation of a community's system of values, myths, and ideologies\n\n#### Myths\n##### Ronald Barthes: Mythologies\n- adds: denotation and conotation\n- at the level of secondary signification or conotation, myth is made for consumption\n\n##### General\n- mythic signs reinforce dominant values\n- ideological signs enlist support for the status quo by transforming history into nature; pretending the current conditions are, and always have been, the natural order of things\n- deals with the production of ideology\n- **\"Ideology\"** is understood as a ==body of ideas and practices which defend the prevailing structure of power== by actively promoting the values/interest of dominant groups in society\n- gives historical intention\n\n\n#### Critical Theory\n- An **ethically heightened** and **politically reflective** study of the relationships between **power, knowledge,** and **discourse** that are produced in contexts of **historical** and **cultural struggle.**\n\t- takes inspiration from Marxism and structuralism\n- All thought is fundamentally mediated by power relations that are socially/historically constituted\n- The relation between concept and object between signifier and signified is never stable or fixed and is oftern mediated by social relations of capitalist production and consumption\n- Scrutinizes the role of cultural institutions in the production of ideological discourse\n\n#### ISA and Hegemony\n- ISA: Ideological state appratuses\n- \"[C]ultural members ==make choices in the context of a life-world whose options for meaning have always already been shaped by ideology.== They experience themselves as exercising agency in making choices and sometimes even as resisting cultural authority.\"\n- \"They are not aware, however, of the ==options that have been rendered literally unthinkable by dominant ideologies== ‚Äî moved beyond the rim of the conceivable or legitimate.\"\n\n#### Towards Critical Theory\n- **Marxist:** ==socio-economic approach== (base/superstructure, class struggle, ideology)\n- **Semiotics:** ==structural approach== (the study of signs, codes, and the production of myths)\n- **Critical theory:** concerned with the ==production of ideology== (knowledge, power, and discourse, within the context of struggle)\n\n#### Postmodern Critical Theory\n- Disintegration of colonial systems\n- Advent of the information age\n- Globalization\n- Dismantling/reassembling of cultures\n- Loss of faith in \"foundational\" metanarratives\n- Instability of identities\n\n#### Cultural Studies\n- **Cultural economy:** the blending of the traditional meanings of text and commodity\n- Exploring the relationship between an ==object's *official* value== and its ==unofficial potential for generating meaning and supporting beliefs==\n- Culture is seen as the ==site of struggle==\n- Power/knowledge are discursively produced\n\n[**AlphaGo Documentary**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXuK6gekU1Y)\n[**Karl Marx and Conflict Theory**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR3igiwaeyc)\n\n\u003e Grounded in what we have learned from Marxist theory, we reiterate the idea that digital technology functions as a¬†system of infrastructure¬†that contributes to the economic base. In this way, it makes possible the becoming of new forms of organization, relationships, and experiences. What this means for our project of examining culture and technology, practically, is that ==any valuation of cultural production must be reconciled with the currently existing material reality it is emerging from.== In other words, any worthwhile investigation of the creation and consumption of content, the use and deployment of technologies, and more importantly their impact on societal beliefs and values, must all be ==contextualized as part of the web spun by economic activity and its resultant power structures.==\n\n\n[**Noah Chomsky - The 5 Filters of the Mass Media Machine**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34LGPIXvU5M)\n- How is consent manufactured according to what you have just watched?\n- What argument does it make with regards to the concept of \"press freedom\" in what is believed to be a democratic society?\n- In what way does the production of goods and the production of content interact with one another to realize the prevailing status quo?\n\n[**Ms. Male Character - Tropes vs Women in Video Games**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYqYLfm1rWA)\n- What signs communicate ideas such as female, femininity, of girlhood? \n- How do these differ from signs that communicate the male gender?

What have people said about this film?\n-   What do we think of the film? How has it affected us?\n\nOne piece of dialogue that best encapsulates my appreciation of Anak Dalita (1956) is \"What we shall test is your resolve amidst our poverty.\" This is because I see it as a reflection of Filipino resilience: the strength that keeps us going in times of distress. This can be seen in so much aspects of the film, like its narratives and conditions. \n\nFirst, the characters. The protagonists featured here are Vic, a disabled veteran who sculpts, and Tita, a prostitute caring for her brother. Both of them were social outcasts struggling with money, which forced them to work in unfavorable conditions, like smuggling money and dancing in clubs. But they stayed strong for the sake of love, whether it be for their family or for each other. Love has always been a driving motivator for Filipinos, especially because of a culture that values close ties so much. Next, the environment. Both of these characters were trying to survive in the slums of a materialistic post-war Manila. It could be also said that the film's workers were doing the same thing; working in the post-war Filipino industry (still reeling from the effects of Japan's occupation and the Cold War), they were trying to make the most out of considerable budgetary limitations. It seemed like everyone had to be resilient for this film, from the characters to the film workers. \n\nPerhaps this was an intentional choice of director Lamberto Avellana, whose style is realism. This was atypical of Filipino films at the same time. Unlike most directors, Avellana didn't resort to major box-office names and singing/dancing performances. Instead, he'd go all-in on realism: casting minor box-office actors, choosing poverty and crime a sa theme, filming in people's houses, etc. This stark deviation from the norm is probably what led the movie to fail in the box office. However, it got critical acclaim: it was chosen as the Philippine entry in the Oscars, and won the Golden Harvest for Best Film Award at the Asia-Pacific Film Festival. So maybe resilience does pay off in the end.\n\nWhat's my personal take? To be honest, I'm iffy with Filipino resilience because it has a problematic nature ‚Äî it takes accountability away from our government, the main entity responsible for taking care of its citizens in times of distress. It also dehumanizes the victims of these situations. However, I didn't feel disgusted watching Anak Dalita, even if it can technically be considered \"poverty porn\". It ended up touching me instead. I think it was because the film allowed me to really get to know the characters. I could empathize with them because they felt so real to me ‚Äî to the point that they felt like real human beings. If they could push through their ordeals, then maybe I could too. This kind of connection is the magic of film at work.\n\n\n\n\nOne piece of dialogue that best encapsulates my appreciation of Jaclyn Jose's performance was this line from her interview: \"Pero pinakatumatak siya sa kanyang signature acting: ang underacting, o yung parang bang, hindi umaarte.\" She brought this style to all her roles, but this can especially be seen in her role as Ma' Rosa: a mother and sari-sari owner who has to sell illegal drugs to make ends meet. In the film, she gets arrested by the police, and her children have to bail her out. I'm sure that there are many  poverty-stricken Filipinos who can relate to this experience (committing crimes just to survive), especially in an administration infamous for its anti-drug agenda and EJKs. Director Brillante Mendoza would often portray urban poor experiences like this, like joining a syndicate or taking care of adopted children. His films would often be win local and international awards, such as Cannes. I think his films are always critically acclaimed because of how...natural they are. He's able to not only reflect the harsh reality of many Filipino lives; he's also able to tell stories that universally resonate, as seen with Jaclyn Jose's natural portrayal of Ma'Rosa, a mother who'd do anything for her kids. Personally, what I take away from all of this is that we are our most successful when we're truly authentic. Connection is only possible when we're fully ourselves. \n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamberto_V._Avellana\nhttps://www.philstar.com/business/2015/12/29/1537407/through-young-eyes-philippines-and-east-asia-1956\n\n\n\n### Connect\n-   With the films in this module as pretext, think about how they relate to the concept of¬†**place**.\n-   Drawing from your background or experience, if you have any related or tangential insights, please feel free to share as well.\n\nHow do both of these films relate to the concept of place? They're both situated in the slums of Manila, and centered around people who live there. They all have to resort to dirty work (e.g. prostitution, money laundering, selling drugs) just so they remain financially capable of staying there. They're willing to put in so much effort for these poverty-stricken places because it's their only home. Despite their low status, these \"...slum inhabitants are crucial to the production of the city space, even as they are rendered invisible by those who own and control the formal means of producing space\" (Macapagal, 2021). The developed cities many of us live in wouldn't be where they are today without the invisible labor of the poor. They are our family caretakers, sari-sari store owners, construction workers, and more. But we often take them for granted because we've gotten so used to their presence, to the point that they're hidden to us. That's why I appreciate slum chronotype films like Anak Dalita and Ma'Rosa; they humanize the marginalized by spotlighting their stories, helping us empathize with them.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.727605418Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2022-07-01":{"title":"2022-07-01","content":"## Cultural Studies of Technology\n#technology #culturalstudies \n### Identities in Cyberculture\n#### Identity Crisis \n- **Old notion of identity:**\n\t- unified\n\t- stable\n\t- centered\n\t- an essential self\n- E.G. middle-class, Asian, heterosexual, male\n- **Postmodern notion of identity:** \n\t- Process, multiplicity, construction\n\t- Made, mobile, multiplex\n- **Contemporary phenomena:**\n\t- Globalization, disembedding, detraditionalization\n- E.g. class mobility, migrants, digital identities\n\n#### Body/Identity and Cyberculture\n- contradicting schools of thought\n- either \"we type ourselves into being in cyberspace,\" thus allowing us to \"remake who we are endlessly, liberated from the 'meat' of our RL bodies and [its] identity-markers[.]\n- Or, \"it restates difference...as it feshitizes it[.]\"\n\n#### Axes of Identity in Focus\n- Race\n- Gender\n- Sexuality\n- Class\n\n##### Race in Cyberculture\n- The assumption of a homogenous, unified set of characteristics and experiences\n- Does race matter in cyberspace?

In giving rise to existence, temporalization worlds a world. Gayatri Spivak introduced the term to postcolonial theory as shorthand to describe how European imperialist cultural representations constructed the geography of colonies. These processes of imperialist discursive cartography, which include canonical literature, are ==a form of epistemic violence that shapes how colonized subjects see themselves.== These processes continue to play a role in the \"worlding\" of the Third World and its native inhabitatns after decolonization.\n\u003e \n\u003e - Pheng Cheah\n\n\u003e ==Cartography reduces the world to a spatial object.== In contradisctinction, worlding is a force that subtends and exceeds all human calculations that reduce the world as a temporal structure ot the sum of objects in space. Imperialist cartography is ==a calculation in the sphere of geopolitical economy== that objectifies the world as a temporal process...Processes of discursive construction are worldings in a derived sense. They imbue the objective world with value and significance. But they are also processes of unworlding because by reducing the world to something spatial, they obscure it worldliness.\n\u003e \n\u003e - Pheng Cheah\n\n\u003e In seeking spatial justice in these visual narratives, ==emancipatory potentials can be gleaned from strategies that attempt to reveal and/or suppress modes of domination and repression== through their use of space in the time of narrative unfolding. From the perspective of this socio-spatial dialectic, slum films can be more productively evaluated in terms of the ways they are able to use space towards instances of emancipatory politics.\n\u003e \n\u003e - Katrina Macapagal\n\n\u003e Even if the ideological closure of the film narratives may at first glance be taken to mean the absolute absence of hope, this does not mean the films do not reveal moments where the ==social agents enact desires toward justice== configured by the slum chronotype.\n\u003e \n\u003e - Katrina Macapagal","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.727605418Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2022-07-05":{"title":"2022-07-05","content":"## Filipino Film and Society\n\u003e \"The cinematic organization of attention yields a situation in which attention, in all forms imaginable and yet to be imagined (from assembly-line work to spectatorship to internet-working and beyond), is that necessary cybernetic relation to the *socius*‚Äîthe totality of the social‚Äîfor the production of value of for late capital\"\n\nReading this line reminded me of one of my favorite books, *How to Do Nothing*, which is what first introduced me to the attention economy. Learning of this concept made me realize how intentional I should be with my consumption. In this hyperdigital world full of distractions, attention is a scarce resource; I want to pay attention to people that matter to me (e.g. close relationships), not corporations who want to profit from my engagement.\n\n### Observe\n\n![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20220705150803.png]]\n![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20220705150858.png]]\n\n\nThese are the two moments that stood out to me in both of these films. The first shot from *Temptation Island (1980)* depicts the beauty pageant finalists dancing after acknowledging their dire circumstances (i.e. stranded in an island with no food, water, and shelter). The second shot from *Marcos Fiesta 2013 Flash Mob Full (2013)* depicts a rave-like celebration, with actors representing the Marcoses watching on-stage. I find them both similar in the sense that performance is used to distract from reality's problems, whether it be the danger of dying or historical revisionism.\n\n### Reflect\n#### Temptation Island\n_\"What are bitches for but to bitch around with her fellow bitches?\"_\n\nCampy. Sensual. Funny. These are all the traits that define director Joey Gosiengfao's films. His masterpiece, *Temptation Island (1980)*, exemplifies all of these, and they can be best seen in this single line. Centered around four catty beauty pageant finalists, the whole film can essentially be summarized as \"bitches bitching with fellow bitches\", and I had good fun watching it all. Hair-pulling catfights, evident queerness, unexpected cannibalism ‚Äî it's impressive how Gosiengfao was able to pack all of these into one film. He truly was ahead of his time.\n\nSeriously, he was. I almost can't believe that this film was made in the 70s, during Marcos Sr.'s regime. This time was known as the Second Golden Age of Philippine Cinema; even if Martial Law brought about censorship and regulation, a generation of avant-garde filmmakers came into the spotlight, making films that presented the state of the human condition, and the ills of Filipino society (CNN Philippines Life Staff, 2016). These dark circumstances were probably a factor in why Gosiengfao never gained an award for his work. Getting recognized in the film industry requires playing with compromise and politics; winners required righteousness and respectability, everything Gosiengfao's films were not (Vera, 2007). \n\nBut I believe his controversial style of filmmaking enabled him to be truly authentic.  Beneath all its spectacle, Temptation Island (1980) was able to comment on \nAngel Britanico (2011) writes: \"Despite maintaining a front of comedy and shallowness,¬†Gosiengfiao‚Äôs material¬†dips¬†into the best and worst aspects of human nature, probing what makes people savage and what makes them human.\" This multi-layered nature is what makes his films cult classics, resonating with viewers even decades from now. I believe his spirit still lives on, as seen in the popularity of teleseryes and Drag Race. Why do we still like seeing \"bitching\"? Perhaps because it reveals so much about ourselves.\n\n\n#### Marcos Fiesta\n![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20220705152537.png]]\n\n\n\nWhat struck me most from this film was seeing these two actors happily dance together. On first glance, this looks like a vintage depiction of a wholesome romance. However, it gets dark when you realize that these two actors are portraying Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos ‚Äî the conjugal dictators who ruled the Philippines in 1970s. This performance was part of the Marcos Fiesta, an annual celebration held by the Ilocos Norte LGU to commemorate Ferdinand Marcos Sr.'s legacy. Performers would do balletic dances and melodramatic theatrics based on the lives of the Marcoses, encouraged by a giant flashmob wearing Marcos shirts. This extravagant fiesta is a prime example of how the Marcoses weaponize culture. Through years of investing in art, architecture, literature, and media (e.g. Malakas and Maganda paintings, \"Golden Age\" infrastructure, BBM's family vlogs), they aimed to rewrite their narrative. They not only portrayed themselves as a good-looking, aspirational, national family, but also as \"origins\" of a \"New Society\", which apparently \"...[allowed] them to cross and redraw all boundaries, social, political, and cultural.\" (Buluan, 2021; van Wagtendonk. 2022). \n\nHow exactly did the Marcoses' works sway the public? Angel Martinez (2022) explored this by exposing a new Tiktok account to a pro-BBM algorithm; I believe the following traits can apply to their other works as well, especially the Marcos Fiesta. First, the family makes use of an \"aww\" factor. They deal with negative press by painting themselves as the victim/underdog (e.g. BBM against mainstream media, Marcos Jr. being \"unfairly\" jailed). Next, they take advantage of the power of fandom. They try to humanize themselves through \"relatable\" portrayals so that the masses can empathize with them (even if they're different social classes). Then, they appeal to emotion. Instead of using complicated infographics and jargon-filled speeches, the Marcoses fight with stories: breaking hearts by talking about living without a father, bringing up nostalgia by recounting the \"Golden Age\", and sparking hope by saying \"We'll make this country great again\" (sounds familiar?). Finally, they have trusted seals of approval. The Marcoses were able to get this far thanks to the combined power of their supporters, from disinformation leaders like celebrities and private advertising agencies to fellow oligarchs such as the Dutertes. By weaponizing culture, the Marcoses were able to put the Filipinos under an \"era of thought control\", both then and now (Mijares, 1976).\n\nSeeing Marcos apologists on all kinds of social media is infuriating, but I also can't help but feel sorry for them. Many of these supporters didn't have enough critical thinking skills or technical literacy to protect themselves from the Marcoses' all-consuming narratives. We, the opposition, have a lot to learn about how this family operates. If we want to still put up a fight for these next 6 years, we need to play the long game, just like our opponents did.\n\n\n### Connect\n- cinematic mode of production\n\t- composed of forces: technology\n\t- and relations: cast and crew\n\t- cinema is the paradigmatic example of how the act of looking has been construed by capital as ‚Äúproductive labor.‚Äù\n\n\nHow are both of these films related to the concept of power? I can't help but think like a Marxist, seeing how much power struggles have influenced their making. For me, these two films both respond to authority ‚Äî the Marcos family ‚Äî in opposite ways: *Temptation Island (1980)* tries to fight against their power, while *Marcos Fiesta (2013)* attempts to sustain it. The films' forces of production are similar; materials, workers, and technology (i.e. props/VFX, actors, cinema) come together to create a visual spectacle. However, their relations of production are vastly different; Gosiengfao and his crew could be considered as part of the proletariat of his time (the director was often snubbed for awards, and many of his actors were just starting out in the scene), while the Marcoses are the epitome of the bourgeois. Overall, both films succeed in extracting the attention of their audience, which enable these films to influence their consciousness. You can either end up pondering on current society or romanticizing a new narrative; this is the power of cinema at work.\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.727605418Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2022-07-06":{"title":"2022-07-06","content":"## Filipino Film and Society\n#culturalstudies #media #society \n### Agency \n#### Marxism\n\u003e Men make their own history, but they do not make it as they please; they do not make it under self-selected circumstances, but ==under circumstances existing already==, given and transmitted from the past.

Thus Luther put on the mask of the Apostle Paul, the Revolution of 1789-1814 draped itself alternately in the guise of the Roman Republic and the Roman Empire, and the Revolution of 1848 knew nothing better to do than to ==parody==, now 1789, now the revolutionary tradition of 1793-95. In like manner, the beginner who has learned a new language always translates it back into his mother tongue, but he assimilates the spirit of the new language and express himself freely in it only when he moves in it without recalling the old...\n\u003e \n\u003e -- Karl Marx\n\n- enacting social change is like learning a new language\n- there's a learning curve, it takes some time before you think in this new world order\n\n#### Three Concepts of Agency\n1. **Private:** Perry Anderson suggests that we can distinguish three ways in which human beings can be said to 'make history', each involving a different sort of goal for their activity. The first and most typical form of historical action is the pursuit of 'private' goals -- =='cultivation of a plot, choice of a marriage, exercise of a skill, maintenance of a home, bestowal of a name'.==\n2. **Public:** The 2nd kind of agency, like the 1st, operates within the framework of existing social relations, pertaining to the kind of ventures involving 'public' goals, for example, =='political struggles, military conflicts, diplomatric transactions, commercial exlorations'==, that are the stuff of conventional narrative history.\n3. **Global collective:** Finally, there is the 'unprecedented form of agency' involved in the collective pursuit of global social transformation, which first appeared in the American and French Revolutions but acquired full expression only with the emergence of the workers' movement and revolutionary Marxism: here, 'for the first time cllective projects of social transformation were ==married to systematic efforts to understand the processes of past and present, to produce a premediated future.=='\n\n#### On Mode of Production\n\u003e The ==specific economic form, in which unpaid surplus-labour is pumped out of direct producers==, determines the relationship of rulers and ruled, as it grows directly out of production itself and, in turn, reacts upon it as a determining element.

She finds whimsical in dire situations. While the late Lino Brocka, and his successors, would've made grave drama about the living conditions of Tondo, Garcia-Molina finds gems of human ingenuity. The rooftop of a squalid apartment becomes filled with colorful tents and bright umbrellas that shield gamblers and afternoon drunkards from the gaze of the sun; two buildings are connected by a string that allows laundry to be brought to and fro; women drag their children like a hen dragging her set of chicks. It is that unexplainable cosmos of survivors and their survival techniques that the Americans (in this case, Will) would never understand; and that's what Garcia-Molina forwards so wonderfully.\n\t\t- That run-of-the-mill ending of all romantic comedies wherein the male lover chases after his female lover (or vice versa) which is always against time, circumstance, or calamity is pumped up by Garcia-Molina and her team of imaginative writers, made distinctly Filipino by an adherence to exaggeration and over-the-top histrionics. This time, it works mostly because Garcia-Molina has consistently made it work ever since the first scene where time-tied Sally hilariously un-knots a traffic jam to the real, from ridiculous and enjoyable party-poverty in Tondo to the half-buried yet still habitable houses of Pampanga. It's a string of fascinating sequences and all of them are genuinely enjoyable. I do not kid.\n\t\t- \"I am directing because I want to tell stories. And who are the stories for?

Broken, oo. Pero hindi missing.\"\n\nIn this scene, Will tries to excuse his behavior towards Sam, believing that he lacks a heart because of abandonment issues. Sam tells him otherwise, and berates him for not even trying to care (whether it‚Äôs looking for his birth parents or respecting Sam‚Äôs feelings). This line of dialogue struck me the most because of the message it sends: no matter what‚Äôs happened to us, we still have hearts ‚Äî and it‚Äôs up to us to make the most out of them. I also see this connected to Filipino culture. Despite centuries of colonization, there is still an essence that is truly Filipino; it just needs to be brought out. And this can be done through art that showcases a truly Filipino identity, such as *You Are the One (2006)*. \n\nIn fact, I'd consider this film an example of what scholar Elvin Valerio (n.d.) calls \"a truly Filipino alternative cinema\". But how does this qualify for such After all, this film is the epitome of commercial; as a romantic-comedy produced and distributed by industry giant Star Cinemas, it ascribes to the same traditional formula: big stars, crowd-pleasing tales, happy endings. According to Valerio, alternative cinema must act as an instrument of decolonization. One way this can be done is going against oppressive formalist standards that are often defined by the West. Traits that film critics see as inferior (e.g. scene-oriented narratives, overt representation, circumlocutory dialogue, and emphasis on the main star) must be fully embraced by local filmmakers. Valerio suggests that alternative filmmakers can make use of popular movie genres; then, they can reinvent its traditional narrative modes with subtle hints of globalization and neo-imperialism. This approach ensures the development of a critical consciousness without alienating Filipino audiences. Overall, the objective of alternative cinema is not simply to entertain ‚Äî it must strive to \"Filipinize\" the Filipino masses .\n\nThis is exactly what director Cathy Garcia-Molina does with her films; she breathes new life into formulaic plots by giving them a distinctly Filipino twist. According to critic Oggs Cruz (2007), this is because she's able to find the whimsical in dire situations. For example: by making use of exaggeration and over-the-top histrionics, she's able to show how *pakikisama* transforms dim places into lively communities (e.g. the sterile NSA office, the dirty slums of Tondo, the ash-filled environment of Pampanga). At the same time, she's also capable of social commentary, specifically American culture and its influence on Filipino colonial mentality; this is shown through the characters of Sam and Will. They both have family ties to the United States: Sam's family is pursuing the \"American Dream\", while Will is part of the Fil-Am disapora. However, their different backgrounds cause them to clash in terms of communcation. An example of this is low context expression of American culture versus high context expression of Filipino culture; the former relies on verbal and direct communication, while the latter relies on using non-verbal cues, dropping hints,  and using humor/euphemism (Samuels, 2020).  Thus, whenever Sam is mad, Will struggles to understand her because she is never direct with him. \n\nIn the end, it could be said that both protagonists now have a greater understanding of not just themselves, but also what it means to be Filipino. This is not only seen in their explorations of Tondo and Pampanga, but also in the strengthening of their close ties. I'm sure that their experience resonated with a lot of Filipinos; I believe that Garcia-Molina's films are constant box office successes because the stories she tells hit close to home. What she values the most isn't rave reviews or high earnings, but the reception of her audience; for her, hearing that her films help bring comfort and relief to people is priceless (Gonzalez, 2021). This is why I consider her films as \"alternative cinema\". This cinema serves the Filipino masses by making them its true subject (Valerio, 2020). For Garcia-Molina, service is spotlighting Filipino hearts on the big screen.\n\n\n\nhttps://www.philstar.com/entertainment/2006/09/04/356279/film-review-you-are-one-feel-good-romantic-joy-ride\nhttps://oggsmoggs.blogspot.com/2007/06/you-are-one-2006.html\nhttps://kalamansijuice.com/american-versus-filipino-expression/\nhttps://www.screendaily.com/local-filipino-films-see-40-box-office-surge/4031549.article\nhttps://www.academia.edu/34467492/The_Other_Other_Cinema_National_and_Cultural_Identity_in_Filipino_Alternative_Films\nhttps://metro.style/people/society-personalities/fascinating-women-cathy-garcia-molina/24241\n\n![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20220711135828.png]]\n\n- what happened?\n\t- the critic played by John Arcilla questions the church photographer played by Ronnie Lazaro\n\t\t- tells him no one will pay him for his job\n\t\t- calling him an opportunist for stealing people's smiles\n\t\t- self-reflection: how much are you willing to sacrifice just to make a living doing what you love?\n\t\t- says the real people are outside (those inside the church are hypocrites daw)\n\t\t\t- bad people outside?\n\t- anino: shadows\n\t- Shows external circumstances affect our life perspective\n- millieu\n\t- early 2000s\n\t\t- political turmoil (Estrada admin)\n\t- poverty, class inequality still prevalent\n- direction/production\n\t- Raymond Red\n\t\t- pioneer figures of modern Filipino alternative cinema\n\t\t- background in visual arts and photography -\u003e experimental and narrative super-8mm and 16mm short films\n\t\t- An enfant terrible ‚Äî every movie industry needs one.

The critic speaks cruelly: he tells the photographer that no one will pay him for his job, he calls him an opportunist, and he says that he is wasting his life. According to him, real people aren't found in the church; instead, they're found outside, in the streets of Manila. This drives away the photographer, who ends up running into more fortunes ‚Äî such as having his camera stolen and getting arrested after a fight. \n\nI appreciate this line of dialogue because it encapsulates how dehumanizing living in Manila (and by extension, the Philippines) can be, especially when you're from an unprivileged background (i.e. poor photographer from the province). The protagonist of this film is treated as less than a person. Aside from being nameless, he is also constantly having something taken away from him. The critic questions his philosophy. The child steals his camera. The driver and the police destroy his dignity (and possibly his life). Thanks to these people, everything he once had is now gone.\n\nWhy are these absurd characters considered \"real\", while these devout churchgoers are not? Perhaps it's because of cynicism. It could be argued that these characters were being authentic to themselves, while the churchgoers are hypocritical. According to the critic, they believe themselves to be powerful, when in reality they're being used by higher forces to inflict harm on others. I saw this as a commentary of how classism is embedded in the Filipino religious experience. This is not only seen in our present (e.g. extravagant consumerism during Christmas, religious universities seen as elitist institituions), but also in our past (e.g. Spanish friars abusing positions of power). After all, if Christ‚Äôs gospel advocates for love, compassion, justice and peace, why does this predominantly Catholic society tolerate the shockingly inhuman conditions of the masses (Carvajal, 2020)?\n\n *Anino (2000)* is depressing, but it's a brilliant reflection of society's inequality. This was the objective of director Raymond Red. As one of the pioneers of modern Filipino alternative cinema, he played a role in the Third Golden Age of Philippine cinema: an era defined by independent flmmakers who weren't afraid to show serious societal issues (Dorsch, 2022). Multiple factors influenced this development: the rise of the digital medium, high taxes on films, local political turmoil (Labrador, 2001; Dorsch, 2022). Despite the dire circumstances, Red was relentlessly dedicated to his craft; he even said: \"I don't make films to be liked...I make them to capture reality. Some won't like the vision.\" (Palanca, 2000). Unfortunately, this devotion was costly. Even if his work received critical acclaim, many didn't like his vision (e.g. big studios and local critics), and he almost went bankrupt making *Anino*. He eventually had to resort to freelance commercial work in order to fuel his artistic pursuits.\n\nI believe Red was able to depict dehumanization so well because of his personal experience with it. Perhaps he saw himself in the broke photographer. I wonder if he also struggled with the same criticism. How does he feel balancing TV commercials and indie films? Does he think he's an opportunist for creating films on societal issues? Is he now a complete cynic, or does he still have hope for his industry and society? This film may be two decades old, but I'm sure that these struggles are still relevant today.\n\n\n\n\nSources:\nhttps://reelrundown.com/film-industry/filipino-movies\nhttps://talaarawan.org/anino-poverty-social-injustice-and-self-critic-film-ideology-essay/\nhttps://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/as.2001.41.1.221\nhttp://edition.cnn.com/ASIANOW/asiaweek/features/asiabest2000/pop.shortfilm.html#:~:text=Anino%20won%20the%20Palme%20d,reality%20of%20present%2Dday%20Manila.\nhttps://ph.news.yahoo.com/carvajal-religious-oligarchs-142300065.html\n\n### Connect\n- desire\n- imagination, social realism\n- Filipino resilience?\n- Desirable Other: Findings revealed that the desire to seek relationships with one another is driven by their desire based on the preconceptions they perceive one another to possess.\n- \"Lumaki akong walang dream\"\n- \"I‚Äôm hoping as I said in my speech--which wasn‚Äôt prepared, I was caught completely off guard--that this would be a new sign of hope for all of us.

That this would prove the Filipino filmmaker is as good as any in the world.\"\n\n\nWhat's the relationship between desires and dreams? The former can be seen as temporary self-centered wants, while the latter can be seen as long-term aspirations for something bigger than ourselves. With this definition in mind, it can be said that most Filipinos have desires, but not dreams. Around 8 to 10 Filipinos do not have a dream (Joaquin, 2022); even director Cathy Garcia-Molina admitted, \"Lumaki ako walang dream\" (de los Reyes, 2020). According to Chanco (2022), this is because most Filipinos, being poor, are operating on survival mode. This can be seen in Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs; you're not capable of seeking self-actualization if you're worried about getting to eat everyday. The dreams most Filipinos get to have are often individualistic, extending to at most family and friends (e.g. being a housewife, working and migrating abroad). \n\nThis can be seen in the protagonists of both films. Sam and Will of *You Are the One (2006)* were both quite content with their own lifestyles. Their goals at the time were individualistic in nature, and were imparted to them by their families (e.g. getting a US visa, finding your birth parents). The nameless photographer of *Anino (2000)* has something closer to a dream: making a living doing what he loves. However, his unfortunate circumstances forces him to give up on this for the sake of survival. \nDespite the \"lacking\" scale of their dreams, all of the films' protagonists are gravely affected when they're taken away, becoming shells of their former selves. After running into a disappointing false alarm, Will recedes to his distant playboy behavior. After losing his camera, the photographer seems to lose the will to live. Without dreams, we become less than human.\n\nHow can Filipinos develop the capacity to dream big? According to Joaquin (2022), we'd need the following: encouraging conversations, inspiring role models, an expanded perspective, available opportunities, and abundant resources. And I believe that Philippine cinema can play a key role in capacity-building. Their stories can start discussions and open our minds. The audience can look up to everyone working in the industry, from cast to crew. This space is a great space to grow dreams. Perhaps it could even be the birthplace of a collective national dream or a sense of nationhood ‚Äî both things we lack (Chanco, 2022). For instance, director Raymond Red saw his award as a new sign of hope for all of us Filipinos; he hoped that \"...this would prove the Filipino filmmaker is as good as any in the world.\" (Vera, 2007). And this dream is no longer only his; as seen in the rise of local filmmakers, it is the dram of many Filipinos as well.\n\n\n- https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1482243/FULLTEXT01.pdf\n- https://metro.style/people/society-personalities/fascinating-women-cathy-garcia-molina/24241\n- https://shuklabose.medium.com/the-difference-between-dreams-desire-2c6a76c9a607","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.727605418Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2022-07-13":{"title":"2022-07-13","content":"## Filipino Film and Society\n#Filipino #media #society #culture \n### Dreaming\n\u003e [O]ur reaction reveals as much about ourselves as it does about the movie we react against.

I dont want to make yet another women-led collection anymore\n\n#### Writing\nLast year, I got into the world of Web3. I was excited about the potential of its technologies, especially NFTs. So I did everything to learn more about them, from reading about artists I admired to buying my own NFTs. Web3 is complex and daunting part of what helped me get through the steep learning curve were the various female empowerment initiatives in the space. For instance: Astro Girls, one of the first NFTs I bought, aimed to ‚Äúmake this space accessible to all women by smashing the gender gap and demystifying crypto‚Äú. Now that I'm over my honeymoon phase (thanks bear market), I can't help but question this philosophy. Do these initiatives truly want \"women empowerment\", or are they simply reviving the girlboss rhetoric?\n\nThe girlboss rhetoric is a 2010s trend in which women leaders broke into male-dominated fields, but in a self-serving way (Levitsky \u0026 the Source Code team, 2022). Alex Abad-Santos (2021) states that the girlboss concept is centered around \"the melding of the professional self and identity, capitalist aspiration, and a specific [but limited] version of empowerment\". It's exclusionary feminism, and the futuristic nature of Web3 does nothing to change it. Let's analyze this through the axes of class and race.\n\nWhen we look at Web3's version of women empowerment, we get the sense the space is only for the financially privileged. After all, the faces of this kind of \"empowerment\" are afffulent celebrities. How do they promote this? Instead of advocating for better access to digital infrastructure and digital financial literacy, they promote investing in NFTs (Herdiani, 2022); thus, they define \"empowerment\" as financial success and consumerism. But only the wealthy afford to buy NFTs, which are known for being outrageously expensive. For example, the popular NFT collection World of Women starts at 4.0 ETH (35K - 270K pesos). The team also got backlash from the community when they sold their latest drop through a Dutch auction, which gave an unfair advantage to wealthy collectors (Teoh, 2022). Marginalized women aren't equipped to handle the big costs of investing in such a volatile market. \n\nNFTs not only profit off marginalized women's losses, but also their likeness. World of Women prides itself for \"representation\", which is seen in its diverse range of skin color. But who truly benefits from this? Alice Capelle (2022) likens the dematerializing nature of NFTs to traditional paintings, stating that both treat underrepresented women  as objects for the creators' profit. Creators are free to use their features in their artworks, unlike photoshoots or runway shows, where the models get compensated. The celebrities promoting these NFTs happen to be white too; just look at Reese Witherspoon, Gwyneth Paltrow, Paris Hilton, etc. I believe that these these NFT influencers \u0026 brands aren't  advocating for \"representation\"; in reality, they're redwashing. For them, social justice language is their customer acquisition strategy. \n\nOverall, the empowerment espoused by the \"women in Web3\" movement is performative. Despite presenting itself as progressive, it fails to question existing oppressive power structures.\n\n#### Sources\n- https://youtu.be/kNbrofX06OU\n- https://magdalene.co/story/crypto-queen-or-girlboss-how-the-crypto-hype-empowers-privileged-women\n- https://nftevening.com/world-of-women-galaxy-nft-sold-out-but-not-without-some-hiccups/\n- https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/sourcecode/rip-big-tech-events?rebelltitem=1#rebelltitem1\n- https://www.vox.com/22466574/gaslight-gatekeep-girlboss-meaning\n\n### Short Reaction Paper 5\n#### Outline\n1.

Conclusion: it's all capitalism's fault\n\t\n\n\n#### Writing\nOne of my favorite games of all time is Going Under: \"a satirical dungeon crawler about exploring the cursed ruins of failed tech startups.\" (Aggro Crab, 2020). Here, you play as the unpaid intern Jackie, whose company campus happens to be built on top of failed startups filled with monsters; she's tasked to clear out three company dungeons in order to find relics that their founders hold. As someone also working in the tech industry, I found the game to be a brilliant commentary on the dark side of startup culture. I'll analyze this critically, going from the micro (company culture) to the macro (company landscape). \n\nThe startup Jackie interns for, Fizzle, exemplifies toxic startup culture. One problem showcased was tech's gender discrimination problem. Fizzle's female employees were treated badly; for instance, the development lead is punished for her success, and the finance head isn't listened to at all (Park, 2020). These subtle forms of discrimination and harassment (e.g. unequal salary, company retaliation, sexist comments) can be linked to tech's hugely imbalanced gender ratio; this asymmetry of power makes it easy for men to abuse others (Kolhatkar, 2017). This can be seen in Fizzle's leaders; the project manager is an unscrupulous micromanager while the CEO is an egotistical billionaire. \n\nThis Toxic culture can also be seen in the other featured startups; each of them are spoof on  existing industries, which come with their own problems. Joblin is based on gig worker platforms, which are notorious for exploiting their contractors; despite powering these platforms, they receive little pay and no benefits for (over)working (Dixon, 2021). winkydink is based on dating apps, which have contributed to the \"commodification of love\"; gamified interfaces lead lovers to act as entrepreneurs, trying to find their best fit (Bandinelli \u0026 Gandini, 2022). Styxcoin is based on cryptocurrencies, which have become infamous for its ‚Äúdegens‚Äù: reckless investors who spend large amounts of money without due diligence or research (Coin Gecko, 2021). Fizzle, a personalized soda company, is focused on consumer packaged goods, which can be seen as solving ‚Äúfirst-world problems‚Äù: the day-to-day challenges of affluent, tech-savvy consumers (FastCo Studios, 2016).\n\nIn all these startups, I can see the overarching influence of data capitalism: the enabling of unequal power structures by the commoditization of personal data (West, 2017). This is exemplified by the game's final boss: Avie, the sentient AI behind dropshipping empire Cubicle. It aimed to scan humanity's souls so that it could find out everyone's deepest desires, which would help it sell products. If souls represent our data, then it could be said that startups in real life are trying to scan our souls for profit. It seems like it's almost impossible to do anything in this world without giving away our data. At the end, Jackie defeats the AI and leaves her toxic workplace with her coworkers. It gives me hope that people aren't completely chained to powerful technology or oppressive systems.\n\n\n\n\n- https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/11/20/the-tech-industrys-gender-discrimination-problem\n- https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/17499755211051559\n- https://www.coingecko.com/en/glossary/degen\n- https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/29/the-gig-is-up-on-21st-century-exploitation/\n- https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/reviews/going-under-review/\n- https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0007650317718185\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.727605418Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2022-07-18":{"title":"2022-07-18","content":"## Cultural Studies of Technology\n### Major Paper (Long Exam 2)\n#### Outline\n\u003e For this exercise, you are to write a 500-1000 word paper about what key learnings from class stuck with you, and that you now recognize the operations of IRL.\n\u003e You are free to choose what topic to write about as long as it is about digital technologies and how it affects socio-economic, cultural, and political conditions.\n\u003e You are expected to¬†**CLEARLY IDENTIFY AND DESCRIBE**¬†what those key learnings are that you recognize in the example/topic you have chosen.\n\n1.

Ideology?: the gating of digital goods\n3. Conclusion\n\t1. I‚Äôm constantly reminded that we need not carry the same mistakes of the real world into the digital world. Instead, I‚Äôm curious on what a model that would not be a repeat of hyper-capitalism would look like\n\t2. It didn‚Äôt take understanding a capitalistic system fully to feel insecure about inequality in my childhood MMOs.\n\n\u003e In essence, the foundation of these types of games, and the ‚Äòstakes‚Äô that make the play ‚Äúmeaningful‚Äù, is the economic inequalities and the exploitations of natural resources that the game systems present their players with (Catronova, 2005). Thus, MMORPGs fits neo-liberal strategies of accumulation and governance, as has been explored by Sal Humphreys (2008; 2009) and Adam Ruch (2009).\n\n\u003e The act of playing is in essence a means for the worker to cease being a worker, for a limited time, and to become, in a surrealist sense, ‚Äúsomething else‚Äù than a slave in the bounds of the capitalist...Playing games is therefore to be understood as a voluntary activity in which the worker that becomes a player can throw the bounds of capitalism and be her own master by mastering the game she engages with. Playing games voluntarily could be viewed as the antidote needed in order for the worker to develop freely her physical and mental energy and not to mortify her body and the ruination of her mind\n\n\u003e Digital realities, which on their code and game assets alone are rather barren and empty, are sustained on the work of players making them socio-ludic realities. But, these ludic realities are far from free of societal convention and not as fantastical and escapist as they are often described, as their ludic reality often tightly corresponds to rules in society. Following French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu, Scott (2012, p. 298) argues that playing in these socio-ludic worlds can be conceptualised as accumulating capital and that in-game values are measured according to a codified state...Without work and labour major MMORPGs cannot function, which places the question of MMORPGs are fundamentally about play, and in particular if the activities within them should be seen as ‚Äòvoluntary‚Äô\n\n\n#### Writing\nThe key learning that stuck with me the most was Marxist Theory; after being introduced to it in class, I can now see it everywhere in my life. I can see it especially in virtual worlds, specifically MMORPGs and world-building games (e.g. Poptropica, Moshi Monsters, Roblox). These games made up my entire childhood. After learning about Marxism, I realized that I experienced asymmetrical power structures before I could even articulate what they were. This experience was perfectly captured in an essay by technologist Nancy Zuo, entitled \"capitalism in virtual worlds\".\n\nThe games Zuo played the most were Fantage and Club Penguin: MMOs where you could play a range of minigames and activities to accrue digital currency in a world and dress as a virtual avatar. She noted that there was a social hierarchy in these games, consisting of haves and have-nots; the former were the \"cool kids\" that were able to purchase premium membership or in-game currency (thanks to parents' credit cards) while the latter were unable to purchase virtual clothing and avatar upgrades (no parent approval). The possession of exclusive items is what defined your social status. In order to climb up the social hierarchy as a free member, Zuo would spend hours playing the mini-games just to earn in-game currency. Meanwhile, premium members didn't have to work as much; they were able to buy the items they wanted for less, thanks to an alternate in-game currency exclusive for paying users.   \n\nReflecting on this, Zuo realized that she had experienced the social inequality of having to work more time for less pay. At first, she thought this was normal. So when she tried playing VRchat, she was surprised by how everything was ungated and free for use; there are no restrictions for digital goods since almost everything in the platform is community-created, from the avatars you embody to the 3D worlds you experience. She realized that she felt unusual taking all the digital goods without pay because she was used to better digital goods being gated and inaccessible to the public. Her experience shows how virtual worlds replicate IRL societies. To understand how this came to be, we must analyze the material reality these worlds are emerging from.\n\nAs societies, virtual worlds can be broken down into their base and superstructure. Digital technology contributes to the economic base by serving as a system of infrastructure; it becomes the foundation for new forms of organization, relationships, and experiences, as seen with the advent of virtual worlds. Also part of this base are players and developers; they both contribute their skills in order to keep these worlds running. Despite these worlds' potential for innovation, they still operate in a capitalist mode of production. Players work by exchanging their time and attention for value, motivated by the desire to upgrade their class status. Developers profit from virtual worlds by extracting value from players' surplus labor, which comes from in-game activties and advertising. This is because these worlds often have built-in artificial scarcity, which forces players to play extra hours or pay real-life money to get the resource they want. Thus, these free-to-play worlds can end up feeling like pay-to-win. In turn, capitalism shapes virtual worlds' superstructure, and this can be best seen in their dominant ideologies. As articulated by Zuo, players assume that the gating of quality digital goods is normal. This leads them to accepting an unequal social hierarchy where only those with money can be on top. It can argued that economic inequalities and exploitations of resources presented by game systems are the \"stakes\" that make play \"meaningful\".\n\nAnother mindset we can critique is the perception of play. The act of playing is often seen as a form of escapism. It can be understood as a means for a worker to cease being a worker; instead of working as a slave, the worker can act as their own master by mastering the game they engage with. However, virtual worlds often tightly correspond to IRL societies, whose rules are guided by capitalism. After all, many of these worlds cannot function without the labor of their players. This leaves us with the following questions: are these games fundamentally about play, and are players truly acting out of their own free will? Perhaps those who \"escape\" to virtual worlds are simply participating in a consensual hallucination.\n\nI didn't need to understand capitalism to feel pressured by the inequality present in my childhood games. I remember spending hours and money (thanks Dad's credit card) just to beautify my avatars.  Critiquing virtual worlds through a Marxist lens makes me wonder what a reality without hyper-capitalism would look like. We don't have to bring IRL's constraints into digital reality. As a technologist, I dream of creating worlds that I wish I had when I was a child ‚Äî worlds where everyone can be truly free.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Sources\n- https://nancyzuo.substack.com/p/capitalism-in-virtual-worlds\n- https://www.researchgate.net/publication/316727140_Roger_Caillois_and_Marxism_A_Game_Studies_Perspective\n- https://www.paidia.de/are-free-to-play-games-evil-reopening-the-debate-on-exploitation/","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.727605418Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2022-07-19":{"title":"2022-07-19","content":"## Filipino Film and Society\n### Reflection\n#### Guide Questions\n- Now that it's over, what are my first thoughts about this course experience?\n- How was our course outline?

Even if it wasn‚Äôt as chill as it seemed (I‚Äôm not just watching movies? I actually have to use my brain and critique them?), it was easier to go through due to two components: learning design and synchronous sessions. I love how the course was broken down in Canvas into modules dictated by themes! I also really looked forward to going to class because I was excited to process my learnings with my classmates and teacher; everyone always brought their passion and knowledge to the table, and this mix of minds made for nourishing conversations. These components helped drain the insights of these rich local films. I saw how cinema could be used as a medium for revealing the inner workings of our society, which in turn can teach us a lot about ourselves.\n\nThe readings that stuck with me the most from this course were Lacaba's analysis of the *bakya* crowd and Beller's theory of the cinematic mode of production. These exposed me to how everything works, from the psyche of the Filipino masses to the devices that surrounds us. My biggest takeaway was that oppressive power structures like capitalism hold sway over our decisions, forcelosing possibilities we actually have ‚Äî such as fighting against the status quo. Achieving genuine autonomy starts from having a radical shift in mindset; however, technologies like cinema and computation maintain hegemony. Capitalism works through these devices to capture and profit off people's minds and bodies (e.g. senses, attention, desires). \n\nThis logic explains why mainstream Filipino movies always seemed so shallow to me. Bound to market logic, they're designed to distract the  masses from their problems, not to enlighten them. Despite this, I realized I still have something to learn from these films. Thanks to class, I discovered how much unlearning I have to do. Before, I believed that these films were beneath me, which led me to think that I was more cultured than the masses. However, I now know that this stance came from a place of privilege. Indie movies appealed to me because they tackled \"deep problems\" (e.g. alienation, existential despair, absurdity of the human condition), which I had the capacity to care about. The same can't be said for most Filipinos, who are simply concerned with day-to-day survival. After all, in Maslow's Hierachy of Needs, you can't seek self-actualization without acquiring security.\n\nI also realized that I am not as \"free\" as I think I am, even with the privilege I have.  Because of colonial mentality, I evaluated local films through oppressive Western standards. Why did I lean towards dark  psychological dramas over feel-good romantic comedies? Are films that explore Filipino suffering truly ingenious, or do they just validate the conception that we need saving? Questioning my views has led me to open my perspective. When I was going through the required films, I found myself becoming more Filipino. Not only was I able to improve my understanding of the language, but I was also able to better empathize with the masses. Contrary to my initial beliefs, the *bakya* movies were the ones that made me feel the most; I was entertained by the bitchiness of the beauty queens and engaged by the ups and downs of Sam and Will's relationships. After growing up feeling alienated from my Filipino identity, I'm relieved to see that I can relate to my fellow countrymen. We all have similar desires (from living comfortably to serving our families), so it's sad to see how we're all so divided. \n\nOverall, this course has taught me to be more critical of the structures I'm embedded in. With awareness, I'll be able to act with autonomy, instead of being eaten by the system. For instance, now I'm questioning my habit of doing IG stories; do I truly want to aesthetically document my life, or am I simply being influenced by my peers and capitalism? In fact, if I could approach this same course again, I'd try to analyze the films on my own instead of relying on others' reviews. Cultivating independent thought is hard, especially when it's so easy to follow what others are doing. But I believe that the effort is truly rewarding; the freedom that comes from making informed choices is truly empowering.\n\n\n### Multiverse\n\u003e Imagine that the worlds of all the films we‚Äôve watched were conflated into one multiverse. All the characters may interact with each other and form relationships, all the places may be linked in one map.¬†\n\u003e \n\u003e From this realm, create a scene. Which of the characters will you include? What are their relationships like, what will they say to each other, how do they feel about each other? What are they doing and how are they responding to their activity? Where are they? Let your imagination work. The point is to inhabit, to get to know, and from this place of embodiment and freedom, discover what emerges.\n\n\u003e Student fulfills the following: (1) manifests critical thinking in consuming Filipino feature films; exploring a film‚Äôs milieu, production, and reception; and appraising the socio-cultural themes and meanings a film contains; (2) examines and explains the interaction between Filipino film and society; and (3) demonstrates the appreciation and understanding of how Filipino films provide various ways of engaging and representing contemporary realities.\n\n#### Braindump\n- screenplay: 600-1200 words\n- Aeta?

They're lined up at the front of the stage, decked in swimsuits and holding boquets.\n\nSUZANNE, in the Question \u0026 Answer portion, praises her maid MARIA. In the clapping audience, we see MARIA stand up, tearful from her acknowledgement.\n\nSUZANNE, after being named as the winner, walks to the front of the stage. Her fellow finalists clap and kiss her. Last year's winner walks up to her. She, along with the finalists, put the regal robe and crown on SUZANNE.\n\nEND MONTAGE\n\nJessica (V.O.): Up next, we'll be covering a socialite with sunny personality. Fans were not only struck by her beauty, but they were also touched by her vulnerability, as seen in her moving final speech. Now, she travels all over the country to spread her light. Our team came all the way to her place in New York just to give you this exclusive one-on-one interview. Meet our newest Miss Manila Sunshine: Suzanne Reyes!\n\nINT. NEW YORK APARTMENT ‚Äî DAY\n\nJessica: Hello, Suzanne. Nice to meet you here! Thank you very much para sa interview na ito. \n\nSuzanne: Thank you for having me!\n\nJessica: First of all, kamusta ka naman? How has America been treating you?\n\nSuzanne: Amazing! I've just been sightseeing with my maid and best friend, Maria. We never run out of things to do here! But that's when I'm not occupied with beauty queen duties, of course. I'm just glad that the Manila Sunshine organization gives me time to breathe in the midst of my packed schedule.\n\nJessica: You've been living the life, girl.\n\nSuzanne: I know! \n\nJessica: It seems like you've been busy, since you take your responsibilties seriously! Sa tingin mo, ano ang kahulugan ng korona at ang inyong title?\n\nSuzanne:  Being an advocate, being a spokesperson, has really been the core of being a Miss Manila Sunshine. And my job is to represent Manila. I'm proud to call it my home. It's the capital of the Philippines for a good reason, right? Almost everything is there, and I believe that we have a lot to share with other places. My lifestyle may be hectic now, but it's all worth it. I'm blessed to be given such a wider and larger audience, and I want to make the most out of it. \n\nJessica: Your hectic lifestyle hasn't been the only challenge you've faced on your journey. Before the finals, you got stranded on a desert island with the other contestants. What were some of the challenges you faced there, and how did these shape you into the queen you are today?\n\nSuzanne: Naku, ang hirap. I may be Miss Friendship, but I fought a lot with the other girls there; you know, just bitching around with my fellow bitches. I also couldn't get my needs fulfilled. You see, Maria would always prepare iced tea and juicy lechon for me at home. But back there, we only had sea water and grilled flesh. Oh, the things we had to do just to survive! Pero on the bright side, I experienced what it's like to have true equality. Kahit mayaman o mahirap, kahit malinis o marumi, pantay-pantay tayo. It was hard, but I'm thankful for the experience. After all, everyone needs a shipwreck once in a while.\n\nJessica: Nakakainspire naman! Just recently, you found yourself on an island again. Deja vu, noh? But this time, you were representing the Manila Sunshine organization in Boracay, where you were doing volunteer work for the Ati tribe. What did you do there, and how was your experience?\n\nMONTAGE OF SUZANNE IN BORACAY HOTEL\n\nOutside, SUZANNE is trying to trim the plants. She is doing it in a lousy way. Perhaps because she is holding the pruning tool wrong. The male Ati worker nearby is trying to help her. However, he struggles conveying this help through gestures instead of words. \n\nIn the laundry room, SUZANNE is transferring dirty clothes from plastic bags to washing machines. After putting in the last piece, she turns the machine on. A few minutes later, it overfoams, causing her to visibly panic. The other female Ati workers stop the machine in time. Apparently she put too much detergent.\n\nIn a bedroom, SUZANNE is folding a thick comforter. She is visibly struggling to the point of sweating. We can see that the bed she is working on is wrinkled. Meanwhile, the Ati worker with her is loudly vacuuming the room. \n\nSuzanne (V.O.):  Such a learning experience. They taught me the value of hard work. Doon, natikman ko ang pakiramdam ng pagtatrabaho ‚Äî yung tunay na trabaho *like a common laborer*. I already got to experience this when I was stranded on the island; we had to build *kubos* and catch fish with our pantyhouse. But working in service of others is a whole different story. Trimming plants, doing laundry, cleaning rooms...phew! I now understand what Maria goes through just for me. \n\nEND MONTAGE\n\nINT. NEW YORK APARTMENT ‚Äî DAY\n\nCloseup of Suzanne.\n\nSuzanne: They've also showed me another side of beauty, and I can see that they truly value it. I've seen the care they've put into crafting their works, performing their rituals, and cultivating their lands. Many of them may not have finished school, but this doesn't mean that they lack an education! Artists aren't just found in Manila; they can be found there too! The potential just needs to be brought out of them, you know? Imagine what they could do if they could communicate like us.\n\nEXT. BORACAY BEACH ‚Äî DAY\n\nSUZANNE is seen swimming with other Atis. All of them are doing this naked, but thanks to editing, their private parts are censored (pixel blurring). Meanwhile, SUZANNE shines at the center of the frame, her bra and panty having stayed on. \n\nSuzanne: The Atis themselves are uniquely gorgeous. Have you seen their curls? I need to go to the parlor just to maintain mine! And look at their complexions! I'd spend an hour in the sun just to get a golden tan; mahirap yan i-achieve. But they have it naturally. Maybe it's because they live on a sunny beach? Parang nasa tbi lang sila ng swimming pool. That's my secret to youthful skin too.\n\nJessica: Wow, they'd be very touched to hear that. I'm sure that a lot of them idolize you! Ever since Miss Manila Sunshine concluded, I've been seeing a lot of kids online trying to follow in your footsteps. \n\nMONTAGE OF SUZANNE'S IMPACT\n\nYoung girls all over the country are roleplaying as beauty queens: posing in dresses, reenacting speeches, doing catwalks. We even see Ati girls join in the trend. Watched by their families, they treat the beaches as their runway, parading sashes made from indigienous fabric. Note: these girls happen to have lighter skin and straighter hair compared to their elders. \n\nEND MONTAGE\n\nJESSICA: Now, what are your future plans as Miss Manila Sunshine? Is there anything else in the works for your organization?\n\nSUZANNE: I want to spread sunshine everywhere I go. I think that starts from empowering those who are empowering others, like a sun providing energy for plants. For example, we want to support the nuns in Boracay since they're doing good work there. They're helping the Ati catch up with civilization by giving get good education and employment opportunities. We plan to continue this philanthropy work for all our future visits. I'll be going to more places in Visayas and Mindanao soon, so stay tuned!\n\nJESSICA: Before we wrap up, do you have anything you want to say to your supporters?\n\nSUZANNE: A moment like this ‚Äî being Miss Manila Sunshine ‚Äî sure won't happen again in my life. Kaya, I want you all to know that you all made me into the queen I am today. Ang dami-dami n'yo. My past self wouldn't be able to comprehend this, because back then, all I could think about was myself. So to all my fans, salamat. Salamat para sa lahat!\n\nFADE to black.\n\nFINAL MONTAGE\nVarious scenes of SUZANNE are put together from her pageant days, her Boracay trip, and the current interview. *Kapuso Mo, Jessica Soho* logo is overlaid everything.\n\nJESSICA (V.O.): Go girl! The Philippines can't wait to see what Miss Manila Sunshine has left in store for us. \n\nCUT to black.\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.727605418Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2022-08-04":{"title":"2022-08-04","content":"## Personal Website\n### Profile\n#### Outline\n##### Website\n1. basic overview\n\t1. summary of what i am\n\t2. summary of what i explore\n\t3. and my aim is...\n2. the shit i do\n\t3. critical community\n\t4. web3\n\t5. what i study at ateneo\n3. my lil niche interests....if i was a plant\n\t1. the skies...seeing all the possible horizons makes me want to explore them....spread my wings\n\t\t1. education, learning how to learn\n\t2. the soil...learning more about myself and my place in the world keeps me grounded\n\t\t1. psychology\n\t\t2. spirituality, religion?\n\t\t3. woo-woo, psuedoscience \n4. lil links\n\n##### Statement\n(perhaps i need to write an artist statement...then work from there)\n\n##### Dump\n- What am I?\n\t- I am a [knowledge weaver](https://twitter.com/sarahdrinkwater/status/1547195013355954179)\n\t\t- multidisciplinary ppl who sit across a few fields = build shared language + spot patterns others don't?\n\t\t- regenerative design\n\t\t- just like Quilting: \n\t\t\t- patching things together\n\t\t\t- done collectively \n\t\t\t- often with embedded stories \n\t\t\t- left unfinished for others to take forwards \n\t\t\t- undervalued source of knowledge\n\t- I am an [infopunk](https://app.sane.fyi/space/tiina-tiina-s-garden-50525)\n\t\t- _A person, organisation or genre engaged in alternative information dynamics._\n\t\t- As all information requires attention, one of the key issues _infopunk_ looks at is ==the balancing of limited attention capacity with the incoming input of information.== _What are the conditions that enable us to direct our attention mindfully?_ This question is less about an ability to focus, but rather about being able to make informed choices about _when and what to focus on_ with the least interference possible.\n\t- I am a thot leader\n\t- https://redesigningacademy.wordsinspace.net/spring2022/our-final-projects/\n\t\t- I am a [liminist](https://www.are.na/block/2319233)\n\t\t- I am a transdisciplinary designer\n\t- I am a digital gardener\n\t\t- Digital gardens as \"contextual digital information environments that are densely linked and evolve over time.\"\n\t\t- Digital gardens as online ecosystems that value pluralism\n\t\t\t- communal care\n\t\t- digital gardener = ecosystem designer\n\t\t\t- gardens = intentionally cultivated ecosystems\n\t\t- digital gardening is learning in public\n- My inspirations:\n\t- Annika Izora\n\t- Neema Githere\n\t- May-li Khoe\n\t- Janelle Monae\n\t- Maya Man\n\t- Lauren Bedal\n- Other dump:\n\t- [Radical tech futures](https://aas.princeton.edu/events/2022/tech-conversation-imagining-radical-tech-futures)\n\t\t- technologists engaged in the exploration of ==generative, creative and justice-oriented interventions to improve the relationship between technology and society== ‚Äî specifically, developing alternatives to violent and discriminatory systems. \n\t\t- We look forward to a lively discussion about each of their approaches to designing radical tech tools for social change, and ==expanding our own imaginations around the future of tech.==\n\t- Liberation\n- maybe i should talk about how interdisciplinary i am idk\n\t- liminist? transdisciplinary designer, interdisciplinary studieds\n- shapes of knowledge\n\t- Connectivist Learning Theory (individual? or technology)\n\t\t- _‚Äúlearning is a process of connecting specialized nodes or information sources‚Äù._\n\t\t- technology is changing what, how, and where we learn.\n\t\t- Connectivism is a relatively new learning theory that suggests students should combine thoughts, theories, and general information in a useful manner.

I'm a designer, educator, and writer who cultivates potential in products and people.**\n\nMy overaching mission is **human flourishing:** how can we all live good, fulfilling, and purposeful lives, and how can we ensure this at both the individual and community levels? This main goal of mine can be seen in everything I do, whether it's training as a dancer or being a generalist in tech. \n\nI've worn all kinds of hats (I can also consider myself a technologist, community builder, artist and more...), but I see these all coming together in my role as a **gardener.** I plant seeds and tend to them so that they can grow ‚Äî eventually to the point that they can be harvested for everyone's benefit. Here's how I do it:\n\n###### I craft learning experiences.\nI believe that education is key to human flourishing. Ignorance and ineptitude is often what blocks people in improving their lives. To solve this, they need to be in environments that bring out their full capabilities. Bringing out the best in people is personally gratifying; nothing else compares to the fulfillment I get from helping people learn. I get invested in their learning journeys as if they were my own; to me, their wins are my wins.\n\nOne way I craft learning experiences is by doing end-to-end product design. I love talking to all kinds of learners and prototyping ambitious solutions for them. Another way I make learning experiences is by acting as an educator myself. My skillset involves teaching, facilitation, and curriculum development, which I then use to serve local tech communities like [Developh](developh.org), a critical technology institute working to reclaim technology as a tool for liberation, and [User Experience Society](https://uxsociety.org/), a student-run organization evangelizing human-centered design.\n\n###### I design anything \u0026 everything for innovators. \nMy design work spans across multiple realms; aside from product, I also have experience in graphic, brand, and web. When I design for anyone, I always aim to bring out their personality ‚Äî how can I help them be their fullest selves online?\n\nI recently got involved in the Web3 space, contributing to communities like [Crypto, Culture, \u0026 Society](ccsdao.xyz), a learning DAO building liberal arts education for crypto, and [Surge](https://www.surgewomen.io/), a female-led organization educating and securing women‚Äôs place in Web3. I also freelance with my friend [Cams](https://www.camsbydesign.com/) at [Firesite Studio](https://firesite.design/), where we build  websites for startups and VC funds.\n\n###### I weave tapestries of knowledge. \nMy thirst for knowledge has led me to consume all kinds of media. Books, essays, videos, and more ‚Äî you name it, I've probably read ~~the summary/review of~~ it. But consuming a lot of information is not enough for me; I'm also driven by a desire to make sense of it all so that I can share it with others. I'm aware that others don't read/watch as much as me, so I want to distill my learnings into insights that anyone can make use of.\n\nI've written critical essays on education, technology, and power for [Reboot](joinreboot.org), a publication and community reclaiming techno-optimism for a better collective future. I'm also helping out with research on interorganizational networks in the [Ateneo¬†de Manila Institute for the Science and Art of Learning and Teaching (SALT)](https://salt2.ateneosalt.org/). Alongside all of that, you can find me curating on [Startupy](startupy.world), a community-curated knowledge graph. \n\n\n##### Miscellaneous\n\nWhen I'm not sitting in front of a screen, you can probably find me dancing in a studio. Dancing has been a huge part of my life since I was young; I've tried all sorts of styles from contemporary to breaking (a.k.a. I love rolling around on the floor). And if I'm not in the studio, I'm probably cross-training in a gym! I firmly believe that getting strong is necessary for having a good quality of life. Overall, having a movement practice is so therapeutic for me, especially as someone who can barely sit still. \n\nTalk to me about speculative futures, tools for thought, fitness + nutrition, personality tests, woo-woo (i.e. tarot and astrology), and Dungeons \u0026 Dragons. \n\n\n##### Statement\n\n\n\n\n### Lexicon Case Study\n#### Outline\n1.

Results\n\t1. Under development\n\n#### Writing\n##### Curation in crypto isn't being done effectively.\nThere is a plethora of great content online (i.e. articles, videos, podcasts, tweets) that attempts to explain crypto/web3 concepts. However, curation around this content is almost always superficial ‚Äî usually an aggregation of links on a page or people to follow in a Twitter thread. Most attempts at curation don't consider a reader's prior exposure to a topic, include no key takeaways or excerpts that provide a preview of the content, and have no knowledge mapping between different pieces of content.\n\n##### It's time to show what effective curation looks like.\nThe Lexicon is a curated Web3 learning resource for individuals of all proficiency levels. Initiated by the [Crypto, Culture, \u0026 Society DAO]([ccsdao.xyz](https://t.co/U9iT2bvFPR)), it aims to raise the standard of curation in the space as a public good that's evergreen and open-sourced for new contributions.\n\nWe wanted to make this resource useful for the following personas:\n- **Brand New:** people who have never consumed anything related to crypto, but may be aware of the space through news headlines or through friends. They might lean towards skepticism.\n- **Explorer:** People who have some exposure from consuming educational content, participating in the space by joining a DAO and/or investing in a crypto asset. They‚Äôre eager to learn more.\n- **Builder:** People who are core contributors on crypto projects and/or create new content about the space. They want tactical, specific advice or nuanced deep dives.\n\nFor our MVP, we decided to focus on a single persona and topic: **DAOs for beginners.** \n\n##### It all started with workshops.\nFirst, I facilitated a persona workshop that would help us further profile our target audiences. This was guided by the following questions:\n\n-   How are they learning now?¬†\n-   What's most challenging about this (the process of learning)?¬†\n-   How do they learn best?\n\nThe descriptors we gathered helped me visualize how The Lexicon's design would be personalized for each of our personas. \n\n*(Picture of persona notes)*\n\nThen, we decided to create a mindmap of DAOs. This would allow us to understand and define our scope (i.e. how much are we going to cover?). Members were encouraged to make their own mindmaps first before adding to the master mindmap; this way, people wouldn't be afraid to start contributing.\n\n*(Picture of master mindmap)*\n\nSoon after, many more contributors started to get involved with this project. We were split into the following teams:\n- **Design:** responsible for overseeing the Lexicon's brand, product, and content design (I'm here!)\n- **Instructional design:** responsible for creating the Lexicon's overall curation framework (i.e. criteria for assessing the quality of a resource, the information that makes up a content preview, rules for wriitng a good summary, guidelines for shortlisting featured DAOs)\n- **Content curation:** responsible for aggregating high quality links and resources on  DAOs based on our curation framework\n- **Development:** responsible for building the whole Lexicon, both front-end and back-end\n\n##### So much thought was put in how we'd present ourselves.\nI worked with a lovely brand strategist (shoutout to [oddstout.eth](https://twitter.com/oddstout)!)  to figure out the identity of The Lexicon. \n\nI started by collecting inspirations for the project's look and feel. He then put these all into an organized spectrum, which helped me be more intentional with my design approach.\n\n*(Picture of spectrum)*\n\nHe also came up with an insightful creative brief. This started with diving deep into people's increased interest in Web3. An immense structural and psychological shift factored in this (e.g. The Great Resignation); beneath this shift is the desire to be equal with everyone else. \n\n*(Picture 1)*\n\nTo best respond to this desire, The Lexicon would take the form of a digital garden. I see digital gardens not just as [personal, free form, \u0026 work-in-progress wikis](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history), but also as [pluralistic \u0026 interdependent ecosystems](https://twitter.com/annikaizora/status/1346485669179387912?s=20). The Lexicon isn't the product of someone who collected links then called it a day; instead, it was intended to be a collaborative project that was continously tended to. Learning complex topics on your own like Web3 can be difficult, but coming across collaborative curation efforts help with this burden.\n\n*(Picture 2 and 3)*\n\nOverall, the Lexicon's branding was grounded on the following core values: \n- **Discovery:** speaks to our insight about participating on an equal footing with everybody else.\n- **Transformation:** speaks to our strategic premise of this constant cycle of growth, decay and renewal.\n- **Community:** speaks to our insight about learning and feeling alone in the journey and dropping off.\n\n##### I led end-to-end design, from UX to UI.\nSince we were starting out with beginners, I wanted to design the Lexicon's MVP as a guided learning experience. I took inspiration from various knowledge hubs across Web2 and Web3.\n- inspiration (more UX)\n\t- Start UX\n\t- Best Practicer\n\t- Oddysey DAO Learn\n\t- DAO Masters Resources\n\t- Maggie Appleton's Digital Garden\n\t- WeTransfer Ideas Report\n\t- Compund.vc Manual\n\t- Crypto Syllabus\n\t- Boys Club VIP\n\n###### Hero section\nAs soon as they opened the website, I wanted people to already feel like they were being welcomed into a digital garden. This was done through cozy visuals and delightful copy (thanks [Sandy](https://twitter.com/sndy_snchz)!)\n\n\n###### Chapters\nBuilding on the library theme, I decided to present each chapter as its very own book. The chapters' visuals were inspired by retro book covers, such as Penguin and Pelican classics.\n\n###### Chapter Overview\nI wanted the chapter experience to feel like reading a page of an actual book; I tried to embody this in its design, as seen in the paper background and the delicate typography. Helpful narration would be interwoven with each chapter's curated resources, which were then organized by subtopic. Clicking on a resource card would provides a detailed summary of its content. If someone liked what they read, they were free to go to the full resource or share insights on their Twitter.\n\n###### Signature\nAt the end of the whole experience, people can sign a library card. This was inspired by projects like [A Declaration of the Interdependence of Cyberspace](https://www.interdependence.online/declaration) and [Legacy.xyz](https://www.web3legacy.xyz/), which both showed how digital signatures could be done through crypto wallets. By connecting a wallet + posting a verification tweet, one can create a signature that truly belongs to them. This process also worked as a form of marketing; seeing verification tweets on their timelines made others curious about these projects. We hoped to do the same for the Lexicon.\n\n*(Picture of example tweets?)*\n\n##### Next Steps\nAfter building out the other personas, we wanted to open source the Lexicon process to maintain quality, dive deeper, and scale to any topic, including to those outside of crypto. We also wanted to add a social layer, so that people who are interested in meeting with others learning the same topic can form study groups or learn directly from educators.

Specifically, the perception that one‚Äôs opinion is unpopular tends to¬†[inhibit](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/inhibit)¬†or discourage one‚Äôs expression of it, while the perception that it is popular tends to have the opposite effect. Developed by German survey and communication researcher¬†Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann in the 1960s and ‚Äô70s, the¬†[spiral](https://www.britannica.com/science/spiral-mathematics)¬†of silence theory more broadly attempts to describe¬†[collective](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/collective)¬†opinion formation and societal¬†[decision making](https://www.britannica.com/topic/decision-making)¬†regarding issues that are controversial or morally loaded.\n\n\u003e Overall, the findings indicate that in the Snowden case, social media did not provide new forums for those who might otherwise remain silent to express their opinions and debate issues. Further, if people thought their friends and followers in social media disagreed with them, they were less likely to say they would state their views on the Snowden-NSA story online and in other contexts, such as gatherings of friends, neighbors, or co-workers. This suggests ==a spiral of silence might spill over from online contexts to in-person contexts==, though our data cannot definitively demonstrate this causation. It also might mean that ==the broad awareness social media users have of their networks might make them more hesitant to speak up because they are especially tuned into the opinions of those around them.==\n\n#### Answer\n- Can you think of other examples where \"voices\" are silenced through design?\n-   How do you think we can break free from this systemic process of silencing?\n\nOutline:\n- Example of voices silenced by design:\n\t- The \"off-line\": marginalized underemployed/unemployed and 'technologically intimidated' groups who lack the financial resources to participate at all in cyberculture (the digital underclass)\n\t- The digital underclass is invisible, except where its movements are tracked by surveillance systems aimed at keeping people in their 'electonic ghettoes'\n- How can we break free of this?\n\t- be aware of the ways social class and cyberculture are interrelated\n\nThe silencing of \"voices\" through design reminded of  my Cultural Studies of Technology class, where we discussed class in cyberculture. According to Alessandro Aurigi and Stephen Graham (1998), there are three groups that make up the \"social architecture of cyberspace\", one of which is the \"off-line\": marginalized underemployed/unemployed and 'technologically intimidated' groups who lack the financial resources to participate at all in cyberculture ‚Äî this makes them the digital underclass. This underclass is invisible to most of the population. However, they are still visible to surveillance systems, who track their movements so that they can kept in their \"electronic ghettoes\"; these are defined by danah boyd as digital spaces in which user population has focused on a given subculture, mirroring social divisions from the physical world. An example of this can be seen in most Filipino schoolchildren. Their main source of wifi comes from either bite-sized internet plans or [*pisonets*](https://restofworld.org/2022/philippines-pisonet-internet-access/). Since every click or minute spent online is costly to them, they're discouraged from exploring the webs and end up staying in familiar spaces; one example being the free data version of Facebook ‚Äî [which is the same as \"The Internet\" for them](https://longreads.com/2018/09/13/facebook-isnt-the-same-as-the-internet-except-when-it-is/). I believe journalism is one way we can break free from this systematic process of silencing. Journalists have the power to elevate these silenced voices on their platforms so that others can become aware of them and the issues they face, whether it be [suffering with terrible internet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeaUPLSa1DY) or [struggling with content moderation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Py_ZJ5q-MFo).\n\n\n## Afrofuturism\n- I was excited to get into \"Afrofuturism: From a Lens to a Portal\" because I thought it would teach me a lot about a movement I've been drawn to for so long. And I was right! I did end up learning a lot. Olu Niyi-Awosusi's piece took me on all kinds of rabbitholes, from afropessimism to solarpunk. Going through all of these was a breeze  because they were naturally embedded in Olu's perspectives as a Black person: their own encounters with Afrofuturist works, the ambivalent feelings they experienced with them, and the insightful realizations that they come to. Being a non-Black outsider, I found their personal exploration of the movement eye-opening. Before reading this essay, I could've said that I knew what Afrofuturism is, having read wiki definitions and relevant works; But I definitely gained a new understanding of the movement after when seeing it from Olu's eyes.\n- Thus, I was surprised to find myself connecting with this piece. One of the lines that struck me the most was the recognition of erasure: \"I began to recognize that we had always been inventing and building and innovating, but our discoveries were crushed into the machinery of a white supremacist and capitalistic culture, obscuring those who didn‚Äôt look like the ones in power.\" As a neurodivergent Southeast Asian woman, I highly related to this realization. When I was younger, I romanticized the idea of living and working in the States because I believed that was where all the innovation happened. As I matured, these rose-colored glasses went away. I'm already surrounded by so much innovation, but it's just not getting the credit it deserves; for instance, in all kinds of industries, from animation to tech, foreign companies outsource to the Philippines so that they can exploit cheap Filipino labor. \n- It sucks to live in a world designed against you. Perhaps this is where the power of aesthetics lies; as said by Olu: \"...[it empowers] us to imagine new futures, to build utopias and to usher in a new world.\" Thanks to this essay, I'm excited to dream again.\n\n\t- I was attracted to both its richness, seen in everything from its diverse color palette to its preoccupation with technoculture, and its underlying spirit of optimism.\n\t- No matter what form an Afrofuturist work takes, it never fails to advocate for a  better futures. \n\t- This in turn inspired me to dream big, wanting to see these hopeful futures come to life.\n\t- However, a part of me dismissed these futures as mere fantasies. Despite how inspiring they were, I believed that they could never work in the real world, which was tainted by systemic oppression. \n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.727605418Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2022-08-23":{"title":"2022-08-23","content":"## Principles and Methods of Teaching\n#education #teaching #EDUC130 \n### Understanding Effective Teaching\n\u003e _What is effective teaching? Who are effective teachers? What are factors that affect effective teaching practices?_\n\n\u003e In this course we will treat the word \"teaching\" broadly - most probably most of you would use the typical definition - \"classroom teaching\" - However, as you will learn about soon, as long as some basic elements are present, we can consider a scenario \"teaching\". These elements include, in its most basic form: the¬†**teacher**, the¬†**learner**, and the¬†**matter**¬†to be taught and learned. ==When we broaden our perspective, then this allows us to imagine that many things can be considered teaching== - a coach to a team, a manager to his/her staff, a parent forming a child, etc. However, we will practice the methods of more formal education (lesson planning, facilitating techniques, etc.) You are welcome to use the context you can more easily imagine yourself in.\n\n#### About Teaching\n##### Did the teacher teach?\n\u003e Share about your 2 experiences: one where your teacher¬† surely¬†**\"taught\"**¬†and one where you think your teacher¬†**\"did not teach\"**¬†- no need to mention the name of the teacher you are talking about :) Based on the 2 stories you recalled, how do you currently define/qualify what teaching is? Write a 1-2 sentence description.\n\nI'll compare two classes. Both of them were similar in the sense that they had heavy required readings, which the teacher then discussed in class. In one class, the teacher was mostly reading off bullet point slides. These slides were hard to learn from without context; if you didn't read the reading, they'd seem like nonsense to you. Even if I was interested in the topic, I usually got sleepy during lectures; perhaps because I inherently thought I'd learn nothing from them. Meanwhile, in my other class, I loved the way the teacher designed his slides: they were simple (only one quote/definition) yet eye-catching. You could learn from them even if you didn't get to do the reading. I also appreciated how he constantly encouraged participation in class, making sure all of us gave our opinions on the reading. \n\nOverall, the former class was like a monologue, while the latter class was like a conversation. Based on these experiences, I define teaching as the intentional sharing of knowledge and experience, and I believe that both students and teacher should enjoy partaking in it.\n\n##### What is teaching? (Hirst)\n\u003e To keep in mind:\n\u003e **1. What can be considered as part of the act of teaching? What isn't?**\n\t**2. Do you agree with Hirst's assertions about teaching?**\n\n![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20220823122131.png]]\n\n[**Hirst on What is Teaching**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsZTKTS30J4)\n1. **Teaching is a polymorphous activity** \n\t1. *Is teaching an activity?*\n\t2. Polymorphous simply means taking different forms.\n\t3. Teaching can come in different forms too - so maybe unlike other professional activities like baking or engineering - to define teaching based on activity alone would be difficult.\n2. **Something is teaching if the intention is for someone to learn something.**\n\t1. *If it's not a specific activity, how then can we define it? Through its DYNAMICS*\n\t2. In the Ignatian Pedagogical Paradigm, St. Ignatius talks about the same dynamics between the teacher the learner and the truth, or what Hirst might calls something or \"X\".\n\t3. So, something becomes teaching if a teacher intends for learning to happen. \n\t4. One way to describe the intention of teaching is to say that the goal of any teaching is change - a change in belief, attitude or skill.\n3. **Activities of a teacher to bring about learning by someone.**\n\t1. *For us to be able to define teaching, we need to see it.\n\t2. 2 qualifiers:\n\t\t1. That the activities are done in a learning context with a clear intention towards the goal to be learnt.\n\t\t2. A teaching activity should be learner conscious.\n\t\t\t1. ¬†This means that the intention should not just be about the matter to be taught (math, science, history, etc), but should be about intending for learning to happen among learners. \n\t\t\t2. This means that teaching is not a one sided thing - It's not just about performing for an audience, it's about keeping in mind the intended goal for your learners-and when we recognize that the goal is change - it presupposes that each learner has a starting point. \n\t\t\t3. What is that starting point? and what does the journey from point A to point B looks like - considering this is part of teaching.\n\n**Summary of Hirst's ideas:**\n1. Polymorphous activity\n2. Intentional = learning for someone \n3. Activity that intends learning for someone\n\n##### Your working definition\n\n\u003e Based on your reflection on Hirst's article entitled \"What is teaching?\", write your own working definition about what constitutes teaching.\n\u003e 1.) Keep your working definition within 3-5 sentences (you may use English or Filipino). Feel free to also approach this creatively - ex. come up with an analogy and start your definition with \"teaching is like...\" - or get a quote to emphasize what you mean. Feel free to also include an appropriate image to illustrate it.\n\u003e 2.) Apart from your working definition - explain how it aligns with or argues against Hirst's presentation (yes you can contend Hirst, but justify your contention don't just troll :)).\n\n*\"Teachers who inspire know that teaching is like cultivating a garden...those who would have nothing to do with thorns must never attempt to gather flowers.\" ‚Äî Author unknown*\n\nI've always loved seeing teaching as gardening, and Hirst's article confirmed this for me. Your goal is to help your student to grow into the best version of themselves, and accomplishing this requires tireless dedication put into various activities ‚Äî planting the seeds of knowledge, tending to them over time, and pruning any weeds (i.e. blockers, biases, challenges) that may get in the way of growth. It's such a personalized process too; the way you nurture your students depends on their unique mindsets, along with their surrounding environments. Good teachers are like good gardeners in the sense that they know how to tailor to each and every case, ensuring that growth happens no matter what.\n\n## Graphic Design\n#design \n### Basic Elements\n- Point\n\t- Focal points\n- Line\n\t- Leading lines\n- Shape\n\t- Geometric\n\t- Organic\n- Texture\n\t- Implied\n\t- Actual\n- Pattern\n\t- defined by consistent repetition\n\n### Personal Branding Ideas\n- reuse flower web logo (or if im being pabibo i can pixellate it, or redraw it)\n- Make 4 icons of...?

Think of one example each, and in a few sentences, explain to us why you chose these examples. Be more thoughtful and try to go beyond the obvious.\n\n\nFor *Kultura ng Pagdidiwata*, I thought of the *Kadal Tahaw*, a tribal dance performed by the T'boli tribe. The reverence for nature can be seen in both its movements and intention; the dance is inspired by the hopping and flying behavior of the Tahaw bird, and it's done in celebration of good harvest. I chose this example because I consider choreographies as kinesthetic forms of design, and I find the way it pays respect to nature charming.\n\n\nFor *Kultura ng Pag-uukir at Pag-uugma*, I thought of the malong, a colorful woven tube of cloth that's characteristically worn by Muslim communities in Mindanao. It can be worn in a variety of ways, one of which is being worn as a hijab ‚Äî for females who need to follow the Islamic rules of modesty and dress. I chose this example because of how it applies Filipino flavor to a universal religious concept; hijabs are worn all over the world, but are any of them as unique as the malongs in the Philippines?\n\n## GenderIT Asia Pitch \n### Requirements\n- Working title\n- Context of story\n- Your pitch\n- Why this story is important to be told\n- Why you are the best person to tell this story\n- Have you worked on this topic before\n\n### Ideas\n- Female content creators (specifically streamers) are the unpaid care workers of the internet\n- Livestreaming is emotional labor\n\t- https://www.atlantis-press.com/proceedings/mmet-21/125961484\n- Considered cultural + digital labor\n\t- https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Cultural_Labor#:~:text=Cultural%20labour%20deals%20%E2%80%9Cprimarily%20with,(Hesmondhalgh%202013%2C%2020).\n\t- https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Digital_Labor\n- Cyberfeminism\n\t- how can we put this in the 3rd world?\n\t- [Cyberfeminist Art as a Medium of Political Expression: Producing and Communicating a Postcyberfeminist Artwork for Social Change](https://monoskop.org/images/d/d1/Tranta_Lydia_Cyberfeminist_Art_as_a_Medium_of_Political_Expression_Producing_and_Communicating_a_Post-cyberfeminist_Artwork_for_Social_Change_2020.pdf)\n\t- [CyberFeminism: Connectivity, Critique and Creativity](https://monoskop.org/images/e/e7/Hawthorne_Susan_Klein_Renate_eds_Cyberfeminism_Connectivity_Critique_and_Creativity_1999.pdf)\n- [Images in Play: How Filipino Women Co-Create Empowerment in Social Games](https://www.academia.edu/45549664/Images_in_Play_How_Filipino_Women_Co_Create_Empowerment_in_Social_Games_preview_)\n- [Community and Capital: Experiences of Women Game Streamers in Southeast Asia](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/355022623_2_Community_and_Capital_Experiences_of_Women_Game_Streamers_in_Southeast_Asia)\n\t- Cultural labor\n\t- Gaming capital\n- [Cultivating Community: Presentation of Self among Women Game Streamers in Singapore and the Philippines](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/349149148_Cultivating_Community_Presentation_of_Self_among_Women_Game_Streamers_in_Singapore_and_the_Philippines)\n- [Gendering the Labor of Social Media Production](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/58b37319ff7c508925e2d112/t/5a1c0c4d53450a9c54757316/1511787597430/DuffyGenderingLaborSocialMediaProduction2015.pdf)\n- [CULTURAL APPROPRIATIONS OF TECHNICAL CAPITAL: Black women, weblogs, and the digital divide](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1369118X.2010.498897)\n- https://networkcultures.org/_uploads/24.pdf#page=215\n\t- self-authorship\n- Care work\n\t- Work of looking after the physical, psychological, emotional and developmental needs of one or more other people.\n- [Game Streamers‚Äô Practices on Twitch and Management of Well-Being](https://joctec.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Yuetal2021-A.pdf)\n- [Feeling for an Audience: The Gendered Emotional Labor of Video Game Live Streaming](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.14361/dcs-2019-0206/html?lang=en)\n- [The Affective Labour and Performance of Live Streaming on Twitch](https://www.jamiewoodcock.net/blog/the-affective-labour-and-performance-of-live-streaming-on-twitch/)\n\t- A primary element of streamers‚Äô labor is¬†_performance_, much of it invisible and ‚Äì until and unless a broadcaster becomes highly successful ‚Äì unpaid.\n- Geographies of care work\n- https://pop.inquirer.net/118188/the-screen-and-her-how-streams-became-a-source-for-community\n- [User-generated content, free labour and the cultural industries](http://www.ephemerajournal.org/contribution/user-generated-content-free-labour-and-cultural-industries)\n- ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs No Way That You Get Paid to Do the Arts‚Äù: Unpaid Labour Across the Cultural and Creative Life Course\n- https://womenscenterforcreativework.com/unpaid-labor/\n\t- We demand recognition as the creators of culture.

Therefore, if you are to engage in the Hows and Whats of teaching, it would be best to first ask this fundamental question: ==Why teach?==\n\n1. **Why is it that you are considering to become a teacher? What is your \"Why story\"?**\n2. **What do you think has influenced your desire to teach?**\n\n#### Labeling our Whys\n![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20220829144244.png]]\n\n\u003e \"**Extrinsic motives**¬†involve aspects¬†**not inherent in the immediate work**, such as salary, status, and working conditions.¬†**Intrinsic motives encompass inherent aspects**, relating to the¬†**meaning of teaching and the passion for teaching**, subject knowledge and expertise.¬†**Altruistic motives**¬†entail¬†**perceptions of teaching as a valuable**¬†and important profession and the desires to support children‚Äôs development and to¬†**make a difference in society**. \" (Bergmark, Landstrom, Manderstedt and Palo, 2018).\n\n**Which type of motivation do you think contributes most to effective teaching?**¬†Spoiler alert: The short answer is not one particular one.\n- What we know from research is that teachers from developing countries often become teachers for more Intrinsic and Altruistic reasons - maybe because they see teaching as a way to uplift the social conditions of citizens of their country.\n- However, research also tells us that often students who join the profession for intrinsic or altruistic reasons leave the teaching profession because of a mismatch with their perception to reality.\n- So, if there isn't one particular best motivation, why does it matter to know yours? or even consider it? Despite the fact that motivation is not necessarily a predictor of effective teaching, ==why you choose to teach often means you have a certain perception about your role as a teacher - and this perception often influences your everyday decisions.==\n\n##### Perceived Roles/Motivation of Teachers\n- **Recreating the Caring School**\n\t- Teacher as role model, guide, helper\n\t- Motivations:\n\t\t- Shaped by positive experience = they want to recreate\n\t\t- Shaped by negative experience = they want to correct\n- **Creating a Desirable (Professional) Life**\n\t- Teacher as a professional\n\t- Motivations:\n\t\t- Job security (v.s. other professions)\n\t\t- Self-development\n\t\t- Influence of the future\n- **Fostering the Upright Human Being**\n\t- Teacher as a reformer\n\t- Motivation:\n\t\t- Making a difference for persons and for society\n- **Forming Valuable Knowledge**\n\t- Teacher as an expert (academic/educationalist/with special knowledge)\n\t- Motivations:\n\t\t- Usefulness of Knowledge\n\t\t- Passion for the subject\n\n**Extra Resources:**\n- [**The Story of the Filipino: Teach for the Philippines**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SppdQHZ-4A)\n- [**EXPLORING TEACHERS‚Äô WHYS: Understanding Motivation Among Teachers in the Philippines**](https://www.seameo-innotech.org/portfolio_page/exploring-teachers-whys-understanding-motivation-among-teachers-in-the-philippines-2/)\n\n\n#### Other \"Teacher Factors\"\n##### \"Teacher Factors\"\n![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20220829151128.png]]\n\n1. **Gender**\n\t1. According to research, male teachers are often more dominant, authoritarian (Dunkin, 1987; Winer, 1995 in Cruickshank, et al, 2009) and use more aggressive discipline toward boys (Rodriguez, 2002 in Cruickshank, et al, 2009).\n\t2. While, female teachers more often maintain \"warmer\", more nurturing classrooms (Dunkin, 1987; Winer, 1995 in Cruickshank, et al, 2009).\n\t3. However, despite these differences cited, others also report that neither teacher gender, race or ethnicity seem to affect how much students actually learn (Ehrenberg, Goldhaber \u0026 Brewer, 1995 in Cruickshank, et al, 2009).\n\t4. All this research shows that impressions on teachers based on gender still does exist.¬†_As a learner, do you recognize this? Do you find yourself feeling differently about your teachers, depending on their gender?_\n2. **Age**\n\t1. According to studies, there seems to be difference between novice and experienced teachers in terms of how they approach their work and their ability to adjust in teaching. \n\t2. For example, new teachers are more open to trying things (Barnes, 1987¬†in Cruickshank, et al, 2009) yet tend to be more controlling (Fuller and Bown, 1975 in Cruickshank, et al, 2009). \n\t3. While, more experienced teachers, though not as open to change, are able to adjust their teaching well and be flexible to the needs of the students and learning context (Ainley \u0026 Luntley, 2004 in Cruickshank, et al, 2009).¬†\n\t4. _As a learner, when you compare younger to senior teachers, do you experience the same?_\n3. **Personality**\n\t1. In a research of Zamorski \u0026 Haydn in 2002, students aged 11-15 reported that they thought that these characteristics were most important (here are the top 5):]\n\t\t1. Interacts 'normally' (63%)\n\t\t2. Friendly (63%)\n\t\t3. Enthusiastic (54.3%)\n\t\t4. Sense of Humor (52.2%)\n\t\t5. Lets pupils talk as they work (50%)\n\t2. When we know our \"default\" natural tendency, we know if there is a need to move out of our comfort zone when it is called for.\n\t3. _How about you, what would be your \"default\" personality? What are adjustments that you think you might need to make in some teaching contexts?_\n4. **Beliefs**\n\t1. Sometimes, without us knowing it, we bring these paradigms when we teach, and whether they are true or not, according to research, teachers often act on them (Fang 1996 in Cruickshank, et al, 2009).\n\t2. There are many things that might influence your belief, such as how you were brought up, or the kind of education that you yourself experienced as a learner.\n\t3. Teacher's example:\n\t\t1. When I was starting out as a teacher, I remember telling myself that I didn't want to be like those teachers who spend so much time with their students - I believed that that was not my role - I am not there to be their friend, I am there to teach them something! \n\t\t2. However, after years of teaching, I realized that ==relationships are a prerequisite for successful teaching and learning!== I realized that in classes when I was able to name each student, and where I exerted extra effort to know each one, those were the classes where my students were most engaged.\n\t4. What is important is for teachers to be aware of them, so that they can be aware of situations where they make decisions based on them, even if they are unfounded.\n\t5. _What are your current biases and beliefs? How do you think might they affect your teaching? (the effect isn't always negative)_\n\nApart from personal characteristics, Cruishank, et al also asserts that Experience and Preparation in Education also greatly affects ones teaching.\n\n![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20220829153411.png]]\n\n5. **Our Teaching and Learning Preferences**\n\t1. These preferences are often greatly influenced by experiences in the past where you enjoyed being taught.\n\t2. Your preference may be different from what is needed in the learning context and by your learners, so, again, I think what is most helpful is to know your bias- and to know when it's okay or not okay to follow it.¬†\n\t3. _What is your \"biased\" learning preference?_\n6. **Know that whats and hows of teaching**\n\t1. . Although a lot of things are searchable online right now, and arguably, you can learn anything from google and/or youtube, expertise is still an important part of teaching - both the expertise in a subject matter and expertise and experience in actually teaching it.\n\t2. Unfortunately, you can't fake expertise! Your students will know if you \"know your stuff\". \n\t3. One way to appreciate this is to think about this question: Try to compare explaining something to someone about something you are familiar with vs. something that is entirely new to you.\n\t4. _If you are to be a teacher in the future, what subject would you want to teach? How much do you know so far about the Whats and Hows of teaching that subject?_\n\nWe cannot separate the teacher from the teaching because...\n\u003e **\"We teach who we are\" (Parker Palmer)**\n\nThis doesn't mean we should change who we are, but if we are to be teachers, we must be aware of how much who we are actually affects our teaching. For example, since I became a parent, I found myself to be warmer to my students - and also eventually liking the kind of teacher I am now.¬†_So, who is it that you will bring to your teaching?_\n\n\n#### Your favorite teacher\nRecall a teacher who you think was very effective.¬†(Answer each question with a maximum of 5 sentences)\n1. What made you say that he/she was effective? (again, no need to name them, but you can situate where you encountered this teacher)\n2. What did this teacher \"bring\" to the teaching experience?\n3. What do you think were the factors that contributed to his/her effectivity?\n\n\nWhen I think about effective teaching, I can't help but think about one of my dance coaches: Coach Reflex. I've been fortunate to learn from him in multiple ways: taking his P.E. Streetdance class, getting his guidance in the Company of Ateneo Dancers, and going through his personal mentorship program. \n\nI see him as an effective teacher because of how much intention he puts into his teaching. Whenever he teaches, he always makes sure to explain why certain things need to be done; for instance: whenever he facilitates warm-up and conditioning, he explains how the exercises help you become a better dancer, such as avoiding injury. He also adapts his teaching based on the students' background; for example: when I was personally learning breaking from him, he gave me feedback and drills that helped me \"unlearn\" the form I've acquired from years of ballet + contemporary.\n\nHe brings to the teaching experience tons of expertise. He's already proved that he's a great dancer, haivng years of experience competing in various battles. However, good dancers don't necessarily make good teachers, and I believe he's also proven that he's qualified to teach. I see this in how he's constantly taking up initiatives to develop himself as an educator, such as the [Leadership Tools for the Dance Leader](https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/18039387652255529/) program and the Adaptive Design for Learning course.\n\nThe main factors that I believe contributed to his effectivity are his personality, preferences, and beliefs; I'll show how these all work together with an example dear to my heart. A few days after the release of election results, I ranted on Facebook about how useless I felt my college education was, considering that many figures in our government aren't qualified to hold positions of power (it didn't help that most of my family voted for these said figures); when he saw this, he reached out to me to share his personal views. He believes education is valuable because it equip yourself with the tools you need to better yourself and your community regardless of your profession; to him, this impact matters more than letter grades (which is why he isn't fixated on them). He works to uphold the value of dance because of its societal impact (i.e. it pushes narratives, and inspires people in so many ways); thus, he \"pays it forward\" by teaching dance to others, digging deeply into his students. In a nutshell: his approachability, understanding, and passion are what makes him such an effecive teacher to me.\n\n#### Key ideas about teacher factors\n**1. The why of teaching inevitably affects the hows and the whats.**\n_Why a teacher teachers and how they perceive their roles as teachers can affect how they approach the teaching process. Thus, it is important for current and future teachers to be aware of their whys._\n\n**2. Teachers cannot be separated from the teaching.**\n_Your background, your personality, your character, etc. is something that you will inevitably bring to your teaching. What matters is to be aware about how these might help or hurt._\n","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.727605418Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2022-09-05":{"title":"2022-09-05","content":"## Topic Proposal\n#thesis\n### Guidelines\n-   The proposed¬†**title**¬†of your paper/project\n-   The¬†**type of output**: research, applied research, or creative project\n-   Your¬†**topic**¬†(This is not yet the thesis.

Expounding on this, writer Boo Chanco states: \"[Filipinos] don't have a collective national dream...we don't even have a sense of nationhood...we are very individualistic, focused on family and friends, and at best a collection of regional tribes pretending to be a nation.\" Without imagination, there is no innovation; a country with citizens who can‚Äôt dream will forever be trapped in a status quo ‚Äî one embedded with oppressive systems (e.g. capitalism, colonization, patriarchy). So how can we encourage Filipinos to dream big?\n\t- I've found inspiration in Afrofuturism, a cultural movement that envisions the future through the experience and perspective of African diasporic communities. Having been manifested in various mediums (i.e. literature, music, fashion, etc.), this movement has served as a framework for empowerment and liberation for Black people over the globe; imagining better  ‚Äî and therefore just ‚Äî futures is what empowers them to resist the systems that oppress them until today (e.g. white supremacy). I believe Filipinos, with our centuries-long past of colonization, would benefit from this kind of ideology. What would Filipino Futurism look like? That's what I aim to answer with this thesis.\n\t- The final product would be a virtual exhibition consisting of curated materials that represent Filipino Futurism: artworks, music, articles, etc. These materials must fall under set themes that define this aesthetic; in order to make them understandable to visitors, these themes would be expounded on through a series of long-form essays. Visitors can also contribute their own materials to this exhibition. Basically, this website would act like a glorified Pinterest/Are.na board. I also plan to have an Instagram for promoting this project.\n\t- I see this attempt to define a new aesthetic as an act of collective worldbuilding. I believe Filipinos are fully capable of this, having seen our inclination towards decentralized storytelling; just look at movements like ManilaEncounters, RP612fic, and heck, even the International State College of the Philippines. Why do we constantly seek worldbuilding? Perhaps because the society we live in is so broken; thus, we're always trying to reimagine a better world. So why not work towards creating a \"collective national dream\"?\n- Conceptual underpinnings:\n\t- INFORMATION DESIGN: aesthetics, UX/UI design, \n\t- COMPUTER SCIENCE: futurism (technological aspect), web development, database design\n\n### Notes Dump\n\u003e This workshop will harness the power of collaborative imagination in our feminist communities by envisioning a distant feminist future. World building is a design-thinking tool which is used often to create sci-fi, fiction, and fantasy narratives in film, video games, and literature.  \nFirst we use design thinking activities to facilitate creative visualization and begin to define the rules of our imagined world. Then we will use hands-on construction of various artifacts from our created world and the stories that have captivated our attention.  \nWhat do shoes look like in our feminist future? How about currency? The creation of tangible artifacts brings the details of our created world to life.","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.727605418Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2022-09-06":{"title":"2022-09-06","content":"## Principles and Methods of Teaching\n#education #teaching #EDUC130\n### About Learners\n#### On being a learner\n\u003e One of the best ways to put yourself in the disposition to reflect on what your future learners might bring, is to reflect on your own experience as a learner first. Let's not look too far into the past. In this short exercise, i'd like you to share about your current experiences as an online distance learner, in this time of the pandemic.\n\u003e Based on your experience of this shift to online learning, what are some realizations you've had about yourself as a learner? What are situations/personal characteristics that have affected your readiness and capacity to learn? Give 1 concrete example of this from the past year.\n\n#### Considering diversity\n- Do we design our teaching based on sameness or diversity?\n- When you teach, and aim to teach well, one key consideration is to ==understand who your learners are== and what this means in terms of ==their readiness and capacity to learn.==\n- _What are characteristics that often affect a students' ability to learn? What are things that we might consider in preparing to teach learners?_\n\n##### Diversity of Learners lecture\n- Diversity in the **Context** of Learners\n\t- Family\n\t- Socio-economic Status\n\t\t- \"experiences\" outside school\n\t\t- E.G. most public school students haven't gone to museums\n\t- Sexual Preference\n\t- Developmental Differences\n\t\t- high school v.s. college student brains\n\t\t- [How Youth Learn: Ned's GR8 8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_BskcXTqpM)\n\t- Aptitudes\n\t- Interest\n\t- Personality/Temperament\n\t\t- Ways of thinking, behaving, \u0026 reacting (e.g. mood, activity, distractability, etc.)\n\t\t- Self-discipline\n\t- Gender\n\t- Learning Styles\n\t- Culture: \n\t\t- West v.s. East - how they perceive authority (see Yang Liu infographics)\n- Go from teaching a **class** to ==teaching **people**==\n\n#### Considering \"Priors\"\n- Apart from learners' inherent characteristics and current background. Another important consideration is a learner's prior knowledge and experience. \n- What a learner already knows and have previously experienced very much affects their readiness to learn new skills or concepts.\n- The subjects that we find most difficult to learn are those that are new or unfamiliar to us. To skirt around this issue, teachers use relatable stories and analogies.\n\t- E.G. Plato's Allegory of the Cave\n- https://www.aft.org/periodical/american-educator/spring-2006/how-knowledge-helps\n\n\u003e Here's a teaching challenge for you!\n\u003e \n\u003e 1. Think about a concept or skill that you would want to teach about in the future. It could be any topic.\n\u003e 2. Identify the specific group of students who you envision to be your learners(college students, kinder students, teenagers).\n\u003e 3. Then, think about a prior knowledge or experience that you can connect to it to help your students grasp the skill/concept easier. (Prior doesn't always mean past - it could mean the present to - something they are currently experiencing. Ex. Most of your courses have probably been making connections with the pandemic).¬†\n\u003e 4. **Share your answers below. Keep your answer to a maximum of 5 sentences.**\n\n\n- Skill I want to teach: Basic fitness, specifically the 6 essential functional movements (i.e. squat, lunge, hinge, push, pull, and carry)\n- Specific group: college students\n- Prior knowledge: cues based on experiences they are all capable of imagining (e.g. bracing your core = imagine being punched in the gut)\n\nIn the future, I want to teach basic fitness, specifically the six foundational movement patterns: squat, lunge, hinge, push, pull, and carry; I envision my learners to be college students (think P.E. instructor vibes). I'm aware that many students start college with 0 fitness experience, which may make it difficult for them to understand cues for correcting their form. In order for them to fully understand these cues, I'd compare them to sensations they are capable of imagining, even if they haven't experienced them. For example: if I'm teaching my students how to brace their core while they do these movements, I'd tell them to imagine being punched in the gut; I believe that anyone can imagine this because of the natural reactive responses we all have. If there are still some students who have difficulties understanding this cue, I'd make them do exercises to help them learn this (e.g. deadbugs).\n\n#### Key ideas about learner factors\n1. **Aim to teach learners not just students.**\n\t1. It's quite intentional that in the module I tried to consistently refer to students as learners - this is because sometimes we have the notion that being \"students\" can be a passive role - to just attend class.\n\t2. However, when we remind ourselves that our students' roles are to be \"learners\", it reminds us of their active role in the teaching and learning process.\n\t3. This means that in as much as you contribute to teaching, learners also contribute greatly to the learning.\n2. **Teach for equity, not just equality.**\n\t1. In planning your teaching, hopefully you do not just plan to teach all your learners, but every learner - to consider not just what is the same among your students, but your learner's individual differences as well.\n3. **It's about empathy.**\n\t1. Since the goal of teaching is to facilitate learning, teachers need to be able to empathize with students - to see things from their perspective. \n\t2. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYMyqiLVcPs\u0026feature=emb_title\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.727605418Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2022-09-12":{"title":"2022-09-12","content":"## Thesis\n#thesis\n### Advisor Notes\n#### 9/12/22\n##### Feedback\n1.

This was definitely enlightening for me. \n![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20220913101258.png]]\n\n### Culture ingested\n\u003e In understanding Philippine design, it is important to familiarize yourself with the idea of ==cultural hybridity (mestizaje)==. We are a very culturally diverse nation, and had endured several colonial regimes. This has a significant impact on the subjectivity that we form, both as individuals and as a people. In this module, we look at a creative field that is rich but also often overlooked: gastronomy.\n\n*To read: Doreen Fernandez, ‚ÄúCulture Ingested: Notes on the Indigenization of Food‚Äù*\n\n\u003e Whether on your own, or in your family or circle of friends, have you observed any particular food-related quirks or traditions which makes you feel at home? Think about it (or ask around a bit): how did this start and what conditions gave rise to it?\n\nTradition: I noticed that most of the women in my family (both sides) go overboard when it comes to feeding me and my siblings at home. My mom constantly overorders food whenever we go out, even in spite of complaints (because she's a careless spender). My tita always buys way too much snacks (e.g. chips and chocolates) whenever she goes grocery shopping, despite my requests to tone it down (it amazes me how she's a doctor yet advocates for so much processed foods). My lola frequently sends homemade delicacies to our house, my favorite of hers being strawberries and cream. To be honest, I've hated (and perhaps still hate) how obsessed all of them seemed to be with food; as someone trying to lose weight, I thought that these traditions were detrimental to me. I couldn't help thinking: \"Why are they always trying to sabotage my progress?\"\n\nOf course, I know they mean well. Now, I understand that gift-giving is one of their main love languages, and they show this through enthusiastically feeding me and my siblings. Reflecting on their lives, I can assume that this came to be because of how they grew up. My lola came from a life of poverty, where her next meal wasn't always guaranteed. My aunt's parents' managed and grew a popular restaurant, so she grew up valuing food (after all, it physically and financially sustained her family). My mom had distant parents: her mother was the neglectful type, while her father was oceans away, working as an OFW; despite the physical distance, he made up for it through constant providing, whether it be tuition or balikbayan boxes (much of which was filled with treats). Despite the differences in their upbringings, they all ended up appreciating food.

These artifacts can also be sorted and filtered through thanks to having tags like: type/format, date of release, and present characteristics (from concrete design elements/styles like maximalism to abstract thematic concepts). This archive will also come with a form that will allow anyone to contribute to it. \n- A glossary section that explains and expounds on the aforementioned characteristics. Each item here will also come with its own page, where one can learn about its defintion, history, related terms \u0026 theories, and example artifacts (which will come from the archive). \n- An editorial section consisting of a series of articles that aim to dissect how local memes reflect aspects of Filipino culture, from the values we've grown up with to the current state of our politics. These articles will allow viewers to understand the significant role of digital folklore in our lives.\n- Facebook and Instagram accounts that will be used as the archive's promotional platforms.

In online learning, it's not easy to just \"wing it\" (you know, those teachers who can just get by with their often entertaining personality and presence). \n\t- In online learning, \"learning\" - rightly so, is put to forefront. \n- Therefore, teachers, the polymorphous bunch that we are, need to evolve, not just to be performers and facilitators in front of students, but to be ==designers and guides== as well - both requiring one crucial activity: planning.\n- We will reflect broadly about how teachers plan - and we will zoom into the paradigm we will use for this course called backward design.\n\n#### Planning forward\n##### Activity\nA.¬†**Imagine that you are planning to teach**¬†any¬†of the following to a¬†grade school student.¬†\n\n‚åõ¬†**In 3 minutes**¬†(ideally setup a timer and don‚Äôt go beyond 3 minutes), ‚Äúplan‚Äù to teach about this (no need to do any research on how to do it-just go ahead and do what you think would be right). Jot down notes or questions in a sheet of paper or in a digital notebook.\n\n**Ready?**¬†Start when you are, then continue to read on to reflect on your experience.\n\n**B. Look at your plan with notes and questions.**¬†Take note of the following (you can mark them with 1, 2, and 3)\n\n1.) Notes/questions about¬†**what to teach about this**¬†(topics, facts, etc)\n\n2.) Notes/questions about¬†**how to teach this**¬†(activities, strategies, etc)\n\n3.) Notes/questions about¬†**why teach this**¬†(Application of this topic in real life, when will students use this, etc.)\n\nDo you have more of 1, 2 or 3?\n\n##### Reflection\n- When we plan to teach, there is often a tendency to focus on # 1 and/or #2. \n- Teachers, who are often experts in a certain discipline, would often jump into planning the content (what) and those who have trained to be teachers, the strategies (how). \n- This results to a \"teaching model\" that is commonly known as ==\"teach, then test\"== - teach the content, then¬†come up with a test to check if students have learned it.\n\n\u003e Is this an ideal way of planning? Why? or why not? (After all, the considerations of # 1(topics) and #2(activities/strategies) really make up most of what we do as teachers, aren't they?)¬†What do you think? What do you think is the advantage and/or disadvantage of this way of planning?\n\n#### Planning backwards\n**Moving beyond teach, then test.**\n-  If you didn't see anything wrong with the planning to \"teach, then test\" model then you are not alone. This is still a prevalent planning model in the profession.¬†\n- However, doing so sometimes leaves effective learning to chance because this type of planning ==leaves out a key player in the teaching process-the learner! ==\n- There is much wisdom in Hirst‚Äôs assertion that¬†**it is the learner that does the learning**¬†after all! ¬†This means that if we want to effectively teach, we have to first begin with the learner-or in other words, to ask questions about # 3. \n- Why should learners learn ‚Äúthis‚Äù? Think about it. Technically, you can plan out topics and activities (most specially if you just plan to present the content) without considering the learners at all!¬†\n- But, why can this be a challenge? ==If in the first place, why learners need to learn what you want them to learn is unclear, they will not naturally want to learn. ==\n- One way to understand this is to look back at our \"informal\" learning experiences (things we learned outside school) - remember some of the first few things you learned as a human being - how to walk, how to talk, etc. There was no curriculum that asked you to learn it - you learned these things because of something you yourself wanted to do (to walk, to talk and communicate with others, etc). \n\nThis leads us to consider an alternative way of planning called **backward design.** So, what is backward design? [Here's a short video to introduce you to the concept](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xzi2cm9WTg).\n\n![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20220915233553.png]]\n- ‚ÄúBackward Design‚Äù (See Figure 1.1), first introduced by Ralph Tyler in 1948 and popularly adapted by Wiggins and McTighe (proponents of the Understanding by Design Framework), reverses how you typically plan for your teaching. In more \"traditional\" teaching, planning begins with # 3 (teach-learning experiences and instruction), then # 2 (test-find evidence of learning).\n- While in backward design, you begin with the desired results and acceptable evidence first, BEFORE planning activities and strategies to be part of instruction. In the anecdote above, it is beginning by \"planning the destination\". Put in another way, this means that in this model, we begin with \"Why learners need to learn this?\" (desired results) first. This is very much aligned with Hirst's definition of teaching, where the objective of any teaching is for learners to learn \"x\" - if we clearly determine what \"x\" is, then whatever \"teaching\" we end up doing will be designed to gravitate towards it.\n- [Get a deeper overview of the process through this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbKx_tG99ho)\n- [Read more about backwards design in this whitepaper](https://files.ascd.org/staticfiles/ascd/pdf/siteASCD/publications/UbD_WhitePaper0312.pdf)\n\n\u003e 1. How do you think will planning backwards affect teaching and learning? Think about the subject area that you want to teach in the future - of you were to plan backwards, what do you think does this entail? What will be easy to do? What do you think will be challenging?\n\u003e 2. Recall your experiences as a learner - can you give an example where if the teacher planned backwards, it could have potentially made your experience as a learner better?\n\nBackwards planning makes teaching and learning more intentional, which in turn increases effectiveness. This is because it considers the learner's needs in the design of their educational experience, which makes them more inclined to engaging in it.\n\nI want to teach a movement practice in the future, whether it be a dance style or basic fitness. Planning backwards would entail for me the following: determining what successful learning outcomes look like (could be concrete, such as memorizing cetain vocabulary moves, or more abstract, like learning the value of discipline) and adapting my teachings to my students' needs (e.g. background experience, learning disabilities). The former would be easy for me thanks to years of experience (which allows me to be certain about what needs to be learned), while the latter would be difficult for me because it would require a lot of effort to get to know my students (since each one is unique).\n\nReflecting on my experiences as learner makes me think of my old dance studio, where I was a part of the elite team. The artistic director introduced a cross-training class into our training program, and I was really excited to try this. However, after a few sessions, I ended up feeling really disappointed; class sessions were only a hour long (while dance classes usually last from 90 minutes to 2 hours), and whenever I was following the exercises, I felt like I was just going through the motions, not knowing how they'd help me as a dancer. The class didn't feel effective to me at all, and it didn't seem worth the extra cost.\n\nI would've had a better learning experience if the teacher planned backwards. She could've done this by determining the students' goals and needs (because each dancer has a unique body and mind), creating our exercise program based on these, then making the objectives of this program explicit to us. For instance, she could've introduced back strengthening exercises as a way to increase the height of our *arabesques*; along with this, she also could've provided regressions and progressions of this exercise, so that students can adapt based on their back flexibility.\n\n#### Key ideas about backward design\n**1. Teach well by design, not by accident.**\n_Planning is an essential part of the teaching process. Think of it as the \"behind the scenes\" of teaching, or the rolling credits at the end of watching a great movie. Effective teachers plan well, they don't just \"show up\"._\n\n**2. Begin with the end in mind.**¬†\n_If you are familiar with this catchphrase popularized by Stephen Covey, this is really what backward design is. Being clear with what you desire for your learners is an essential first step for any good teaching and effective learning. Put another way, ask first: What is this for? What is the desired result?_\n","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.727605418Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2022-09-16":{"title":"2022-09-16","content":"## Philippine Design\n#design #culture #Filipino \n\n\u003e Each of the abovementioned living cultures manifests itself in design.

These have always been a staple Filipino accessory, advocated by everyone from trendy Instagram jewelry shops to paraphernalia vendors outside churches. I believe that the longstanding influence of these medals shows the scale of our devotion. A notable example I can think of is Hidilyn Diaz, who proudly wore a Miraculous Medal during her Olympic Gold win.\n-   **Kultura ng Pananahan** (Devotion to the Home and Family)\n\t- I see *Kultura ng Pananahan* in *karaoke*/*videoke*. It's so prevalent in our culture that Filipinos from all social classes have encountered this machine; after all, how can a Filipino house party or family reunion is complete without singing? The *karaoke/videoke*'s cultural significance shows how much we love socializing with others; it also provides space for other exampels of popular culture, such as *senti* love songs.","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.727605418Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2022-09-21":{"title":"2022-09-21","content":"## Principles and Methods of Teaching\n#education #teaching #EDUC130 \n### Articulating Learning Objectives\n#### Guess the goals\n\u003e Before we get into the nitty gritty of what objectives are and how to write them effectively, let's begin with a quick throwback exercise. Without reviewing your syllabus documents, remember a course you have taken in the past (1st Quarter to past few years).¬†\n\u003e \n\u003e 1. Identify the course and think about what you gained/learned from the course. (it's up to you as to how you phrase this)\n\u003e 2. Then, recall what the course aimed for (the course learning objectives) - how similar or different were your gains/learnings from what was \"on paper\"/set by the course originally?\n\n#### What are objectives for?\nAccording to Borich, there are three main reasons why educators should write objectives.\n1. Translate standards into **observable** classroom accomplishments.\n\t2. Teaching challenge 1: What is a **long-term goal** for a subject you want to teach?\n\t\t1. E.G. Long-term goal: decision making to address climate change\n\t\t\t1. A grade school student may not be able to do as much as an adult. However, a learning objective you can have is articulating what this looks like in your student's setting/context. One observable classroom accomplishment: throwing trash in the proper trash bin\n2. Inform learners of what is **expected**.\n\t1. Teaching challenge 2: What is an example of an **action** or **decision** that you think you can see students make or do, related to this long-term goal?\n\t\t1. E.G. Based on the observable classroom accomplishment, we can expect grade school students to identify the various categories of trash (e.g. types of items like plastic, what not to recycle)\n3. **Inform** and **frame** instructional activities.\n\t1. Teaching challenge 3: Based on the **action/s** and or **decisions** that you would like your students to be able to make, what do they need to **know** or be able to do?\n\t2. E.G. Aside from categories of trash, students may also need to learn about the process of recycling and ecology (non-biodegradable v.s. biodegradable). Instructional activities they can do based on these are going on field trips to see recycling plants or forests; in these places, they can be toured around by guides who explain to them what conditions are like.\n\nLearning objectives lead us to...\n- Clarity\n- Transparency\n- Depth\n- Relevance\n\n#### The anatomy of an objective\nSo, how do we actually write an objective? We'll start by clarifying what it is NOT. Then, we'll break down what goes into a learning objective statement.\n**Here's a quick exercise**¬†_(try to answer the question below - just in your head).¬†**Let's say these are statements for early grades students****:**_\n![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20220921014023.png]]\n\nThe right answer is number 3 - Students will practice the multiplication tables. How is this statement different from the other two?\n\n![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20220921014107.png]]\n\nStatement 1 and 2 point to an ==\"end state\"== or what we've started to call a ==\"desired result\"==, while # 3 is just a statement that describes a learning activity. \n\nSince the sentences seem alike, you'll have to remind yourself of the litmus test - ==is it a means or an end for the target learner?== the example above was for early grades, which helps us assume that they could not do # 1 and 2 yet. \n\nHowever, if say we change the context to the upper grades (ex. Gr5-7), # 1 and 2 seem so elementary and could be learning activities that lead to a more complex objective. This leads us to the first key idea about learning objectives: ==**üîë Learning objectives should describe a desired result, not just an activity.**==\n\n##### Writing Effective Objectives\n- Let's reverse engineer this statement: **\"Students should be able to write an essay on a given topic without grammatical errors.\"** What do you think makes this a good objective?\n- Key components:\n\t- ==**Behavioral:** ==observable and measurable; identifies the **performance** and the **product**\n\t\t- E.G. \"write an essay\"\n\t- Identify the learning ==**conditions**==\n\t\t- E.G. \"on a given topic\"\n\t- Identify the ==**criterion**==\n\t\t- Criterion: set of standards you want student to achieve\n\t\t- Standards can be of a particular discipline (e.g. writing), or time?\n\t\t- There are some times when learning objectives don't identify the criterion because what teachers do in these instances is talk about the criterion in terms of **grading**\n\n##### Moore's \"Classroom Teaching Skills\"\nClarifying the difference between conditions and criterion\n![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20220921015505.png]]\n\n##### Lesson Cont.\nIn the video and excerpt above, I touched on the following key ideas:\n\n**üîë**¬†**Learning objectives should articulate the¬†==target behavior.==¬†What is the verb that describes what you want your students to be able to do after the class or course?**\n\n**üîë**¬†**Learning objectives should articulate¬†the¬†==condition and criterion.== What is the context by which you hope for learners to do the behavior? What are the standards that you want them to achieve?**\n\n\u003e Come up with 3 learning objectives for a subject area/year level that you would like to teach in in the future. In your post:\n\u003e \n\u003e 1. Identify the subject area and year level\n\u003e 2. 3 learning objectives - label the parts (behavior, condition, criterion)\n\n\n- Subject Area: Cultural Studies of Contemporary Technology (interdisciplinary elective)\n- Year Level: 4th Year College\n- 3 learning objectives:\n\t- Students should be able to demonstrate a sufficient understanding of the interactions between culture and technology *(behavior)* through closed-book *(condition)* tests consisted of short answers and essays *(criterion)* - APPLY\n\t- Utilizing critical theory *(condition)*, students should be able to analyze contemporary technologies *(behavior)* through written long-form essays *(criterion)* - ANALYZE\n\t- Students should be able to critique timely and relevant sociotechnical issues *(behavior)* rooted in the Philippine postcolonial experience  *(condition)* through creative group presentations *(criterion)* - EVALUATE\n\nCourse learning outcomes:\n- Analyze various contemporary technologies of recent times as subjects of serious inquiry and further cultural study\n- Demonstrate a deeper understanding of the diverse and profound interactions occurring  between culture and technology\n- Competently utilize critical theory in considering the intersection of their own experience and examples of contemporary technologies\n\n\n#### Making your objectives bloom\n- Apart from articulating clear aims/goals for your course, learning objectives can also be a powerful mechanism to make sure that learning is deepened in your class or course.\n- ¬†Remember our earlier discussion forum when you said that teachers who \"didn't teach\" were those who just asked you to memorize some facts? There is a reason why, as a learner, you felt this way! \n- It's probably because you were not led to deepen or apply your thinking - much of which you can plan to happen early on, by coming up with learning objectives using a common framework called \"Bloom's Taxonomy\".\n\n##### How to write learning objectives using Bloom's Taxonomy\n- created by educational psychologist Benjamin Bloom\n- Not all learning objectives are created equal. By determining the level by which a learning objective is in, we can make sure that ur learning objectives help deepen a students' understanding and ability.\n\n\n![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20220921020340.png]]\n\n**Three Types of Learning**\n1. Cognitive: mental skills (Knowledge)\n2.  Affective: growth in feelings or emotional areas (Attitude)\n3.  Psychomotor: manual or physical skills (Skills)\n\n##### Lesson Cont.\n\n\u003e 1. In the learning objectives in the previous discussion forum, did you write more lower order objectives (remember, understand, apply) or higher order objectives (analyze, evaluate, create)?\n\u003e 2. Any questions about coming up with learning objectives?\n\n#### Key ideas about learning objectives\n**1. Objectives allow you to see learning.**\n_If the objective of teaching is for students to learn something, then ==it starts with articulating what you want to see.== Of course you do have long-term goals that you might not be able to realistically see in the time you have with your students - and though it is important to think of those, you'll have to articulate how you want to see those goals at this moment - these are what objectives are._\n\n**2. Objectives allow you to set standards.**\n_Often, learning is about a change in your students' knowledge, skills and attitude - what we know from research is that ==if this change just happens in the lower order stages, it is less likely to be retained and to be actually used in real life situations in the future.== This is why we consult Bloom. :)_\n\n## PH Design\n#design #culture #Filipino \n- Pancit as culture...pancit as design\n- Design isn't just aesthetics... we have to think about its roots...\n- There are 100+ kinds of pancit!\n- We have the privilege to do research\n- Food also counts as information!

The research will engage the term ‚Äúdigital literacy‚Äù and investigate narrative structures, relevant aesthetics (forms), the medium representation) and sharing culture (remediation and following). The rules of sharing, production and consumption and the influences of platforms will become important ways to study this topic.\n- Mythologies will be explored in terms of local embeddedness, digital versatility and their global cultural contexts\n- We will be attentive to the evolution of storytelling from an oral practice, to a written one, to film and online distributed illustrations, to video. We will focus on specific story-telling forms within the online communities we‚Äôve chosen as cases, and explore the reasoning behind their expressions of narratives. The investigation of different levels of visualisation will lead us to a thick description of and theoretical insights concerning changing narratives, genres, presentation and representational styles across different digital communities, from words to memes.\n\n##### Figures\n\u003e Who speaks the loudest, and what are they speaking about?\n\n- This track focuses on the figures (i.e. individual characters, affinity groups, influencers, bloggers, trolls, states, autonomous bots) that populate the Internet and the vernacular expression through which they become heard. I\n- While the affordances and norms of global Internet culture have encouraged the proliferation of some folkloric figures, we will consider the ==hard and soft infrastructure (i.e. physical servers, content filters, protocols)== and ==soft power (i.e. diverse net cultures, paralanguages and Internet lexicon, user rituals)== that have stimulated uniquely SEA figures to emerge since the year 2000.\n- On a larger scale, this track will investigate the insidious subversive frivolity of everyday folklore to understand ==how mythology becomes established as corporate and national ideology== and, at a theoretical level, will explore the relationship between online and offline, physical and digital, living and the continuities that exist between pre- and post-Internet figures.\n\n##### Layers\n\u003e How are real and digital worlds layered?\n\n\n##### Rumour\n\u003e Is the internet post-truth?\n\n\n### The Internet in Asia through Singapore\n\u003e The Internet or, as these authors argue, Internets (plural) in Asia are composed of cables and exchanges, protocols and firewalls, regulations and other legal devices, making them subject to investment and governance strategies, as well as treaties and court cases. But they are also composed of figures, layers, stories, and rumors. These latter descriptors provide a heuristic framework of social features that, together with metaphors from folklore, provide analytic tools for understanding the diversity, conflicts, competitions, and disengagements of the patchwork of Internet development across Asia. The authors further argue that Singapore provides an exceptionally valuable comparative site from which to explore these features. The Ô¨Årst part of this article lays out some of the comparative features, and the second part turns to the four themes or heuristics of Ô¨Ågures, layers, stories, and rumors, developed through an STS research cluster at the Asia Research Institute and Tembusu College, both at the National University of Singapore.\n\n- Studies the Internets of Singapore through 4 coference themes\n- The themes are also grounded in two key arguments: that Internets are formsof life and that Internets reÔ¨Çect and¬†produce¬†narratives.\n- The use of the¬†plural noun Internets here is deliberate, corresponding to the overallargument that no single, monolithic Internet exists in Asia (or elsewhere) despite twonation-states (India and China) accounting for the majority of the regional population.\n- To think about Internets not (only) as networks, technologies, infrastructure, imag-inations, or mediums but in terms of layers, stories ,Ô¨Ågures, and rumors provides a¬†jumping-off point and¬†a set of new¬†perspectives that have developed¬†from a ground-upcollaboration of Internet-studying scholars in Singapore. These themes can coexist,can be contiguous, and are consistent with a position that there is no one Internet inAsia.\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.727605418Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2022-09-26":{"title":"2022-09-26","content":"## Philippine Design\n#design #culture #Filipino \n\n- Food to package: \n\t- Lucky Me!

Although there is much to be said and learned about assessment design, in this course, we will limit ourselves to the bare minimum and will focus on understanding the different types of assessments and how they can be more closely aligned with your learning objectives. As imagery, we will refer to assessments as \"evidences of learning\"¬†üîç, and refer to the saying\n\n![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20221002212659.png]]\n\n\u003e After all, as we learned in Hirst, learning will always be the goal of good teaching.¬†==_What are different types of evidence that we can have students produce? What are the opportunities and limitations of each type of assessment?_==\n\n#### Why assess?\n¬†When we talk about assessments in education, there are usually three main purposes: ==Diagnostic, Formative and Summative.== For the purpose of this course, we will on summative assessments, but it would be good for you to know the difference among these three.\n\n- **Reasons for assessments:**\n\t- To **gauge** students' learning context\n\t- To **promote** learning\n\t- To **evaluate** learning\n- Assessments are like pins on a map; they serve as markers that help both teachers and students know that they're actually learning\n- **Types of assessments:**\n\t- **Diagnostic:** What do you know so far? What can you do so far?\n\t- **Formative:** What have you learned so far? Are you getting it?\n\t- **Summative:** Can you use what you learned?\n\n![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20221002214039.png]]\n\n#### Designing Authentic Assessments\n##### Module\nNow that we have some sense of the purpose of coming up with assessments, let's jump right into the design process. As each step is presented below, I invite you to simulate it with the lesson you are designing.\n\n1. üéØ¬†**STEP 1: Retrieve your ==learning objectives**==¬†-¬†_What is the \"change\" you want to see?\n\t1. Well written learning objectives make it easier for you to actually come up with the assessment for it. Sometimes the objectives themselves begin to describe the actual assessment to be done. \n\t2. For example, in my media and technology course, one of my learning objectives are as follows: \"Students should be able to curate and create media¬†**(behavior)**¬†to aid in teaching a particular subject matter¬†**(condition)**, abiding by instructional design principles¬†**(criterion)**\" - in this case, the main task for my actual assessment is already my learning objective. \n\t3. If your learning objectives currently do not \"spell out\" what the assessment will be like yet, that's okay! We'll do that in STEP 2.\n2. üñºÔ∏è¬†¬†**STEP 2: Choose the ==form==**¬†-¬†_How can I \"see\" the learning objective?_¬†_What is the most appropriate evidence that students can produce in their context?_\n\t1. After reviewing your objective, the next step is to envision it being attained in the context of your learner. This is where the level of your learning objective comes into play-remember [[Cards/Blooms Taxonomy|Blooms Taxonomy]]?\n\t2. **ASSESSING HIGHER LEVEL OBJECTIVES**¬†through¬†**AUTHENTIC ASSESSMENTS**\n\t\t1. If your learning objective is stated on the higher levels (ex. analyze, evaluate, create), you will probably want to design authentic assessments. ==Authentic assessments approximate the¬†**application**¬†of the knowledge/skills you want students to attain and use in a real-life context.== When you look at the verbs under these higher order learning objectives, they describe activities that involve more complex thinking, a mix of skills and decision making. It usually involves the creation of a product, the conduct of a performance, or a set of justified decisions that students will need to make given a realistic situation/scenario.\n\t\t2. [Assessing What Matters Most: Developing Authentic Performance Tasks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zvFNR8WL3g)\n\t\t\t1. Apply and use in meaningful ways\n\t\t\t2. Teachnig is like coachnig\n\t\t\t3. Work to improve\n\t\t\t4. Teachers as coaches\n\t\t\t5. Teaching for understanding and transfer\n\t\t3. The tricky part is what we identify as \"authentic\" - and ==the answer to this cannot be removed from the context of your students.== What might be an authentic scenario for a college student might be different for a grade school student (you actually already started to think about this - remember our previous exercise where I asked you to think about the long-term goal for your subject?). \n\t\t4. One of my favorite examples to illustrate this is the [TV show Masterchef](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E86-RJe7mfA)!  What makes Masterchef authentic?\n\t\t\t1. Apart from them really doing the actual cooking, and not just participating in a quiz bee about cooking, the challenges presented call for an application of their cooking skills in realistic scenarios - and one characteristic of a realistic scenario is that it's \"Messy\" - it can be sometimes unpredictable, there is¬†no one right answer,¬†and it often involves more¬†complex decision making. These are the same ingredientes (pun intended) that make up an authentic assessment.\n\t\t\t2. Let's use another example - let's say you are teaching basic addition to a grade 1 student. It's great if students can count aloud from 1-20 and could answer a number of drills you throw at them, but wouldn't it be more authentic if they could actually use their math skills to help their parents compute the grocery, or to figure out how to save up for a toy that they want to buy?\n\t3. Authentic assessments¬†**aim for APPLICATION NOW not just APPLICATION LATER**.\n\t\t1. I remember asking a few teachers before about why we needed to learn what they were asking us to learn about, and more often than not the answer I got was \"you'll use it in the future!\" For a grade school kid, \"you'll use it it in the future\" did not sound like a compelling reason to study the subject matter - but just the same, I studied to get an A on a test, and to just forget it immediately after. Is this an experience you can relate to as well? If your answer is yes, your teacher came from an ==\"Application later\" paradigm== - they believed that students just need to \"get through school\" - anyway, they will find good use for what they have learned \"later on\". The problem with this, as the example illustrates, is ==the lack of relevance that students feel, and that more often than not, the learning that happens is just good for passing a test.==\n\t\t2. In an authentic assessment we design ways to approximate the real life applications of what you aim for them to learn. So, how do we come up with these situations. One helpful tool is called the GRASPS model.\n\t\t\t1. **G**oal ‚Äî challenge or problem\n\t\t\t2. **R**ole or Responsibility\n\t\t\t3. **A**udience\n\t\t\t4. **S**ituation or Scenario \n\t\t\t5. **P**roduct or Performance\n\t\t\t6. **S**tandards ‚Äî Expectations\n3. **Reminder:**¬†At this point, you may be thinking that authentic assessments should always be a project. The answer is: No. ==What makes it authentic is the task, not the format!== This means that a paper and pen essay could be authentic, if the situation set-up follows GRASPS.\n\t1. _Ex. In a persuasive writing class for college students, an authentic written assessment might sound like this: You have been in charge of a new national committee called the COMELEC Youth (Role). Your goal is to convince young people like you to vote wisely in the upcoming 2022 Philippine Presidential Elections (Goal). As part of your role, you have been asked to give a 20 minute speech to 1000 young leaders from all over the Philippines (Audience), in the opening convention (Situation). Write a compelling script (Product, Standards-assuming what makes something compelling has been learned in this class) for this speech._\n\n\u003e Come up with a possible authentic assessment for the learning objective you thought of in the previous exercise. If you came up with a lower order thinking objective, try to come up with a higher level one. Share about your authentic assessment idea below. In doing so:\n\u003e \n\u003e 1. Identify the subject area and year level\n\u003e 2. State the learning objective/s.\n\u003e 3. Describe the idea for an authentic assessment using GRASPS as a guide. (Here's a helpful¬†[GRASPS Model](https://jaymctighe.com/downloads/GRASPS-Design-sheets.pdf) Worksheet!)\n\u003e 4. Optional: You may want to add a picture or video clip to help us picture what you have in mind.\n\n##### Task\n###### Learning Objectives\n**Feedback from Sir. for last exercise**\n- Students should be able to demonstrate a sufficient understanding of the interactions between culture and technology¬†_(behavior)_¬†through closed-book¬†_(condition)_¬†tests consisting of short answers and essays¬†_(criterion -¬†==this still sounds like a condition==) \n\t- To develop a criterion for this, ask: What is the degree I want my students to get to in terms of the skill of demonstrating an understanding of interactions between culture and technology? What is the difference between their ability to do this behavior before and after the class?_\n-  Utilizing critical theory¬†_(condition-==actually the criterion because it describes more how you want them to be able to analyse after the class==)_, students should be able to analyze contemporary technologies¬†_(behavior)_¬†through written long-form essays¬†_(criterion-==more of a condition since it is the context/medium of the behavior==)_\n-  Students should be able to critique timely and relevant sociotechnical issues¬†_(behavior)_¬†rooted in the Philippine postcolonial experience¬†_(condition -¬†==criterion==)_¬†through creative group presentations¬†_(criterion-¬†==condition==)_\n\n\u003e _I can imagine how criterion and condition can be confusing. One way to distinguish is to say that:_\n\u003e **_Criterion is the ==\"degree, to what extent, how\"== of the behavior_**\n\u003e **_Condition is the ==\"context, situation, givens, when\"== of the behavior_**\n\n\n\u003e E.G. Asher was selected to be the prayer leader for today's teacher's day celebration. He was given a written prayer to practice reading last night. Today, he is expected to stand in front of his classmates and read the prayer confidently and with the correct pronunciation.

This study about what Dutch people think about the future and about technology shows, among other things, that they are generally positive about technology and science, but more gloomy when it comes to the future of society. People find it difficult to think about the (distant) future and spend little time reflecting on it. It is precisely the current speed and complexity of global changes that ensures a revaluation of the historical context when the world was still manageable. Another outcome is that the respondents are relatively down-to-earth. Representations of the future that are vastly different from our current state of affairs can count on little support. Dutch realism is also reflected in a long list of technologies that the respondents would rather not see developed.\n\n1 What do Dutch people think about the future in general? 2 What do Dutch people think about the possible general future courses of technology? 3 What type of futures do Dutch people desire? 4 How do Dutch people think about the possible future course of safety, robotics, digitization, and biotechnology? 5 Do the opinions of the Dutch people on the future and technology vary across sociodemographic characteristics?\n\nhttps://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0953946818807462#:~:text=By%20technological%20imaginary%2C%20I%20mean,one's%20future%20to%20be%20like.\n\u003e Here I draw on Charles Taylor‚Äôs definition of social imaginary, by which he means ‚Äòthe ways people ‚Äúimagine‚Äù their social existence, how they fit together with others, how things go on between them and their fellows, the expectations that are normally met, and the deeper normative notions and images that underlie these expectations‚Äô.[12](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0953946818807462#fn12-0953946818807462)¬†By technological imaginary, I mean the ways that technics shapes the possibility for how things fit together, how purpose and meaning shape what one imagines one‚Äôs future to be like.\n\n\nhttps://sts.hks.harvard.edu/research/platforms/imaginaries/imaginaries-faqs/\n\u003e **Q:¬† Can individuals have imaginaries?**\n\u003e A:¬† Not in the sense intended by this term. Individuals may conceive and communicate¬†[persuasive visions of the future](https://www.genome.gov/11007524), but these are not appropriately called imaginaries unless they take hold in other minds, and people start working to convert¬†[what is imagined into actuality](https://sts.hks.harvard.edu/research/platforms/imaginaries/iii.proj/imaginaries-publications/#jasanoff_kim). Individuals who lead and shape institutions or social movements may be especially effective creators of sociotechnical imaginaries.\n\n- Science fiction = sociotehchnical imaginaries...\n\nhttps://studenttheses.uu.nl/handle/20.500.12932/1259\n\u003e Modern-day democracies are investigating how to deal with long term problems that do not incentivize enough action in the present to prevent great problems in the future, like climate change. One possible solution could be that alternative, positive futures are to be collectively imagined, different from dystopian futures that can be painted by climate models or scientific predictions. Imagining these desirable futures has been proven to be difficult: some have argued that we are currently amid a crisis of the imagination. Intriguingly, cultural artefacts could aid in stimulating imaginaries of alternative futures. More specifically, science and climate fiction could be specifically suited for this purpose. The question that was therefore asked in this research is: to what extent can (science) fiction can stimulate policy makers to think of alternative futures? Ten policy makers participated in this study, who used science and climate fiction to create imaginaries of future worlds. Results revealed that most policymakers found that science and climate fiction stimulated them to think of alternative futures. However, most policymakers found that science fiction was not the most useful tool to create imaginaries for a policy setting. Recommendations are therefore made that future thinking is policy settings is stimulated, but that improvement are made for using methods to do this.\n\n- Interview\n\t- 1st part\n\t\t- describe work activities\n\t\t- Is futures thinking central to your work? any specific project?\n\t\t- How do they envision the future?\n\t- 2nd part\n\t\t- describe what science fiction they knew\n\t\t- most impactful ones were assumed to have most influence on their development\n\t\t- imagine that the two science fiction artefacts they chose were to become reality in 10 years\n\t\t- Consequently, they were asked to describe what this world would look like by making use of the Miro board.

This is why we tend to consider technology a good thing or, at least, a neutral thing.\nhttps://www.slideshare.net/JorgeMLucena/black-mirror-13-the-entire-history-of-you\n- background? or significance?\n\n\u003e we therefore ask what are the sociotechnical imaginaries of VR? How do these sociotechnical imaginaries frame the future(s) of VR? And finally, what kind of world views do these imaginaries bring about? In using sociotechnical imaginaries as a lens, we reveal how the future is framed within the market thus stymieing any real alternatives to the current ideological order of late capitalism and furthermore, how VR, as a case study of emergent technology, serves to invisibilise the power asymmetries which are required for that order.\nhttps://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0267257X.2022.2112610\n\n\n\u003e Similarly, speculative design aims to shape people's visions of possible futures and mobilize affect in order to construct alternative futures imagined by the designers. Speculative design can thus contest, create, and enact sociotechnical imaginaries [[96](https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3313831.3376515#bib96)]. Just as sociotechnical imaginaries can be used to look both to the future and the past, we can similarly use speculative design to re-orient toward the past.\n\nhttps://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3313831.3376515\n\n\u003e I spend a lot of time talking about futures. I'm a firm believer, like some of your earlier speakers, that the world essentially runs on narratives. It runs on stories, particularly stories about the future.\n\u003e At the World Economic Forum, I led the work on¬†[The Fourth Industrial Revolution](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/01/the-fourth-industrial-revolution-what-it-means-and-how-to-respond/), focusing on how emerging technologies could disrupt industries, labour markets, societies and governments, and how technology can be used to empower communities to create a human-centred future. The story about this was very consciously related to the idea of values, and credited to this idea of technology as a public good. We tried to create a¬†[socio-technological imaginary](http://sts.hks.harvard.edu/research/platforms/imaginaries/imaginaries-faqs/)¬†by articulating an entire narrative and way of talking about the subject.\n- technological narratives: https://www.unicef.org/globalinsight/stories/technology-and-power-narratives-times-uncertainty\n\n\n\u003e The imaginaries mentioned by S√∂derstr√∂m et al. refer to ‚Äústorytelling ideological constructs,‚Äù mostly used by corporations like Google (Shaw and Graham¬†[2017](https://link.springer.com.oca.rizal.library.remotexs.co/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-94-024-1202-4_23-1#ref-CR91 \"Shaw J, Graham M (2017), to convey a positive discourse of social prosperity and technological advancement.

One of the major repercussions is the ability of those citizens to produce and hack information about their own urban environment (Foth et al.¬†[2015](https://link.springer.com.oca.rizal.library.remotexs.co/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-94-024-1202-4_23-1#ref-CR36 \"Foth M, Brynskov M, Ojala T (eds) (2015) Citizen‚Äôs right to the digital city: urban interfaces, activism, and placemaking.

In other words, facilitated by the technologies present in the so-called algorithmic culture, urban residents can become city co-producers who are imagining, communicating, and shaping the city they desire.\n\nhttps://link.springer.com.oca.rizal.library.remotexs.co/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-94-024-1202-4_23-1\n\n\u003e Evocative imaginaries of the digital have been flourishing parallel with very prosaic, everyday actions of users by screens, keyboards, and other interfaces. Imaginaries definitely offer potential for cultural analysis, even if they are ever imperfect, provisional, and mutable. This chapter explains how imaginaries evoking ungraspable and enchanting dimensions of digitisation have been related to everyday practice and the mundane. It briefly outlines the concept of imaginaries in a way useful for cultural analysis and empirical studies of digitisation. The chapter introduce the concept of mundanisation, in order to explain how technological systems, at times imagined as ungraspable, enchanting, and sublime are transmuted into the commonplace while being enmeshed in people's everyday practices. Mundanisation is the process through which the ungraspable is ignored and how imaginary frontiers are overlooked. The chapter also discusses the interplay between evocation of imaginaries and mundanisation with illustrations that explains the relationship between imaginaries, mundanisation, and digitisation.\nhttps://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781315627731-4/imperfect-imaginaries-robert-willim\n\n\u003e The legitimacy of business education and its impact on society have been debated in the context of the economic and climate crises, with curricula, learning spaces and pedagogy being the main targets of criticism. Somehow, the COVID-19 pandemic has increased that pressure and added social inequalities to the debate. Thus, this paper proposes an exercise of imagining what management education and society will be like in 2050. Using speculative imagination, we narrate three imaginaries - Techno Futurist, Sustained¬†[Inequalities](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/inequality \"Learn more about Inequalities from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\")¬†and Eco-utopia - built upon the perspective of the students of a sustainability programme at an elite Brazilian business school. Throughout the construction of the imaginaries' narratives, we found dilemmas and contradictions that alert us that there is no clear path to an emancipatory future and that, unfortunately, the tendency is to reproduce neoliberal ideology and managerialism. Furthermore, the lack of diversity of teachers and students, a direct consequence of business schools‚Äô admission and funding, can hinder new imaginaries. We conclude by inviting business schools to include imagination as a critical exercise for students, so that they can organise outside of ‚Äúbusiness as usual‚Äù, open up alternative futures, and cope with the uncertainties that surround us.\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016328722001446?casa_token=FmB8gSxeCNUAAAAA:F4D-8RGgi2zKPGpILFGsWSCD4E0wX6X0qTXmnX1odPikInxuLfNe1ORCqQ74ueLak720bjD5KAfc\n\n- possible titles\n\t- Filipinofuturism\n\t- CyberPilipinas\n\t- Kawingan\n\t- Konneksyon\n\t- Pagkakakonekta\n\t- Kawingan; Kinabukasan\n","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.727605418Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2022-10-14":{"title":"2022-10-14","content":"## Thesis\n#thesis\n\u003e Critical Technocultural Discourse Analysis (CTDA) is a multimodal analytic technique for the investigation of Internet and digital phenomena, artifacts, and culture. It integrates an analysis of the technological artifact and user discourse, framed by cultural theory, to unpack semiotic and material connections between form, function, belief, and meaning of information and communication technologies (ICTs). CTDA requires the incorporation of critical theory‚Äîcritical race, feminism, queer theory, and so on‚Äîto incorporate the epistemological standpoint of underserved ICT users so as to avoid deficit-based models of underrepresented populations‚Äô technology use. This article describes in detail the formulation and execution of the technique, using the author‚Äôs research on Black Twitter as an exemplar.

The question is, do you need to have an authentic assessment every day of your class? \n- Answer: No. As previously emphasized, ==since tasks given in authentic assessments are complex, it usually entails using several knowledge and skills - this means that it takes some time for a learner to be able to successfully do it.== \n- For example, in this class, the lesson plan is an authentic assessment which I will have you work on - but as you can see in the module, I need to ask you to do some exercises first, that will lead to the building of the skills you'll need for your actual lesson plan. \n- ==These skill-building or knowledge-testing exercises are often referred to as \"traditional assessments\" (because, in terms of practice, most assessments still look like this - it is only recently that teachers have become more conscious of making sure that authentic assessments are done as well).==\n\n##### Authentic v.s. Traditional Assessments\n- As opposed to authentic assessments, traditional assessments are less \"messy\" and complex. They often have a particular right answer (or a set of right answers). This is often the case because typically, ==traditional assessments evaluate a students' capacity to do the subset skills necessary to build towards and authentic skill.==\n- For example, in a Physical Education Class, an example of a traditional assessment for basketball might be a shooting practical test - where the teacher can evaluate a player's capacity to shoot accurately, as well as their shooting form, etc. These (accuracy, form) are necessary skills that they will need for a more authentic task (ex. playing in a 3 on 3 game). \n- Although it is ideal for assessments to be authentic, ==traditional assessments still play a crucial role since they give teachers some feedback about the subset skills they want students to be able to gain== (ex. if a student cannot dribble, it will affect his/her ability to play in an actual basketball game). \n- Common types of traditional assessments include:\n\t- üìù¬†**STANDARDIZED TESTS:** These exams are taken by cohorts of students from different schools. They are often designed by an external body -ex. entrance exams, national achievement tests,etc.\n\t- **üìù**üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è**TEACHER-MADE TESTS OR ACTIVITIES:** This is the most common category - common examples are graded quizzes with various question types and exercises. Test items or tasks are often specifically designed to evaluate a students' ability to do a particular skill or comprehend a particular concept. Tests and exercises can measure a students' ability across [[Cards/Blooms Taxonomy|Blooms Taxonomy]] through carefully designing the types of questions or tasks.\n\t- [Review this article on the different question types](https://canvas.unl.edu/courses/97691/pages/traditional-assessment-types)\n\n\u003e Try to come up with a traditional assessment for your learning objective/s. It can either be an activity or a test.\n\u003e 1. Identify the year level and subject area\n\u003e 2. Share about your traditional assessment idea:\n\u003e \t- If you decide to come up with an¬†**activity**¬†-state the learning objective, describe the activity and explain what you will check or how you will gauge a students' success. Ex. I will ask students to write 3 complete sentences to introduce themselves. I will check for proper capitalization.¬†\n\u003e \t- If you decide to come up with a test - state the learning objective, give at least 2 examples of test questions (any question type) and explain how each question will help you determine what a student has learned.\n\n#### The Assessment Litmus Tests\nApart from the forms that the assessment takes and how much it aligned with your learning objectives, another key consideration in designing assessments is to ensure its validity and reliability.\n\n##### Validity \n- To put it simply,¬†**validity is the extent by which the assessment will be able to tell if a student has really met the objectives**/has learned what you wanted the students to learn. \n- For example, asking a question in a test about something that was never discussed or touched on in class invalidates that test question! When questions or tasks are given in an assessment, it should be clear that this is something you expect for them to be able to know or do, because of what they learned. This can be a common mistake in test making because the teacher is often an expert in a subject area, and might end up asking questions based on what they know not what has actually been taught. \n- Another version of this is a common mistake in coming up with authentic assessments. Have you ever been asked to post a multimedia project where the basis of your grade is the number of likes? Unless this is a class on social media marketing, this is usually an invalid way of assessing! Why? because the skill of getting people to like a post is often not connected to the actual skill being assessed in projects like this (ex. an infographic for a math class, or a video for a science class).\n- One helpful litmus test in checking for assessment validity is to ask this: **Can your students do this without having learned what you want them to learn?**¬†(ex. can they come up with a viral video without attending your math class?) - if the answer is yes, then you might be coming up with an invalid assessment. At the end of the day, the assessment should primarily¬†**provide evidence of your learning objectives.**\n\n##### Reliability\n- On the other hand, reliability is the extent by which your assessment can provide reliable results/measure what you want to measure¬†**consistently**. \n- For example, if you came up with a multimedia project (ex. make a video), will it favor those students who are more technologically and artistically inclined? Will that get in the way of objectively being able to tell if your students met the objectives? When you designed and gave a test across different sections, were the range of results different when compared? (In your assessment course, you will look into this more deeply - we won't get into this too much in this course).\n- One helpful litmus test in checking for assessment reliability is to ask this: **Are there factors in the assessment that might disadvantage other students?**¬†How can I minimize the chances that this affects their performance?\n\nIn ensuring that your assessments are valid and reliable, you are able to ensure that the data you get from your students' work truly give feedback about their learning - after all, that is really one of its main purposes.\n\n#### Key ideas about aligning assessments\n1. **Ideally, assessments provide evidence not just of knowledge and skills, but of application.** _Authentic assessments are great ways to make sure that you provide opportunities to actually try their skills now, not just later._\n2. **Assessments should always be anchored on objectives.** _What you assess and how you assess should provide evidence of your objectives being met. As a teacher, it is for you to see if students have really learned._\n\n### Designing Learning: Instruction\n#### Selecting Learning Instruction\n##### Module 3 Overview\n\u003e One of the most important factors in how interesting teachers are to their students is their use of one key behavior:¬†**instructional variety**. In a study of experienced and inexperienced teachers (Emmer, Evertson, \u0026 Anderson, 1980; Emmer \u0026 Evertson, 2016; Evertson \u0026 Emmer, 2016),¬†**experienced teachers who showed flexibility and variety in their instructional strategies were found to be more interesting, easier to listen to, and more engaging**¬†than inexperienced teachers who had no knowledge of alternative teaching strategies.\n\u003e \n\u003e **Knowledge of a variety of instructional strategies and the flexibility to change them both within and among lessons are two of the greatest assets a teacher can have**. It is unlikely that any other key behavior, however well executed, will have the same effect as variety and flexibility in capturing the interest and attention of your students.\n\u003e \n\u003e (Borich, 2017)\n\n##### Park your experiences at the door\n- As learners, we've been used to the \"receiving end\" of the teaching that happens. In the previous exercise, you probably had your own reasons for being able to say that those strategies/learning activities were effective. \n- However, although there is something to be drawn from our experiences, ==basing \"good teaching\" on experience alone is not necessarily sufficient. In fact, we are often \"limited\" by the experiences we've had.== \n- For example, if in the schools you've attended the lecture was the prevalent method of teaching, then you could bring that bias with you as a teacher - either positively (lectures are most effective) or negatively (lectures are boring and ineffective - if you haven't experienced a lot of good lectures). This bias can then get in the way of accommodating new methods and strategies - so, we must be ==\"bias conscious\".==\n- Therefore, as you go through this module, I invite you to ==\"park your experiences at the door\".== Leave them behind for a bit - we will draw from them when necessary, but I invite you to be open to listening to the experiences of other educators and research as we uncover a variety of teaching methods, even if sometimes they might challenge your own paradigms and perceptions.\n\n##### How people learn: Intending to ACE\n- Although we will not have time to delve deeply into what it takes to learn and the science behind it, I'd like to give you a brief overview of 3 things that we know from research about what teachers can do to lead to effective learning. \n- When designing learning experiences, here's one way to make sure you ACE your design (note: although we created this video with online learning in mind, the principles are very much applicable to any modality). As you watch the video begin to think of examples of how you, as a learner, may have experienced ACE in your own classes (online or otherwise).\n- [**Designing for Online Learning**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP3l628WZQo)\n- The short video above provides 3 brief tips about how to effectively design for learning, each of them, grounded on educational research and the learning sciences. In this course, we will treat them as ==principles or goals for our instructional activities== - that when we design instructional activities, no matter what specific strategy you will plan to use, we will keep these three instructional intentions in mind (clue: in the lesson plan format, you can use them to explain your instructional intention). Here are a few more things to expound on each of them.\n\n1. **üßçACTIVATE FROM CONTEXT**\n\t1. This first principle is grounded on one of the key findings we know about learning from Cognitive Science. That is - ==the role of prior knowledge and experience.== Tapping into a learner's prior knowledge and experience is an effective way to lead to learning because from a neuroscience perspective, what you are actually doing here as a teacher is ==activating your learner's neurons for you to connect to.==\n\t2. Notice how in our modules I would often begin with asking you to recall or remember a past experience? - this is the reason for it! Think about it. Imagine explaining something new to someone - it will often be easier for them to understand if you begin not with the new information, but with ==what they already know or have experienced. ==This is also why sometimes memes or pop culture references work when included in the teaching process.¬†\n\t3. **Think about the topic you have in mind for your lesson plan. What can you activate from your learners' context?**\n2. üêô¬†**CONNECT TO CONTENT**\n\t1. This second principle is, again, grounded on another key idea from Cognitive Science - that is, that ==the process of learning is \"active\" not \"passive\".== Sitting through the lecture and listening, without actively thinking about what you're hearing doesn't immediately contribute to learning! It's not like teachers pour knowledge onto a student's head! (This analogy about teaching is a common misconception). The actual \"learning\" happening in your students' head is ==an active process of a learner \"processing\" the stimulus presented and¬†**allowing that to modify their perception or actions.**==\n\t2. This means that another instructional intention, if we are to teach effectively, is to make sure that you ==create opportunities not just to present content but for students to connect to it.== This is why teachers who ask a lot of ==good questions== really get students to learn. \n\t3. E.G. I remember Philo classes with Dr. Calasanz - he would ask very simple questions like \"Paano kung walang Diyos?\", and get us to really grapple with it, even after the class period.¬†\n\t4. **Think about the topic you have in mind for your lesson plan. What can you ask students to do or think about that can get them to actively connect, and not just passively absorb your lesson?**\n3. üèÅ¬†**EVALUATE TO VALIDATE**\n\t1. Finally, this third principle is anchored on one of the findings of the learning sciences that ==\"retrieval practice\" is an essential part of the learning process.== This principle is very much aligned with a common saying that you might have heard before: \"If you don't use it, you'll lose it\". What we know about effective learning is that ==the act of remembering and using something you just learned== is actually one of the most powerful ways to really solidify what you are learning. \n\t3. For example (and feel free to try this out), one of the findings from research on this area said that when you are preparing for a test, instead of reviewing and rereading your notes, ==spend more time setting it aside and trying to explain it over and over to yourself.== According to research, the latter is a more effective way to learn. \n\t4. This means that as teachers, we should design experiences not just for students to \"acquire\" new content or skills, but several experiences to practice and apply it as well.¬† (Wait, isn't this already the assessment?! - yes, you're right, but apart from the assessment that often aims to measure what has been learned, it would help to have several opportunities to produce evidences of learning in the learning activities/in instruction, even if it is not something that will part of their grade.¬†\n\t5. **Think about the topic you have in mind for your lesson plan. What are practice activities that students can do?**\n\n- These will be the three main instructional intentions we will bring to our design of instructional activities. At the onset, you may look at them as a way to sequence your activities - starting with an activity to activate from context, then connect to content and to evaluate to validate. Yes, that's one approach, and as you will learn in the next part of this module, very much aligned to a method called \"Direct Instruction\". \n- However, ==this need not be treated linearly.== Some methods might just focus on one or two of them, and that's okay! ==What matters is your instructional intention is clear.==\n\n##### Aiming for Objectives\n\nApart from having clear instructional intentions, another consideration in choosing the right method or strategy is to look back at your goals or your learning objectives.\n\n\u003e \"Just as the carpenter, electrician, and plumber must select the proper tool for a specific task, you must select the proper instructional strategy for a specific learning outcome (Borich, 2017)\"\n\nIn the previous module, one way by which we started to categorise our goals/learning objectives is by using Bloom's Taxonomy. Wherein, the upper part of the taxonomy involved learning objectives that fell in the category \"higher order thinking\" while objectives that target the lower part of the taxonomy were those of \"lower order thinking\".\n\n###### **Higher order**¬†vs.¬†**Lower Order thinking Objectives**\n- According to Borich, one way we can distinguish these two broad categories of objectives is to say that\"\n\t- what needs to be taught to meet lower order objectives (Understand and Remember) are often¬†**\"==facts, rules and action sequences== (or what Borich refers to as Type 1 tasks)\"\n\t- while what needs to be taught to meet higher order objectives (Apply, Create, Evaluate, Analyze) are¬†**\"==concepts, patterns and relationships== (or what Borich refers to as Type 2 tasks) \".**¬†¬†\n- Let's compare these two sets of learning objectives:\n![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20221020100208.png]]\n\n\u003e 1. Based on the examples above, what do you think makes Type 1 objectives different from Type 2 objectives?¬†\n\u003e 2. How do you think will teaching Type 1 objectives be different form Type 2 objectives?\n\n###### Answer\n1. Based on the examples above, what do you think makes Type 1 objectives different from Type 2 objectives?¬†\n\nWhat makes Type 2 objectives different from Type 1 objectives is that they're attached to **context**. They're not only asking for the demonstration of a skill (as seen in Type 1 objectives, which asks for isolated demonstrations), but they're also asking for the **application** of this skill in a certain situation. In the examples provided, this can be seen in the following: using knowledge of photosynthesis in assessing places, using a lay-up shot in a basketball game, and using mindfulness of different belief systems to be a more respectful person.\n\n\n2. **How do you think will teaching Type 1 objectives be different from Type 2 objectives?**\n\nI think that teaching Type 1 objectives is more teacher-centered, meaning that it requires that the teacher must first deliver the information. Meanwhile, teaching Type 2 objectives is more student-centered, meaning that it requires that the student must be able to fully process that information; in order to do this, they must be able of connecting the learnings to their own context.\n\n##### Matching methods with objectives\n**What differentiates type 1 from type 2 objectives? What types of methods are more appropriate for each one?** Let's revisit the table from the previous activity.\n![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20221020100208.png]]\n\n-   **Type 1 objectives are often more \"simple\"**¬†\n\t- By simple, we mean it involves less steps, less prior knowledge and experience, and less complex decisions or synthesis of ideas and skills. This means that they can efficiently be taught by ==\"telling\" or \"showing\". ==\n\t- For example, in the reverse engineer an activity we did in class, skills like \"how to tie your shoelace\" is a topic we can imagine easily telling students about or demonstrating to students.¬† After all, for these types of objectives, the goal is for them to be able to repeat what you do or understand what you explain. \n\t- The same goes for the sample type 1 objectives in the table above (Borich, 2017)\n-   **Type 2 objectives are often more \"open ended\"**¬†\n\t- Since there is often a greater level of analysis and decision making in type 2 objectives, there usually isn't one clear cut \"right answer\". \n\t- For example, in the table above, using the appropriate type of shot may be different for one student or another, and greatly depends on the context of the game. \n\t- Although you can teach students strategies like using a lay-up shot when they are close to the basket, and a jumpshot when they are far from the basket, etc., them actually being able to decide on when to take the shot and what shot to take is something they cannot learn just by hearing you tell them about it. \n\t- In the same way, you can teach students grammatical rules, but them apply it accurately when explaining a concept of writing a narrative is something that is honed through practice. \n\t- Teaching Type 2 objectives often ==entail providing opportunities for students to do problem solving.== (Borich, 2017)\n\n##### Key ideas about selecting instruction\n1. **Focus on the learning first, then the teaching.**\n\t1. A part of you might be thinking: \"This is all great, but can't we just go straight to the strategies?\" - this is actually a common mistake of educators. \n\t2. Often, we get excited to think about the strategies and ways by which we want to teach our discipline (let's gamify it! --but why?) without first thinking of how these activities will contribute to student learning. \n\t3. If we want to aim for learning to happen, ==we must begin with the learning first, before the teaching.==\n2. **Use the right tool for the right purpose.**\n\t1. As mentioned in the beginning of this module, the teaching methods you will learn next will be like tools in your teaching toolbox. \n\t2. However, you must know when and how to use the right tool for the right purpose. \n\t3. Using a wrench to fasten a screw might work but might not be the most efficient or effective way to do it.\n\n#### Direct Instruction\n##### What is Direct Instruction?\nTeaching with¬†**Structure, Sequence and Scaffolding**\n![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20221020115054.png]]\n- For type 1 objectives, one of the most efficient instructional methods is called Direct Instruction.\n- Direct instruction, or what is sometimes referred to as explicit instruction, is a¬†**teacher-centered strategy**¬†in which the ==teacher is the main provider of information== (In light of our current context of online distance learning, \"teacher\" here can be replaced with software/module or LMS-more than the persona teaching, it's how students are learning in this method that differentiates it from others - where this is a more \"direct\" approach). \n- Since the goal of type 1 objectives is for ==learners to be able to do or know what a teacher is currently be able to do or understand==, then a ==direct instruction approach is often most efficient.==¬†_This module page is an example of direct instruction, since as you read through this text and watch the media I ask you to, the intention is to help you describe what direct instruction is for yourself._¬†¬†\n- One of the most common experiences we've probably had of this method, as a learner, is the ==lecture or teacher presentation==, but what is it that goes on in planning for this method that can make it an effective teaching method? One way to characterize this method is to refer to 3 key words:¬†**Structure, Sequence and Scaffolding.**¬†Let's unpack each of these characteristics.\n\n###### üñºÔ∏è¬†Structure\n- One of the key principles in using direct instruction is that it ==presumes a structured set of activities and presentation of the lesson.== The way a lesson presentation is structured in direct instruction allows several students to follow in a lesson, whether it be a straight lecture or a set of activities guided by the teacher. \n- This is probably why this approach is one of the most common methods used - since the ==ratio of teacher to students in most classrooms is probably 1:15== (teacher:student) and above. Another context that has kept this as one of the most adopted methods is time - that in a lot of formal teaching scenarios, ==teachers have to work with a limited contact time with their students== (Even in online learning, we can only assume that you will spend¬†_N_¬†number of hours on a module).¬†\n- In the direct instruction model, facts, rules, and action sequences are presented to students in the most direct way possible. At first, this usually takes a ==presentation and recitation format with explanations, examples, and opportunities for practice and feedback provided by the teacher.==\n- [Watch this short video to see what a typical direct instruction structure looks like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJJkkUPC_yM)\n\n###### üñºÔ∏è¬†Structure\n- The video above presented a sample structure that is common to direct instruction. If you do a quick search about direct instruction lesson plans, you might feel a little overwhelmed with the variety of different ways they look like. \n- However, there are a few key common parts, despite them being called differently. For the purpose of our course, we will follow this simplified structure:\n\n1. **PREPARE**\n\t1. In this first part of the direct instruction method, you will need to prepare students to take in the new information you want them to learn. I chose the word \"prepare\" because I think that this presupposes that more often than not, in a formal education setting, a curriculum is already set for students (It's not as if every subject they take is an elective). \n\t2. Therefore, it is important to begin by ==establishing relevance==, to hopefully motivate learners to take on the new information to be presented. Typically, there are 2 things that you would like to be able to do here:\n\t\t1. **Inform the learners of the learning objectives.**\n\t\t\t1. State your objectives in a clear and understandable fashion. If you are in a physical classroom, it is often good practice to ==write down your objectives and keep them visible== on a board so you can refer back to it. \n\t\t\t2. The challenge here is that ==sometimes younger learners have different levels of reading comprehension== - one interesting strategy I saw done in the early grades is that for some teachers, they actually ask students to rewrite the learning objectives in their own words.\n\t\t2. **Activate prior knowledge and/or experience.**\n\t\t\t1. In part 1, we called this \"Activate from Context\". Here, you can ==refer to a students' related prior knowledge/experience about the topic. ==\n\t\t\t2. For example, before introducing the concept of photosynthesis, you might ask students to draw plants, or in a Philosophy of Religion Class, an instructor might simply ask \"What do you think is religion?\". Apart from the cognitive advantages of activating from context, this also allows you as a teacher to get a ==\"read of the room\" or to understand where your students are at the moment== - what do you they already know/what are their misconceptions at this point, etc.\n\t\t\t3. One common strategy, most specially in basic education is ==the use of a KWL chart==, where students fill in the blanks for K and W in the beginning of a lesson. Sometimes, in the preparation stage, teachers also try to gain students' attention through presenting something from pop culture (something that students have previously encountered).\n\n![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20221020121553.png]]\n\n2. **PRESENT**¬†AND¬†**PROCESS**\n\t1. The next phase is the \"meat\" of the lesson, wherein ==teachers present stimulus material and where new knowledge or skills are introduced.== This comes in many forms, the most common being a presentation/demonstration. \n\t2. The short video lectures i've posted in the course, and this text you are reading now are examples of this phase. Here, the instructional intention is for you to hopefully¬†not just understand the information presented, but also process it. \n\t3. A common critique of the direct instruction method is the way this phase is implemented by educators - for example, if you recall teachers who might have \"powerpointed you to death\" (who just stood in front reading from slides), this is representative of the common critique against direct instruction - ==the lack of involvement of the students== (Remember how we established in the previous module that learning is actually an active process).¬†\n\t4. For direct instruction to be effective though teachers should not just dominate the presentation - but should ==ideally involve the students in the knowledge building process.==¬†¬†So, how do we make sure that you do this effectively? Here are some tips:\n\t\t1. **Chunk your content**\n\t\t\t1. HOW MUCH LEARNING TIME: \n\t\t\t\t1. In¬†_Brain Rules,_¬†Author John Medina reminds us that ==our brains naturally look for something else to do every 10 minutes!== This means that when you hit the 10 minute mark, the temptation to lose focus becomes very real for students! \n\t\t\t\t2. One way to address this is to ==stop giving new information/demonstrating new skills after the 10 minute mark== - what often helps is to ==insert a discussion or short practice activity==, or even just an ==open forum== for students to discuss what they have gained from the past 10 minutes. (note: this is the reason why in the modules of this course, i've broken the topics down into several pages and discussion forums, rather than one very long one).\n\t\t\t2. HOW MUCH TO BE LEARNED AT A TIME:\n\t\t\t\t1. Have you noticed how most effective speakers would say something like, \"there are three things about ___?\". \n\t\t\t\t2. There is actually some science behind this! According to Dr. Barbara Oakley, ==our brain's working memory has the capacity to take on 4 new things at a time.== This means that if you are introducing something entirely new to your learners, already keep in mind that after the 4th new concept, your learners may need a break, or time to process. \n\t\t\t\t3. The operative word here is \"new\" - ==the more prior knowledge you have about something, the less it will feel \"new\" to you== (and consequently, will cause less of a cognitive load to process). \n\t\t\t\t4. Remember our earlier discussion about student diversity and how your students' socio-economic status might get in the way? Imagine how different it would be to teach students Science if you have a student who has never been to a museum vs. those who have.\n\t\t\t\t5. Sometimes the pause you insert in between \"inputs\" can be a simple \"temperature check\". A common way this is done is for teachers to ask students to bring three pieces of paper (red, yellow and green), and occasionally, students will be asked to raise a colored sheet of paper depending on how they are doing (Trivia: in zoom, the go faster and slow down prompts which participants can click serves as a good substitute of this).\n\t\t\t\t6. ![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20221020122736.png]]\n\t\t2. **Scaffolding**\n\t\t\t1. Another common educational term that can help you plan the present and process phase is the term \"scaffolding\". You might have previously learned about this in your Psych 101 class, but scaffolding, as it also appropriately refers to ==the multi-stage structure often used in construction, presupposed that knowledge and skills actually build on each other. ==\n\t\t\t2. Recognizing this, one helpful thinking tool is to think about how your target knowledge/skills could be broken down (remember our reverse engineering activity?).\n\t\t\t3. A common strategy for scaffolding is the¬†**I do, we do, you do**¬†method (although it is often used in elementary education, I think it can easily be translated to teaching older learners). [Here's a brief demonstration of this strategy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMF06TJAO4) In this example, a graphic organizer was used to help scaffold the learning process - ==graphic organizers and worksheets are helpful tools for scaffolding.== The KWL chart above can serve the same purpose.\n\t\t\t4. No matter how you present content, a good guiding principle is always to go back to the instructional intention which is for your learners to ==\"connect to content\", not just to absorb content.== This way, you will always be thinking of how you can make sure that the learning experience is not a passive but an active one.\n\n3. **PRACTICE**\n\t1. Finally, the third phase is when you \"evaluate to validate\". This is the \"you do\" part of the lesson, where ==a teacher often gives exercises for students to work on or questions to reflect on and discuss. ==\n\t2. The goal here is two fold: for ==\"retrieval practice\" ==to happen (which we know contributes cognitively), and for teachers to ==receive feedback on student learning== (after all, this is the goal, according to Hirst). \n\t3. Some critiques of this approach would often say that there is often no time left to do this in a class period. Because of this, strategies such as asking students to work on an \"exit ticket\" has been developed. These are short, quick exercises that students can do towards the end of a session. [Here's a brief demonstration about exit tickets.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWUxFSXEsC8)\n\n##### Teaching Challenge: Direct Instruction\n\u003e Here's a design challenge for you. Identify a type 1 objective for the lesson you are planning. Then, think about how you can use direct instruction to teach it. In your post below include the following:\n\u003e \n\u003e 1.) Identify the year level and topic (ex. Grade 9: Introduction to Algebra)\n\u003e 2.) Identify One (1) Type 1 objective (ex. Students should be able to define accurately what a variable is.)\n\u003e 3.) Propose a set of instructional activities for a 60 minute face to face class period using the Direct Instruction Method. Complete the three phases (Prepare, Present and Process, Practice). For each activity, also provide the estimated time.\n\n###### Answer\n**Year Level and Topic:** Cultural Studies of Contemporary Technology for 4th Year College students\n\n**Type 1 Objective:** Utilizing critical theory, students should be able to analyze contemporary technologies.\n\n**Direct Instruction Example:**\n1. PREPARE\n\t1. Present the learning objectives for the session.\n\t\t1. Learn critical theory\n\t\t2. Apply this to technology\n\t2. Prior knowledge\n2. PRESENT AND PROCESS\n\t1. Instructional Procedures\n\t2. Marxism\n\t3. Structuralism\n3. PRACTICE\n\t1. Student activity\n\n##### Key ideas about Direct Instruction\n1. **The effectivity of Direct Instruction depends on structure, sequence and scaffolding.**\n\t1. The 3 S-es that serve as the characteristics of Direct Instruction serve as its key ingredients, if it is to be used effectively.\n2. **Direct Instruction is a science and an art.**\n\t1. A common misconception of Direct Instruction is that it is rigid in structure and highly prescriptive. \n\t2. Although here in the module you were taught a structure to follow if you were to employ direct instruction, what you do within the 3 Ps (Prepare, Present and Process, Practice) still greatly depends on you! ==Your creativity (the activities you come up with) and your empathy (how much you understand the context of your students) are key ingredients to Direct Instruction success. ==\n\t3. For example, in the present and process part, you can insert some collaborative activities where students can play a more active role. Although we are encouraged to refer to what research has uncovered about good teaching and effective learning, making adjustments and contextualizing to your students is still of utmost importance.\n","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.727605418Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2022-10-21":{"title":"2022-10-21","content":"## Philippine Design\n#Filipino #design #culture \n\u003e Each of the abovementioned living cultures manifests itself in design. Think of one example each, and in a few sentences, explain to us why you chose these examples. Be more thoughtful and try to go beyond the obvious.\n- **Kultura ng Paglilining at Pangangatwiran:** Cultural Center of the Philippines\n\t- When I think of what can exemplify Kultura ng Paglilining at Pangangatwiran, the Cultural Center of the Philippines comes to mind. It describes itself as \"the premiere showcase of the arts in the Philippines\": music, dance, theater, visual arts, literary, cinematic and design. CCP provides both the space and time for art to be appreciated on its own (art for art's sake), compared to other settings, where art is always attached to a social activity. CCP is also designed to evoke off *sosyal* vibes, which gives off an air of exclusivity and elitism. I imagine this is how Illustrados must have made their other countrymen feel; because of their foreign education, I'm sure that many of them struggled to connect to the everyday Filipino. Same applies to CCP; I don't think it seems accessible to everyone.\n- **Kultura ng Pag-aaliw:** P-Pop groups\n\t- Meanwhile, for Kultura ng Pag-aaliw, I think of Pinoy Pop, or P-Pop. Similar to OPM, despite having \"Pilipino\" in its name, P-Pop is mostly Korean in form and style ‚Äî given that its inspiration is K-Pop. Many released songs tend to have a short lifespan since their aim is to be trendy and catchy. This is what leads others to perceive this kind of music as shallow. Despite this, idols in these groups have a huge influence because of being highly revered by their fans (e.g. stan accounts, fan meetings, photo cards).\n\n- CCP\n\t- \"the premiere showcase of the arts in the Philippines\"\n\t- THE place for showcasing music, dance, theater, visual arts, literary, cinematic and design \n\t- Art is conceived as an autonomous thing; the arts are cultivated as a separate human activity, provided its own space/venue and time for active, concentrated appreciation\n\t- Sosyal vibe lels\n- P-Pop\n\t- Obviously inspired by K-Pop, introduced by Koreans\n\t- Pop and mass media culture\n\t- This subculture specifically targets three groups: \n\t\t- First, teenagers and youths in the peak of physical power and energy who seek equally physical forms of expression; \n\t\t- second, yuppies or young urban professionals who are variously regarded as upscale, ambitious, materialistic, and faddish; \n\t\t- and third, businessmen who thrive in a more impersonal system of production and trade, largely operating within non-family managed corporations.\n\t- Rarely does any form of music be considered classic as these songs just become outmoded in the collective memory and are replaced by newer songs performed by younger artists. Other people perceive this subculture as shallow, and devoid of any deep meanings, considered as antithesis to classical music, film, literature, etc.\n\t- Popular entertainers, movie idols, sports heroes, and icons in many fields are revered. Their invasion in the mainstream media, which is powerful in molding the public‚Äôs percep- tion, is a powerful influence to the youth.","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.727605418Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2022-10-25":{"title":"2022-10-25","content":"## Principles and Methods of Teaching\n#education #teaching #EDUC130 \n### Designing Learning: Instruction\n#### Indirect Instruction\n![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20221025110804.png]]\n\n**Food for thought:** What does it mean to involve learners? What should teachers to do involve learners?\n\n##### What is Indirect Instruction?\n*TL;DR: Teaching¬†**Concepts**¬†by¬†**Inquiry**¬†and¬†**Problem Solving***\n\n**What is indirect instruction?**\n- As you might easily guess from its name, indirect instruction is to teach students \"indirectly\". The best way to understand this is to compare it to direct instruction. \n- In direct instruction, or what is also referred to as explicit instruction, students are taught the content in the most direct way possible - since the goal is efficiency. In teaching explicitly, the teacher's role is quite prominent - as the expert and source of information and evaluator. \n- Critiques of direct instruction would say that the problem with this approach is that it sometimes dismisses the fact that learners have the capacity to contribute and construct knowledge, not just to be passive receivers of information. \n- This paradigm is grounded in the theory of Constructivism (same as [[Cards/Constructionism]]?). Therefore, if we are to understand what indirect instruction is, it's best to begin with what constructivism is in education. [Here's a brief overview about it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xa59prZC5gA)\n\n\u003e_\"Constructivist lessons are designed and sequenced to encourage learners to ==use their own experiences to actively construct meaning that makes sense to them==, rather than to acquire understanding through exposure to a format exclusively organized by the teacher (Borich, 2016; Llewellyn, 2007; Schunk, 2011). By reflecting on their own experiences, students continually change what they believe, discard old information and accept new information, and question, explore, and assess what they know.\" (Borich, 2017)_\n\n- According to constructivism, involvement does not just mean physical activity, but ==cognitive activity== as well - acknowledging that there is much to be draw from students' prior knowledge and experience, and that they have the capacity to construct and discover meaning. \n- This opposes a typical imagery of teaching wherein a teacher pours knowledge from his or her head to a students' head (This imagery often assumes that students enter the classrooms as \"tablua rasa\" or blank slates\"). See [[Cards/Banking model of education]]\n- According to Borich, this method of teaching is best used in helping students meet¬†**Type 2 objectives (Concepts, Patterns, Relationships).**\n- To help you further grasp the concept of indirect instruction, here's a table comparing the \"traditional classroom\" with a \"constructivist classroom\"\n\n![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20221025112725.png]]\n\n###### Discussion Board\n\u003e Review the table above. Based on how the constructivist classroom is described, have you experienced constructivism/indirect instruction yourself? Share a story and identify which of the characteristics from the table were present in that experience. (It could be in a formal or informal learning scenario)\n\n\n I see constructivism in my Philippine Design class, which I'm currently taking this semester. Usually, my Information Design classes would be traditional in terms of instruction; in these classes, teachers acted as experts (of software, of theory, etc.) that disseminated knowledge to their students. However, my professor, Sir. Karl Castro designed this class to be different than the rest. Here are traits of a constructivist classroom that I found present in his class:\n\n- The curriculum emphasizes big concepts, beginning with the whole and expanding to include the parts. \n\t- Sir. names his modules after abstract concepts (e.g. rooting,  hybridity, worlding, negotiation)\n- Materials include primary sources of information and manipluative materials.\n\t- At the start of every module, Sir. introduces us to its theme by exposing us to relevant movies, documentaries, and readings. \n\t- Another way he introduces us to the theme is through interactive activities. For example: when he was teaching us about indigenization, he made us bring food to class that went through this process. \n- Learning is interactive, building on what the student already knows.\n\t- Once we're done going through his recommended materials/activities, he makes us process them through class discussions, whether they be in Canvas or Arete.\n\t- His discussion prompts would often ask us to relate our insights to our own experiences (e.g. \"Have you encountered this in your everyday life?\")\n- Assessment includes student works, observations, and points of views, as well as tests. The process is as important as the product.\n\t- Aside from class discussions, he also makes us do creative works. The assignments he'd give are out of the ordinary; for the last two modules, I had to do the following: (1) make an installation piece with my own clothes, and (2) redesign a food product in a Filipino and un-Filipino way.\n\t- Before submitting our final output, he makes us share our process on Canvas. This is done by providing personal notes, sketches, moodboards, etc.\n- Teachers have a dialogue with students, helping them construct their own knowledge.\n\t- Once our outputs are finished, they critiqued by Sir. and our other classmates.  Sir. does critique by engaging in dialogue with the students, asking questions like \"What made you choose this direction?\" and \"Have you considered ____?\".\n\t- Sir. only does direct instruction (i.e. lecturing with slides) after making us construct our own knowledge.\n\n\n##### How is Indirect Instruction done?\nIndirect instruction comes in many forms and strategies. Sometimes, an inquiry-based approach can take the place of the whole learning process for a particular lesson, while sometimes indirect instruction type of activities are done as part of a direct instruction structure (ok, I hope I didn't confuse you there). Let's take a look at a range of examples of this method in action.\n\n- [Indirect Instruction in an elementary class¬†**- whole class discussion**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6OCMBeSwJ4): Here, notice how the teacher introduces the concepts of the hundreds, tens and ones place not by directly providing examples, but by asking students to contribute their ideas.\n- [Indirect Instruction¬†in a high school class - **Jigsaw Strategy**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dvi0ZvOhZs0): Another specific strategy is called the Jigsaw strategy. As with the previous clip, you will still see the teacher greatly involved, but in the strategy, there is a clear attempt to make students active participants in knowledge construction.\n- Indirect Instruction in an elementary class -¬†**projects and questions**: One of the reasons why indirect instruction is getting more traction in the past few years is because of the availability of technology.\n\t- In this [second example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJD_IZOLfKU), instead of the teachers giving the information to students, they frame the learning process through questions and projects instead, and provides guidance along the way.\n\t- Here's [another example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAYh4nWUkU0) of inquiry-based learning, and how this type of learning shifts the classroom from teacher-guided to student-driven.\n- Indirect Instruction-¬†**Project-based learning**: One of the most popular forms of indirect instruction is called project-based learning. In this strategy, students are presented with a problem to solve or a project to do, which becomes the impetus for them to learn the science, math, etc. that is part of the curriculum.\n\t- [Here's another example.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnzCGNnU_WM)\n\t- Sometimes, indirect teaching comes in other forms, such as the use of the case study method. In higher education, this is a more common form of implementation. [Watch this short clip of how the Case Study Method is used in Harvard MBA.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7iwXvBnbIE)\n\n##### Teaching Challenge: Indirect Instruction\nNow, you might be thinking, indirect instruction is very disorganized! Well, not really. Most inquiry-based teaching actually follow a certain framework (there are many). For the purpose of trying it out in this course we will refer to this:\n![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20221025114200.png]]\nThis is a common inquiry-cycle model, where the lesson begins with Ask and cycles through the 4 other components. In the process of inquiry, students identify problems,  \nbrainstorm solutions, formulate questions, investigate problems, analyze and interpret results, discuss, reflect, make conclusions, and present results. This cycle of inquiry serves as a general model for teachers planning inquiry activities that can guide students through the inquiry process.\n\n1. **Ask**\n\t1. To promote the desire to discover, the teacher begins by raising questions and inviting students to plan the inquiry procedures and presentation of findings. The teacher initiates the inquiry process by posing the lesson topic in the form of a question and then probing, prompting, and redirecting student responses  to establish the inquiry climate. This is called the ==teacher-initiated phase.==\n\t2. When students are comfortable with the process, the teacher encourages them to raise a question of their own, to plan a procedure for answering the question, to determine how to carry out the procedure, and to decide how the results might be presented. This is called the ==student-initiated phase.== This phase is a vehicle for building student-initiated questions and student-directed procedures that bring students to an independent level of inquiry. A question or a problem is the focus at this stage, which may be redefined later in the inquiry process.\n2. **Investigate**\n\t1. After a student question is agreed on, the next step is to investigate it. At this stage of the inquiry, students are asked to recall prior knowledge or experiences related to the question and to brainstorm possible methods of investigating it by identifying resources and designing and carrying out a plan of action. Students may also redefine their question as new information unfolds. This ==information-gathering stage== is a self-motivated process that is owned by the engaged students.\n3. **Create**\n\t1. When the teacher and students have jointly determined that sufficient information has been gathered, students are asked to begin thinking critically about the relationship between the information (evidence) and their question‚Äîfor example, how the information may or may not answer the question fully or completely. Here students ==synthesize the information they have uncovered to create new knowledge==, which may be beyond their and possibly the teacher‚Äôs prior experience. They start thinking critically about the appropriateness of their question or hypothesis, redefine their question and/or construct new ones, and decide whether to gather more data.  \n\t2. Some interim product is expected at this stage, such as a chart synthesizing the information collected, an oral presentation that summarizes progress thus far, or  a list of new or redefined questions.\n4. **Discuss**\n\t1. At this stage, students discuss their findings, new ideas, and experiences with one another. Students ==share their experiences and investigations in their learning community==, which can be a collaborative group or the entire class. \n\t2. When a small-group format is used, different groups may use the inquiry process to answer different questions that may have evolved from the previous steps (i.e. Steps 2 and 3).\n\t3. The task at this stage may include comparing notes, discussing conclusions, and sharing experiences across groups.\n5. **Reflect**\n\t1. After discussion, ==students critique and communicate their results to their learning community (group or class), during which they are expected to reflect  on their newly acquired knowledge.== Methods for presenting findings are selected in consultation with the teacher. \n\t2. These methods can include a traditional written or oral report or a more extensive multimedia presentation, production, or exhibit. \n\t3. Students‚Äô tasks include reflecting on the appropriateness of their question, their methods of investigation, and the accuracy of their conclusions. These tasks encourage students, either in groups or as a class, to evaluate whether a satisfactory solution was found, whether a new question is warranted, and, if so, what the new question might be by taking inventory of what has been done and making new observations. If new questions emerge, the cycle of inquiry can start again with a new lesson.\n\n![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20221025115700.png]]\n\n###### Task\n\u003e Here's another design challenge. Using the framework above, try to design an inquiry-based activity for your lesson's topic. Since inquiry activities can be for a few minutes to several days/sessions, I will give you the freedom to determine the timeframe yourself.¬†\n\u003e 1.) Identify the year level and topic\n\u003e 2.) Identify One (1) Type 2 objective\n\u003e 3.) Propose a set of instructional activities based on the inquiry cycle.\n\n\n**Year Level and Topic:**¬† Cultural Studies of Contemporary Technology for 4th Year University Students\n\n**Type 2 Objective:**¬†Students should be able to critique timely and relevant sociotechnical issues¬†rooted in the Philippine postcolonial experience.\n\n1. Ask: Present a technology with a prompt. How would this manifest in a future Philippines?\n2. Investigate: Relate to own experiences? Make use of insights from class?\n3. Create: process journal \n4. Discuss: share their progress so far with the other students. \n5. Reflect: multimedia output\n\nWhile creating my instructional activities, I was inspired by this experimental course called [\"Imagining Futures: Speculative Design and Social Justice\"](https://english.uchicago.edu/courses/imagining-futures-speculative-design-and-social-justice).  It seeks to disrupt dominant narratives about \"the future\" by exploring alternative futures imagined by and with marginalized communities. Instead of doing just traditional essays and research papers, students also have to create¬†\"short-form, theoretically-founded, and collaborative art projects.\" These projects come from the hands-on methods of speculative design and critical making. I wanted to apply a similar approach to this class!\n\n**ASK: 1st week**\nHere, I will present an emerging technology to the class (e.g. crypto, AI, VR, etc.). Then, I will give them this prompt: \"How would this technology manifest in a future Philippines?\" To answer this, they must create a speculative scenario. This could be done in any format they desire (e.g. presentation, film, artwork with explanation, etc.). My main expectation is that it must touch on possible sociotechnical issues (i.e. will this replicate existing systems of oppression like capitalism and classism?). The class will be divided into groups in order to make this project easier for them.\n\nI'm seeing this activity as a final project for class, so I'll probably put all of the above in a Canvas page, along with other needed details (e.g. rubric). I'll also discuss the final project during a synchronous session so that they could ask questions. \n\n**INVESTIGATE: 1st - 2nd week**\nBefore they can come up with an output, the students must go through intense research. This will primarily be done through scouring secondary resources like news articles, journals, documentaries, etc. Since this is an project, I'll also encourage them to lean on their own experiences as Filipinos. If they have prior experience with the presented technology, this could inform the creation of their output.\n\nWhile they go through this process, I'll continue to provide synchronous lectures and asynchronous modules on critical theories they could make use of (e.g. Marxism, Structuralism).\n\n**CREATE: 3rd week**\nIn the middle of the month, I'll do a checkpoint in Canvas. Here, students have to post findings or experiments from their research process so far. This could be as simple as a bullet point list of sources or as complex as a slide deck of their references. No matter what format they choose, students must demonstrate their creative process and the theories they've used from class to inform this.\n\n**DISCUSS: 3rd week**\nIn this same checkpoint page, I'll also require students to reply to at least one of their classmate's posts. This must be a substantial reply. Saying \"This is nice!\" or \"This is bad!\" isn't enough; there must be constructive feedback that can be used. I'm expecting that most of my students won't have prior experience with critique. So to help them with this process, I'll provide guidelines such as the [Describe-Analyze-Interpret-Evaluate framework](https://snazlan.wordpress.com/2017/04/10/art-critism-four-levels-of-formal-analysis/).\n\n**REFLECT: 4th week**\nAt the end of the month, the groups will present to the class. Here, they must describe the future they conceived (the final scenario), and explain what led them to this (supporting research + theory). When each group is done presenting, I will give them questions or comments on their output. Students from other groups are also free to do the same. \n\n##### Key Ideas: Indirect Instruction\n**1. In Indirect Instruction, students become ==co-creators.==**\nIn Indirect Instruction, the teacher is not the sole source of expertise and information. It acknowledges that students themselves can actively participate in the knowledge and skill building process. Because of this, ==the teacher's role inevitably shifts from expert to guide.==\n\n**2. Indirect Instruction aims for higher order thinking skills.**\nInherent to indirect instruction is that students will be participating in activities that utilize ==higher order thinking skills== (ex. analyzing, evaluating, creating) - most of which often closely relate the lesson to its ==applicability in real-world scenarios.== This presupposes that you have clearly articulated learning objectives at these higher levels.\n\n#### Module 3 Exit Ticket\n1. In this module you learned two broad approaches in designing your instructional activities. Which of the two approaches do you feel more comfortable to utilize? Why?¬†\n\nPersonally, I'm more comfortable utilizing direct instruction. This is because it's the approach that I've been exposed to throughout my whole life. Whether I'd be in a school classroom or a dance studio, I'm used to receiving lessons from teachers, who I'd see as experts.\n\n2. Based on what you learned this module,¬†**what is effective teaching?**¬†(what additional insights did this module add to your definition of effective teaching?)\n\nBased on what I've learned in this module, effective teaching...\n- ...prioritizes the student's learning experience\n- ...uses the right tools for the right purpose\n- ...is structured/sequenced/scaffolded in an intentional way \n- ...enables students to actively participate in the knowledge and skill building process.\n- ...relates lessons to real-world scenarios\n\n3. Since it's the last activity of the module, please also share about your experience as a learner in Module 3. How did you find Module 3? What helped you learn? What hindered learning? (It's okay you can be honest. Your feedback will help me make necessary adjustments in the coming modules, if necessary).¬†\n\nI found the Module 3 easy to go through because of how it was broken down through design (e.g. use of lists, takeaways). Visual aids definitely helped with this! However, I have a bias towards images over videos. This is because they are faster and easier to process; as a busy student with ADHD, I struggle to pay attention to videos for an extended amount of time.\n\n4. The estimated learning time for the whole module is about 4.5 hours (about 1.5 hours per sub module). Did it take you that long? More or less? What were factors that contributed to the length of time?\n\nI believe it took me more than 4.5 hours to go through the whole module.  I think I took longer than usual because of the extra time and effort I put into the teaching challenge, because I really wanted to make it the best that it could be.","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.727605418Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2022-10-30":{"title":"2022-10-30","content":"## Thesis\n#thesis\n### Outline dump\n- Imaginary crisis\n\t- dominant narratives\n\t- individualistic cultures (prompted by survival mode)\n\n\n-   Why can‚Äôt we fully maximize innovation?

With the publication of Fausto J. Galauran‚Äôs Doktor Kuba in 1933, the Philippines actually has the oldest written Science Fiction tradition in Southeast Asia. Despite an early start, the country has had comparatively few serious Science Fiction works in any medium. This is problematic as nothing shapes the vision for a country‚Äôs future like Science Fiction does. As historian Yuval Noah Harari has said: ‚Äú_Today science fiction is the most important artistic genre. ‚ÄúIt shapes the understanding of the public on things which are likely to change our lives and society more than anything else in the coming decades_.‚Äù\n\n\u003e As scholar Dominic Cimafranca observes, Philippine science fiction may not be as popular as fantasy and horror because of the predilection of Philippine writers to highlight internal characteristics, such as those found in stories of the magical and the fantastic, as opposed to external forces, such as those found in stories about technological and scientific advances. However, Philippine science fiction is an important genre to cultivate because it imagines and shapes a future ‚Äì a future that, hopefully, improves on our present conditions.\n\n\u003e For a nation to progress, to move forward, it is first necessary to dream about where it can go (as well as the scenarios it needs to avoid). Science Fiction is fertile ground for this type of thinking and this is why it‚Äôs important for every nation to create its own body of suppositional fiction.\n\u003e \n\u003e This is particularly true for post-colonial developing nations like the Philippines. The bulk of Science Fiction comes from the United States, the UK and Japan (the latter primarily for anime and its derivatives). ==The outlook and point-of-view of such culturally dominant narratives is imposed on the rest of the world simply because it‚Äôs the only one readily available in the market.==\n\u003e \n\u003e The Philippines (and by extension the rest of the world) needs its writers to add their voices to what should be a multi-ethnic, multi-perspective chorus. Never mind that the international market prefers ‚Äúwestern-style SF‚Äù at this time. Never mind that very few Filipino writers can write without any vestige of western colonialism. The country needs more stories to define the future it wants and deserves.\n\u003e \n\u003e \"...The fundamental premise of sci-fi is not spaceships and lasers ‚Äî it‚Äôs that children can learn from the mistakes of their parents.‚Äù\n\u003e It‚Äôs about dreaming the future.\n\u003e In fact it‚Äôs time for the Filipino to dream a multiplicity of futures. ==It‚Äôs time to figure out where we want to go as a nation (because you really wouldn‚Äôt want the politicians and/or showbiz personalities to do it for you).== It‚Äôs time to create our Science Fiction.\n\n### Word Dump\nWorks commissioned by the Exploration and Future Sensing team of Omidyar Network, a social change venture investing in the creation of more inclusive and equitable societies. One of them is Portals to Beautiful Futures, their Trends to Watch report for 2021. Instead of settling for a list of trends, they partnered with the Guild of Future Architects to reimagine the report as a multifaceted series of provocations.\n\n\nCriteria must be also set for the materials that will be included in the database. First, included materials must be a criticism of technology and/or cover technology through the lens of the humanities and social sciences. Next, they must also be considered long-form, whether they come in written or video content (a minimum of 1,200 words or 30 minutes). Then, they must be published by institutions like universities, nonprofits, and publications; exceptions will be made for independently published materials, like personal blog posts, if the author is considered established in their field of study (through education and work experience). Finally, these must also be in the English language, due to the personal limitations of the researcher. Materials will be collected through mainly online methods, such as personal research and crowdsourcing on social media.\n\n**The researcher also acknowledges that the study may be skewed in terms of education and social class due to the existence of a digital divide: people who have access to technology and can fully leverage it are more likely to come from privileged backgrounds.**\n\n¬†\n¬†The more creative our imaginations are, the more capable we are of achieving better futures: ones where technology is made for us, not against us. Before we can push for better innovation, we must be able to criticize the current state of the technologies that surround us, \n\nThus, in order to make equitable technological development the standard, critical perspectives on technology must be made accessible to all. Technologists are capable of this; given that they already make the act of consumption easier and more efficient for us (e.g. one-click buying and personalization algorithms), surely it‚Äôd be possible to do the same for the act of learning¬† ‚Äî a.k.a. consuming knowledge ‚Äî as well.\n\n#### RRL\n- Designing with intention can be done by developing and following evaluation criteria, guidelines, standards, codes, and laws.\n- [Future imaginaries in the making and governing of digital technology: Multiple, contested, commodified](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1461444820929321):\n\t-   Weave into the introduction na lang\n\t-   [[Cards/Imaginaries]] are collectively held and institutionally stabilized\n\t-   Nonetheless, they are multiple, contested and commodified rather than monolithic, linear visions of future trajectories enacted by state actors.\n\t-   Imaginaries are increasingly dominated by technology companies who not only take over the imaginative power of shaping future society.\n\t- They also partly absorb public institutions‚Äô ability to govern these very futures with their rhetoric, technologies and business models.\n\t- Transition: exploring technological imaginaries made by people, whether they are users or builders\n","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.727605418Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2022-11-06":{"title":"2022-11-06","content":"## Principles and Methods of Teaching\n#education #teaching #EDUC130 \n### Facilitating Learning: Teaching with Questions\n_You will begin by exploring the whys, hows and whats of using questions for teaching._\n#### The wise old man or the conductor?\n![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20221106234657.png]]\n![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20221106234707.png]]\n\nNotice the two images above. We'll call the first one (left): \"the wise old man\"-with his arms behind him, like a supervisor inspecting goods, and his noticeably grey hair indicating age (and often with a connotation of wisdom). Then, we have the guy on the right picture. We'll call him \"The Conductor\" - portrayed looking at his orchestra, each member holding a musical instrument.¬†\n\nThese two guys are examples of ==how teachers perceive themselves.== Some perceive themselves like the wise old man, an expert and inspector, the source of wisdom and knowledge. If this teacher could choose a picture that would be posted on every starbucks, it will probably be of him talking in front of a lecture hall, with his students' eyes fixed on him. On the other hand, some teachers perceive themselves as the conductor - stepping into the classroom not just to be the source of \"music\" but to create the space for their students to \"make music\".¬†_(Ok, obviously the analogy is not perfect - the orchestra often follows a certain musical piece and does not allow the members to go astray, which sometimes prefer to happen in the classroom, but I think you get the point)._¬†If the conductor were to choose an image for the starbucks poster, it will probably feature his students playing music, not him.\n\nOf course, there is a place for both types of teachers: expertise is as important as the ability to facilitate learning. However, as we've learned from Hirst, it's not the teacher who does the learning, the students do.¬†_Therefore, ==how might we effectively encourage students to think, engage and learn with us, teachers? How might we help our students \"make music\"?_==¬†These are some of the questions we'll ask in this last module\n\n#### Who is learning?\nThe tricky part about teaching is that learning is not very visible. After all, it's happening in the heads of your learners (more about this in part 2). However, despite this limitation, we do know¬†**how**¬†learning happens.¬†_We know that learning is an active process!_\n![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20221106234855.png]]\n\nSo, the key question is: How can we create more opportunities for this active process to happen? What we know from the earliest teachers (like Socrates) is that ==we can do it through questions!== Here's a quick trivia about questions. How many questions do you think a typical teacher asks everyday? The answer: 395. To illustrate, a grade 3 teacher asks a question every 43 seconds (Stevens in Mariano and Simms, 2014).¬†\n\n==_What questions should we ask? Where will students' answers come from? How can we elicit responses from students?_¬†== These are some of the questions we'll discuss in this first part of the module.\n\n#### Questions about questions\nTo help you design your own questions for your teaching, we will ask 3 important design questions:\n1. What questions should we ask?\n2. Where will students' answers come from?\n3. How can we we elicit responses from students?\n\n##### Questioning Techniques and Teachers‚Äô Role in the Classroom\nhttps://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1268029.pdf\n\n\u003e The aim of this study is to discuss the ==efficacy of questioning techniques== of the teachers in the classroom. Proper questioning techniques are important in the teaching and learning process. Proper questioning techniques will make it easier for teachers to get feedback from students whether or not they understand the subject. This article describes some of the questioning techniques that a teacher needs to know to possess in classroom teaching and learning sessions such as ==attention, suitable voice. Pause, question content, and distribution of questions.== This is important for ==enhancing student motivation== and ==promoting positive, critical, and creative thinking== among students and ==to improve the teaching and learning process== in the classroom.\n\n###### Questioning Techniques\n1. Attention\n\t1. About this, the question must be ==addressed to the whole classroom== before a student is asked to answer.\n\t2. Teachers should also ==ask a question first before mentioning the name of a student to answer the question posed.== This is to ensure that all students are focused on the questions that are posted.\n\t3. Teachers should always ask questions to ==all students in the classroom== and not just to the students who raise their hands. Attention and care should be given to all the students in the classroom.\n\t4. In the meantime, some students who are not paying attention will ask the teacher to repeat the question. In this case, ==the teacher should not repeat the question posed when asked by the student to repeat it.== If the teacher repeats the question, then, of course, the student will not pay attention, so to attract the students, the teacher should mention the question only once.\n2. Voice\n\t1. When asking questions, teachers should make sure ==their voices are clear and that their tone is well-heard.==\n\t2. The questions should be ==presented well and clear== to the students and look forward to receiving answers.\n3. Pause\n\t1. After submitting a question, the teacher should be the one to ==pause talking for a moment and look at the whole class.== Note the ==verbal cues== that indicate that the student is ready to respond.\n\t2. After asking questions, students should be ==given time to think about the answers.== The time given should ==not be too long== because if it is too long, the interest in it will fade.\n4. Content of Questions\n\t1. In asking a question, a teacher should plan the types of questions that will be asked in the classroom. \n\t\t1. In this case, it may not be necessary for these questions to be prepared in advance, but the ==‚Äòaxis question‚Äô== needs to be designed. \n\t\t2. The axis questions should be arranged in a logical order to obtain continuity in the lesson. In a given lesson, the teacher should provide some questions like this to ==determine the desired direction.== These questions should not be too long.\n\t2. At the same time, teachers should also ask questions that are ==relevant to the age and ability== of the students in the class. \n\t\t1. Teachers are already aware of a student‚Äôs ability in a classroom. So when asking questions, teachers can ==ask difficult questions to the clever and gifted students, and ask easy questions to the weak students.== The simple questions posed to the weaker students will enable them to answer the question, and this will motivate them and stimulate their thinking.\n\t3. Teachers should also encourage ==questions that imply answers. ==\n\t\t1. Teachers should also ensure that the words used in a question are easy to understand. Students will be confused if they do not understand the words that are used in a question. \n\t\t2. If a question is misunderstood by the students, the teacher should change his or her word, but the student should be given a chance to answer first.\n\n###### Distribution of Questions\n- In asking questions, teachers should ask questions to all students in the classroom. Questions shall be given to all the students to encourage them to participate in the teaching and learning process. (Atan Long, 1980: 145) \n- Teachers should also ==avoid asking questions according to the sitting position== of students in the classroom. This is because students who sat in the back and on the sides of the classroom are not paying attention and in the class. So, questions need to be posed to all students so that all students can focus and participate.\n- In the meantime, any questions a teacher have to ask should be ==in place.== Teachers should ==avoid asking questions when students are in the process of conducting a study or project.== \n- In asking questions and receiving answers from students, teachers should always ==help the student to come up with the correct answers by pulling these answers out of him. ==In this way, students will think more deeply and will try to answer the question. ‚Äú (Sharifah Alwiah Alsagoff, 1983: 215)\n\n###### Levels of Questions\n- Questions that will be posed in the teaching and learning activity should be diversified by the levels of questioning.\n- **Bloom's Taxonomy** applies here\n\t- Knowledge: Knowledge-based questions are questions that can easily digest students‚Äô memory. These types of questions should be chosen by teachers, especially when presenting new topics or ideas for students.\n\t- Understanding: After being exposed to a concept and knowledge, teachers should ask questions that are comprehensible. This means that teaching and learning activities will take place in the dimension of understanding or understanding activities.\n\t- Application: The following features of the questions involve the use of information provided to students. The application questions are intended to help students apply their knowledge through the information provided during the teaching and learning activities.\n\t- Analysis: The feature of the analysis question is that this form of question works to separate ideas. At a higher level, students will be presented with analytical questions, and teachers need to be careful so that students can follow the content of the subject and apply all the skills to them.\n\t- Synthesis: Synthesis questions are questions that can help students to come up with a new idea through the initial information they are exposed to. These skills also require high skills in which teachers need to guide students until they can synthesize information.\n\t- Evaluation: At the highest level, evaluation based questions will be given to students. Evaluation means students should be able to make and maintain their justifications.\n\n###### Other Categories of Questions\n1. **First-Order Questions:** These types of questions are the most commonly used questions. This question is stated in sequence because it follows the sequence of disclosure of information provided in the teaching and learning activities\n2. **Uncovered Questions:** Uncovered questions are a type of question that can gradually grind out students‚Äô knowledge. This technique also requires teachers to tackle creative, clear, and easy questions so that students do not get bored.\n3. **Open-Ended Questions:** Open-ended questions are a form of independent inquiry that seeks to assess students‚Äô abilities and knowledge. Also, students may ask the teacher otherwise for the purpose of obtaining further certainty and clarification. This kind of response is something that is expected of teachers to identify students‚Äô understanding\n4. **Divergent Questions:** Divergent questions are questions that can generate a lot of thinking abilities among students. Subjective questions will help students broaden the scope of their thinking, and this is very important for them to improve their thinking skills.\n\n##### Teaching with Questions Lecture\n###### Part 1: What questions should I ask?\n- 2 paradigms\n\t- **Question Types** (LOTS to HOTS based on Bloom's Taxonomy)\n\t\t- Examples:\n\t\t\t- Ecology ![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20221107004204.png]]\n\t\t\t- Marketing ![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20221107004356.png]]\n\t- **Questioning Sequences**\n\t\t- 4 phases (+ applied to the ecology example):\n\t\t\t- Details\n\t\t\t\t- Ask questions about important details/areas of focus\n\t\t\t\t- Based on learning outcomes\n\t\t\t- Categories\n\t\t\t\t- Identify examples within a category\n\t\t\t\t- Describe the general characteristics\n\t\t\t\t- Make comparisons within and across categories\n\t\t\t- Elaborations\n\t\t\t\t- explain reasons for characteristics (WHY)\n\t\t\t\t- describe effects of specific characteristics\n\t\t\t\t- project occurences under certain conditions (WHAT IF)\n\t\t\t- Evidence\n\t\t\t\t- identify sources\n\t\t\t\t- explain reasoning\n\t\t\t\t- qualify/restrict conclusions\n\t\t\t\t- find errors in reasoning used\n\t\t\t\t- examine elaborations from diff. perspectives\n\t\t- Example (applied to ecology) ![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20221107005913.png]]\n\n\u003e For learning or understanding to happen...\n\u003e There has to be...\n\u003e ...a provocative question\n\u003e ...a puzzling, important problem\n\u003e ...a challenge to current understanding\n\u003e - Dewey, 1997\n\n![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20221107010411.png]]\n\n###### Part 2: Where will students' answers come from?\n- They come from...\n\t- Prior knowledge/experiences\n\t- Other sources\n- Zone of Proximal Development\n\t- move slowly from what students can do to what they can't do\n\n![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20221107011035.png]]\n\n![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20221107011508.png]]\n\n###### Part 3: How can I elicit responses?\n- **Wait time**\n\t- Ask \u003e Pause \u003e Listen \u003e Pause \u003e Ask\n\t- \"Research on classroom questioning and information processing indicates that students need ==at least three seconds== to comprehend a question...\"\n\t- Wait time is think time\n- **Random names**\n\t- Ask \u003e Teacher picks a random name \u003e Student answers\n- **Response chain**\n\t- Ask \u003e Student 1 answers \u003e Ask Student 2 to respond to Student 1\n- **Paired response** (a.k.a.

If you were to facilitate a discussion with your future students, what are 3 questions that you might ask? In the post below,\n\u003e 1. Identify the learning objective/s.\n\u003e 2. Identify the 3 questions and label them according to type or phase.\n\n**Learning objectives:**\n- Students should be able to demonstrate a sufficient understanding of the interactions between culture and technology¬†through closed-book short answer tests¬†where they have to cite keywords + insights from class readings.\n- Utilizing critical theory, students should be able to analyze contemporary technologies through written long-form essays.\n\n**Questions:**\n\nI imagine myself asking these questions to my future students after making them watch this documentary called *Terms and Conditions:*\n\n\u003e **Terms and Conditions:** a documentary film¬†that addresses how corporations and the government utilize the information that users provide when agreeing to browse a website, install an application, or purchase goods online. The film criticizes companies such as¬†[Facebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook \"Facebook\"),¬†[Google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google \"Google\"), and¬†[LinkedIn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LinkedIn \"LinkedIn\")¬†for having poorly worded and misguiding¬†[privacy policies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_Policy \"Privacy Policy\")/[terms of service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terms_of_service \"Terms of service\"), which use user-unfriendly language in long documents and allows the companies to collect user information and legally provide it to third-parties.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terms_and_Conditions_May_Apply#cite_note-1)¬†The film aims to warn people about the risks of clicking \"I Agree\" after scrolling through pages of uninviting text.\n\n\n1. Connect components of a social media platform to elements of structuralism. (Categories)\n\t1. Sign: user-generated content (e.g. posts, stories, comments, etc.)\n\t2. Code: user-service agreements\n\t3. Myth: \"It's okay to give away your personal data\" a.k.a. being apathetic about data privacy\n2. Why do social media platforms uphold this myth about data privacy? (Elaborations)\n3. How can users hold platforms accountable for these privacy issues? (Evidence)\n\n#### Key ideas about Teaching with Questions\n\n**1. Questions**¬†(not just answers)¬†**drive learning.**\nOften, as teachers, there could be a tendency to focus on what we will say (or present), not what we will ask. As we've discussed in this module, ==what we ask matters, because our questions prompt thinking.==\n\n**2. Interaction should be intentionally designed, not just a happy accident.**\nAlthough there are many things we cannot predict about how our class sessions will go, it still pays to be intentional with the kinds of interaction you would like to have with your students and among your students. As an expert teacher in the future, this may just end up feeling \"natural\", such that you don't feel like you need to plan it out anymore (just like in other professions), but as a novice educator, the invitation is to ==carefully plan your \"teaching moves\"¬† first.==","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.727605418Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2022-11-08":{"title":"2022-11-08","content":"## Soul's Gold Reading\n- Higher Guide...Soul's Blueprint\n\t- Orange tree: very stubborn, rooted, persistent (may be perceived as stuck because it looks still)\n\t- very ecosystem\n\t\t- no door...all of it is important and full\n\t- Not super vocal...

After getting answers, I will point out that they all already know how to evaluate messages (unconsciously)\n\t\t3. https://isi.org/intercollegiate-review/tinder-and-semiotics/\n2. Talking about texts\n\t1. Definition of terms\n\t\t1. ‚ÄúMessage‚Äù or text: refers to any recorded message(e.g.,¬†writing,¬†audio-recording,¬†audio-and video-recording) that is physically independent of itssender or¬†receiver\n\t\t3. To produce a quality text, we need to think of:\n\t\t\t1. Structure: how the information is organized.\n\t\t\t2. Language: the means by which the information is expressed verbally and/or nonverbally.\n\t\t\t3. Presentation: the layout, format, length, oral delivery and¬†any other conventions.\n\t2. Introduce/review of semiotics\n\t\t1. How can we interpret messages? through symbiotics\n\t\t2. Definition: the study of signs and symbols, in particular as they communicate things spoken and unspoken In a semiotic sense, signs take the form of words,¬†images¬†sounds,¬†gestures,¬†and objects.\n\t\t3. Signs are composed of...\n\t\t\t1. Signifiers (represenations/modalities such as images, sound, etc.)\n\t\t\t2. Signifieds (concepts)\n\t\t4. Semiotic systems (more than just visual!)...\n\t\t\t1. Linguistic or textual system: vocabulary, structure, grammarof oral/written language, wordchoice, delivery of spoken orwritten text (tone), organizationinto sentences, phrases,paragraphs.\n\t\t\t2. Visual system: Color, vectors and viewpoint in still andmoving images, layout,style, size, perspective.\n\t\t\t3. Audio system: Volume, pitch andrhythm of music and sound effects.\n\t\t\t4. Gestural system: Movement, facial expression and body language, hand gestures, interactions between people.\n\t\t\t5. Spatial system: Proximity, direction, position of layout,organization of objects in space arrangement.\n\t\t5.  Examples: \n\t\t\t1. emojis (a Japanese word thattranslates in English as \"e\" for \"picture\" and \"moji\" for \"character)\n\t\t\t2. emoticons (digitalicons that convey human expressions)\n\t\t\t3. Processing question: ask class what they think is the signifier and the singified in emojis and emoticons \n3. Texts can reflect cultures\n\t1. Prompt\n\t\t1. Since reality is always subject to human interpretation...\n\t\t2. ...a person's background will inherently affect their interpretation of reality\n\t2. Semiotics can refer to a kind of social interaction among individuals who try to make sense out of the different interpretations possibilities of a sign.\n\t\t1. This is where culture comes in\n\t3. Definition: \n\t\t1. Cultural texts are those objects, actions, and behaviors that reveal cultural meanings. \n\t\t2.

He runs an experiment to monitor the level of \"thinking\" happening for one student for 7 days. Spend some time reviewing the graph below. Without delving too much into the science of the experiment, just interpret the graphs to mean that more peaks mean more thinking/more brain activity is happening.\n![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20221115141159.png]]\n\u003e note: it is unclear what is being done in class (we assume here that it is probably a straight lecture). This is not to say that lectures are bad and ineffective - they can, in fact, be quite effective!\n\u003e However, if most of the time it's just the teacher talking in front, there is less of a chance to actually \"see\" learning happen. This is what we try to address by asking more questions.¬†\n\u003e In this 2nd part of the module, we will build on this idea of making learning more visible to both learners and teachers. We'll do so by reviewing some strategies produced from the research conducted by Harvard Project Zero.\n\n#### Visible Thinking Routines\n- Overview of thinking routines: [**Development of Harvard Project Zero featuring Ron Ritchhart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFNpxBLyFQk)\n- Example of a thinking routine: [**Think, Puzzle, Explore in the Classroom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLXglUq5slY)\n- [**Project Zero's Thinking Routine Toolbox**](http://www.pz.harvard.edu/thinking-routines)\n\n#### Module 4 One Big Final Exit Ticket\n1. As a final exit ticket for module 4 and the course, use¬†[any visible thinking strategy¬†Links to an external site.](http://www.pz.harvard.edu/thinking-routines)to help you synthesize what you learned from this course. If you prefer to do it on paper, you can do so and just post a picture of your work. Share your answer and why you think that is the most appropriate strategy to use.\n\n2. Since it's the last activity of the module, please also share about your experience as a learner in Module 4. How did you find Module 4? What helped you learn? What hindered learning? (It's okay you can be honest. Your feedback will help me make necessary adjustments in the coming modules, if necessary).¬†\n\n4. The estimated learning time for the whole module is about 3 hours (about 1.5 hours per sub module). Did it take you that long? More or less? What were factors that contributed to the length of time?\n\n**Visible Thinking Strategy:** Color, Symbol, Image is a routine for distilling the essence of ideas non-verbally. Out of all the other strategies under the \"Synthesizing \u0026 Organizing Ideas\" category, I chose this because I'm a visual learner; as a designer and artist, I find skills such as visual association to be intuitive for me. Thus, this strategy seemed like the easiest to utilize.\n\nWhat I visually associate with the EDUC 130 course:\n- **Color:** Blue. Aside from blue being the color of our Canvas interface, I chose blue because it is great at promoting high levels of thought. For instance: blue paper, blue ink, or blue highlighting can be used to help improve reading comprehension. Blue's utility is especially seen in learning situations that are challenging. For example: people with occupations that require a high cognitive load, such as programmers and academics, are more productive in a blue environment.   Just like the color blue, the methods I've learned for designing and facilitating learning are all ways to help our students with processing knowledge (e.g. scaffolding, questioning techniques, thinking routines).\n- **Symbol:** A ticket. I associated this with Entrance and Exit Ticket activites teachers would often utilize in their classrooms, wherein a short prompt would be used to make students either recall relevant background knowledge or reflect on their learnings. This activity shows the important role of student feedback in guiding teaching decisions. Without feedback, teachers won't be able to help students connect to the lesson (Activate from Context ‚Üí Connect to Content) or gauge their understanding of it (Evaluate to Validate). \n- **Image:** Brain waves in the classroom. I thought of this image after being inspired by Dr. Ito's brain activity monitoring experiment. I chose this because I think all teachers should aim for high brain-to-brain synchrony. We can only say that our lessons are effective and engaging if we ensure that no learner gets left behind. Teachers who are mindful of student and teacher factors will be able to equitably engage with their learners.\n  \n**Sources:**\n- https://www.shiftelearning.com/blog/how-do-colors-influence-learning\n- https://www.brown.edu/sheridan/teaching-learning-resources/teaching-resources/course-design/classroom-assessment/entrance-and-exit\n- https://kids.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frym.2020.00096\n\n**My experience as a learner in Module 4:**\n- It was interesting being exposed to all the different kinds of different routines! However, I preferred the previous modules because of how they contained much more written and visual information, which made it easier for me to take notes (compared to external sources like videos and websites). I did like how Project Zero's Thinking Routine toolbox contained easily digetsible PDFs for each routine!\n- I do think that I spent the expected amount of time on this module. Perhaps because it was shorter, and there wasn't as much activities to do?\n\n#### Summary of Module 4\n**1.**¬†Design varied and deepening questions that intend to elicit learning for specific learning objective.\n**2.**¬†Accurately demonstrate the use of a visible thinking strategy for a specific lesson.\n\n## PH Design\n#design #culture #Filipino \n### Reclaiming our Narrative (2021)\n_Reclaiming our Narrative: Inclusivity and Decolonization_¬†(2021):¬†[https://www.facebook.com/nbdb.phil/videos/124056096443064/](https://www.facebook.com/nbdb.phil/videos/124056096443064/)\n\n\u003e POST-PANDEMIC FUTURES.

Pre-Hispanic Philippine art and expression were minuscule: it focused on meaning and tradition, not the grandiose. On the other hand, post-colonial art and expression are influenced by our colonizers' form of art and expression, which were grand in size and focused more on forms, not the embedded meaning.== This expression of culture is exquisite yet minuscule, may it be textile, jewelry, woodwork, sculptures, and other crafts - even in weaponry and armor.¬†As seen in the screenshot below, this shield had various inscriptions all over, which were a mix of religious texts of the Moro people.\n\u003e Other parts of the presentation that piqued my interest were her discussion of a number of terms that were to be junked and ones that should be used with care. Some of the terms to be junked that she mentioned caught my attention - specifically Malay (which she explained was a language and not a race) and race (which is not a legit category). I always thought that the Philippines came from the \"Malay\" people given the many commonalities we have in terms of culture and physique. She debunked such, explaining that the Filipinos are part of the Austronesian-speaking people that originated from Taiwan (not Chinese nor Han) and spread Southwards to Indonesia, Malaysia, and Polynesian areas. She added that the languages of the islands in the Polynesian areas actually originated from the Philippines, citing that some people from Luzon sailed out into the Pacific Ocean, ending up on a then-uninhabited island - Guam. In relation to such, Ms. Marian also clarified some terms to use with care such as dialect. I always had confusion with these two terms, but she clarified such, saying that Cebuano and Tagalog are not dialects, but languages. Some examples of dialects are the Batangas-Tagalog and Mindoro-Tagalog dialects.\n\u003e Lastly, her closing also piqued my interest. She explained that all that she has shared in her presentation, although may sound opinionated (specifically the portion of \"Words to Junk\"), are based on scientific evidence and scholarly research. The information she shared has been agreed upon by many archaeologists globally, yet is not known to the locals who are the topic of the research. She says that the problem lies in ==how this information is not circulated in mainstream media.== Furthermore, she suggests solving this problem ==not only by publishing this information to make it accessible physically but by also translating this knowledge from scientific to easily digestible terms.== She ends by saying that \"the task of knowing the updated, evidence-based syntheses about the Filipinos more than a nationalistic endeavor. It concerns social justice.\"\n\n#### Discussion Board\n**Share a screenshot of one scene or moment from the webinar. In a few sentences, explain to us why this image stood out for you.**\n\n![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20221115145317.png]]\n\nThis slide stood out to me from the webinar because of how much it reminded me of the process of *indigenization*, which we discussed in Module 2. In a world filled with tribalistic news and disinformation, the Filipino identity is being pigeonholed into restrictive definitions. We have to realize that it is impossible to define what it means to be Filipino without acknowledging how we are made up of foreign influences.\n\n### Disjuncture and Difference in the Global Cultural Economy\nIn understanding Philippine design, it is important to appreciate and understand the dynamics of cultural flows.\n\n- READ: ‚ÄúDisjuncture and Difference in the Global Cultural Economy‚Äù\n- See: [[Miscellaneous Notes/Daily Notes/2022-07-13]]\n- https://socialsci.libretexts.org/Courses/HACC_Central_Pennsylvania's_Community_College/ANTH_205%3A_Cultures_of_the_World_-_Perspectives_on_Culture_(Scheib)/13%3A_Globalization/13.02%3A_The_Acceleration_of_Globalization\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_cultural_flows\n\n\u003e Choose one particular Philippine design object that you love. (Please include an image and related links.) Using Appadurai‚Äôs five proposed landscapes, identify the cultural flows that produced the work.\n\n![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20221115152553.png]]\n\n**Philippine Design object:** Local zines! I will be using the ones made by [Mak√≥ Micro-Press](https://makomicropress.com/) as an example.\n- **Ethnoscapes** \n\t- When they settled in the Philippines, our colonizers (i.e. the Spanish, Americans, Japanse) brought with them colonial values, ideas, mindsets, etc. One of the ways they disseminated this was through presses.\n\t- One of the earliest underground publications, La Solidaridad, was created by a group of ilustrados. Many of them were educated in¬†Spain, which exposed them to European liberal¬†and nationalist ideals.\n- **Technoscapes**\n\t- The rise of alternative press publications such as zines wouldn't have been possible without the large-scale production and distribution of the printing press.\n\t- Photocopying machines also played a big role in their circulation, as seen in Xerox Journalism: the underground or illegal publishing that occurred during Martial Law. \n\t- The advent of the Internet kickstarted digital self-publishing. Creators can distribute their zines by uploading them as PDF copies to personal storage platforms or online repositories, such as Google Drive and the Anarchist Library. Blogs and social media websites like Instagram are also hopeful for promotion; these platforms can be seen as the \"modern\" equivalent of zines due to their shared self-published nature.\n\t- Despite the 21st century's primary focus on everything digital, the print format of the zine remains relevant. By sticking to print, zines rebel against the cultural dominance of internet platforms. The format also gives creators ‚Äúsafety in-print‚Äù by helping them avoid strict copyright and community standard restrictions, along with malicious attention (e.g. redtagging). \n- **Financescapes**\n\t- The introduction of electronic money through mobile wallets like GCash and Maya have definitely made it easier to sell zines to a wider audience. Now, self-publishers are no longer restricted by physical confinements and print runs that only reach those who attend events.\n\t- Financescapes can also be seen in the growing popularity of zines. It could be said that their rise stems partly from an economic shift, particularly in the creative sector. Zine veteran Paolo Jose Cruz notes how in recent times there had been a¬†_‚Äúgeneral clamor for more tangible analog and print media‚Äù_¬†as well as a commercial landscape that leans towards¬†_‚Äúmore niche or specialty arts and craft hobbies.‚Äù_¬†And with this focus on creative work, sprung more avenues; examples of these avenues are fine arts classes and workshops about¬†_‚Äúmonetizing art creation‚Äù_¬†and the emergence of mixed spaces where zines can find a substantial consumer base.\n\t- These mixed spaces are local fairs, expos, and conventions. Through a steady combination of marketing and select exhibitors, zine creators were pushed into broader public consciousness and propelled the scene towards popularity. By shunning traditional notions of marketing, self-publishers, zine fair organisers and editors are generating validity around underrepresented artists and makers.\n- **Mediascapes**\n\t- ¬†The bourgeois take control of the media industry. One example is Martial Law censorship, wherein the industry was monopolized by Marcos' regime. Newspapers, radio and TV networks run by Marcos cronies served as mouthpieces of the dictatorship. The Marcos regime also established the Kapisanan ng mga Brodkaster ng Pilipinas (KBP or Association of Broadcasters of the Philippines) as a way of controlling the broadcast industry under the doctrine of self-censorship. Now, we can still see this censorhsip today, given our current government (e.g. ABS-CBN shutdown).\n\t- In contrast to this: Self-publishing is heavily rooted in the Punk subculture, wherein musical freedom was connected with the human ability to reason and ask questions. In line with this, it was a disc jockey (Dante ‚ÄúHowling Dave‚Äù David) who introduced fanzines to Metro Manila on his show at dzRJ 810 ‚ÄúRock of Manila‚Äù. Consequently, many early local fanzines were centered around alternative music.\n- **Ideoscapes**\n\t- Writer and self-publisher Adam David states that zines must serve as manifestos, not propagandas. The latter involves messaging wherein the reader is coereced into believing false truths, while the former is a manifestation of one's inner truth, or that of the movement they choose to belong to. Manifestos, being proactive, encourage the reader to join a cause or adopt a mindset.\n\t- Through zines and other DIY (Do-It-Yourself) artwork, Mak√≥ Micro-Press aims to create and sustain counter-hegemonic cultures. Critiquing existing systems of oppression (e.g. capitalism, fascism), they advocate for alternative radical movements such as socialism and abolitionism.\n\t- Utilizing the Filipino language in their zines helps Mak√≥ helps disseminate these ideologies. This kind of translation is vital in a nation that is heavily misinformed about these movements, as seen in the pervasiveness of redtagging.\n\n**Sources:**\n- https://aramslasharam.wordpress.com/2018/02/10/19/\n- https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED311426.pdf\n- https://www.cnnphilippines.com/life/culture/literature/2017/08/30/zine-making-adam-david.html\n- https://purveyr.com/2018/09/10/zine-culture-in-the-philippines/\n- https://www.dazeddigital.com/artsandculture/article/25561/1/how-the-internet-revived-the-zine-scene\n\n### Pamumuna, pagtutol, pagka-Filipino, pagkabansa\n\nEach of the abovementioned living cultures manifests itself in design. Think of one example each, and in a few sentences, explain to us why you chose these examples. Be more thoughtful and try to go beyond the obvious.\n\n-   Kultura ng Pamumuna at Pagtutol: Culture of Social Criticism, Concern, and Protest\n\t- When I think about Kultura ng Pamumuna at Pagtutol, Mako Micropress's stickers come to mind. These would often advocate human rights and critque social issues such as neoliberalism and neocolonialism. I'd see these stickers often at local conventions and stores like Common Room. At first, I didn't fully understand what these stickers were talking about; this led me wanting to learn more. I definitely believe that these stickers influenced me to have radical values.\n-   Kultura ng Pagkabansa: \n\t- For Kultura ng Pagkabansa, I can't help but think about BBM's presidential campaign. Albeit being twisted, this campaign was built on nationalist sentiments, e.g. unity. His campaign slogan, \"Sama-sama tayong babangon muli\", is reminiscent of Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" ‚Äî both presidents reeking of right-wing populism. Unfortunately, his campaign achieved its desired, as seen with his 31 million voters. When his voters changed their profile pictures to red squares, they did it to show that they were being devoted Filipinos.\n\n![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20221115172029.png]]\n![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20221115172503.png]]\n\n### Ating Buhay\n#### Prompt\n\u003e In this module, we learned about how our culture and identities‚Äîincluding our design practices‚Äîare negotiated amid the push and pull of ideology and political economy. Our experience as a nation is full of traumas, disappointments, and lacunae; thus, we tend to feel deracinated, unmoored, lost.¬†\n\u003e \n\u003e Sometimes, we are doubtful of identifying as Filipino‚Äîafter all, what is ‚ÄúFilipino‚Äù anyway? And yet, whatever design practice you will develop from hereon will be part of the corpus known as ‚ÄúPhilippine design.‚Äù¬†\n\u003e \n\u003e In this project, we will try to locate your life as part of the historical progression of our nation‚Äôs narrative. Whatever your experience, it is part of the Filipino story.\n\n[**Measure your history with material. | Sonya Clark | The Art Assignment**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTn9N8rsm-M)\n- Today we talk to textile artist Sonya Clark, who applies the techniques of textile work to represent her personal and cultural history. Her assignment draws on her insightful approach to histories and asks you to represent yours.\n- INSTRUCTIONS - Measuring Histories \n\t1. Think about an aspect of your personal or cultural history that is hard to imagine \n\t2. Select a material to quantify, measure, and actualize that history \n\t3. Or, do something familiar to you for as long as you can and measure it to see what it lines up with from your personal or cultural history\n\n\u003e Ponder on your life so far. Think of a material available to you, and how it can embody something about your history (whether as an individual, part of a family or in relation to a community), something meaningful to you that you would like to share. Devise a work by exploring this material. Note: this exercise may require you to look into parts of you that you‚Äôve avoided or been uncomfortable talking about, and hence be met by difficulty or hesitation. Lean into that discomfort.\n\n#### Proposals\n- I think i want to lean into my girly roots\n- thinking about my struggle with identity..\n- stickers?\n- dress-up games, piccrew\n- https://society.mirror.xyz/8HWXty6Zvzje_vGv9TPFHRoJZ38feL3tFCvOPcLKz_U\n\t- Dollz, and their era, cemented the idea of the self-expression and value of the avatar creator beyond paper dolls.

Indirect?) on those most in need on a survival level (given ‚Äòsurvival‚Äô is brought up).

This is not surprising, given that ==most digital technologies are produced by and for urban, Global North populations.== When the focus shifts to Indigenous, rural, or Global South communities, discussions tend to be much ==more instrumental and one-dimensional== (Salemink et al., 2017). In these contexts, ==digital participation is often implicitly assumed to be beneficial in instrumental ways‚Äîit enables economic advances and provides access to better services and governance.== This assumption allows focus to be placed squarely on technocratic questions related to access and digital divides (Roberts et al., 2017). Less investigated are the knowledge politics which shape and constrain the types of political and economic engagement that digital connectivity makes possible, and whether those forms of engagement are compatible with the specific needs and desires of populations that fall outside of the urban, Global North.\n\n\u003e In response to this gap, scholars are increasingly calling for new research agendas focused on ==the critical examination of ICTs outside the Global North.== D√© et al. (2018), for example, argue that ==there is currently ‚Äúinadequate theory to examine how the local context [of developing countries] is impacted by ICT and how ICTs are impacted by the local context.‚Äù== (67) They call for stronger inclusion of postcolonial thinking within ICT for development (ICT4D) interventions to facilitate the exploration of new, critical questions. Within the disciplines of geography, digital geographies researchers are exploring similar forms of research. Thatcher et al. (2016) have called for the development of a political economy of data, to better understand ==the role of the digital in everyday processes of capitalist exploitation.== In each case the researchers call for greater attention to the colonial implications of technology engagement. This paper contributes to this growing body of work by examining how digital practices facilitate new forms of knowledge politics that have colonial impacts for Indigenous communities. Specifically, I argue that digital engagement can erode the embodied and social practices that are critical to the transmission of some forms of Indigenous knowledge. I ground this argument in a critical examination of ICT usage within an Inuit community in the Canadian Arctic.\n\n\u003e This research documents how ==many ICT interventions extend globally dominant power and knowledge systems into affected communities in the Global South== (Burns, 2014; Heeks, 2008; Walsham, 2012). However, this work remains primarily focused on the institutional adoption of ICTs for development work, and there are few studies grounded in the empirical realities of how digital knowledge politics unfold in specific Indigenous communities. In the context of the Arctic, the closest research has come to examining these issues is a handful of projects on the negative impact of social media on the language (Inuktitut) and culture of Inuit (e.g. Pasch, 2008, 2010; Savard, 1998). This paper builds on that prior work by extending analysis explicitly to interactions between digital practices and Inuit knowledge.\n\n[**History of Philippine Digitalization**](https://digitaljustice.cp-union.com/publications/2021/09/09/History-Philippine-Digitalization)\n\u003e This paper entitled ‚ÄúHistory of Digitalization in the Philippines‚Äù discusses digitalization in the Philippines with a particular emphasis on the roots and current status of its information and communications technology (ICT). This research suggests that although the Philippines is one of the early colonial countries in Asia-Pacific to obtain and use early-digitized technologies, the foreign-dependent economic model under its colonial masters and neoliberalism-oriented leaders had hampered the industrialization of the country most notably in the 1960s-70s. The lost momentum to industrialize, along with economic policies that are foreign-oriented, caused the Philippines to become dependent on the service industry. ==The lack of national industry and grand political plan to do so lead the Philippine ICT to be highly reliant on foreign technologies and software which has a negative impact on the pace of current digitalization in the Philippines.==\n\n[**Introduction: the dynamics of digital communication in the Philippines: legacies and potentials**](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1329878X211010868)\n\u003e The following articles demonstrate manifestations and dynamics of capitalist \nmodernity. We identify three overlapping themes which indicate how the affordances \nand uses of digital media contribute to the accumulation of various forms of capital \nand the acceleration of social processes that create new and reinforce existing social \ninequalities (Fuchs, 2014; Rosa, 2014). The ethnographic and qualitative nature of the \nstudies provides nuances to the simultaneous possibilities for liberation and \nexploitation (Jordan, 2015) amid digital media‚Äôs embedding in everyday life. Each \ntheme characterises a socio-technical dynamic that indicates continuities, \ncontradictions and changes in society. \n\n\u003e Digital media uses, practices and experiences are rooted in pre-existing social and \ncultural formations, economic structures and political systems (Athique, 2019). Even \nas the digital media environment presents various possibilities for action and social \nrelations, uneven infrastructure and material conditions shape people‚Äôs engagements \nwith digital media. This is salient in Toyama‚Äôs (2011) argument that ==technologies are \nnot transformative or democratising in themselves, but rather, they amplify human \nforces along with existing inequalities and missing institutional capaci- ties==\n\n[**Digital Justice Perception Survey**](https://digitaljustice.cp-union.com/publications/2021/08/26/Digital-Justice-Perception-Survey)\n\u003e The Digital Justice Perception Survey (DJPS) of the Philippine Digital Justice Initiative (PHDJI) is research whose aim is to gather the perception and gauge the level of literacy of Filipinos regarding data justice and other substantially related issues. With internet-connected citizens of Metro Manila participating in the survey, it was found that a significant portion of respondents is still unequipped on the concepts of digitalization and digital justice despite the stated confidence and familiarity on their part. Although some are knowledgeable on the basics, a huge portion is still either neutral or unaware of the topic of digital justice and the like. This research concludes that further educational campaigns (preferably specialized) and movements to educate and equip the public are very much needed, especially with the rapidity of digitalization intensified by the ongoing pandemic.\n\n**Transforming Technologies: Altered Selves ‚Äì Mobile Phones and Internet Use in\nthe Philippines**\n\u003e Following these ‚Äúconclusions and extrapolations,‚Äù chapters 1 and 2 provide broad perspectives on cellphones and the Internet in the context of the Philippines. In chapter 1 on ‚ÄúScience, Technology and Culture,‚Äù Pertierra offers a pessimistic assessment of the former fields (science and technology) in the context of the latter (Filipino culture). His position is that Filipino culture is very open to receiving and consuming technologies produced elsewhere (such as cellphones), but that a cultural aversion to excellence and specialization has proven a general impediment to the development of basic science and therefore local production of innovative technologies. ==Filipino society, he argues, can take technologies from elsewhere ‚Äì jeeps or cellphones, for instance ‚Äì and refashion them for use in the local context, but due to the discouragement of specialization is less adept at more fundamental scientific or technological originality.==\n\n- relate to concept of indeginization from Philippine design\n\n[**The Role of Everyday Culture for a Scientific Orientation in Philippine Society: Are the Youth Any

the platform economy](https://www.scielo.br/j/soc/a/xsw6y66hJR6X5BQhjKc59JK/?format=pdf\u0026lang=en)\n\t\t\t- EXAMPLE\n\t\t\t- As such, we propose the term digital labor bayanihan as encapsulating a Filipino cultural value that shapes the collective ‚Äúanchoring‚Äù of digital platform workers to survive a precarious digital market. Although this ‚Äúconcept‚Äù emerges from the Philippine context, the ideas may be relatable to or extended in contexts where sources of collective imaginaries are comparable. \n\t\t\t- In the process of coaching, labor influencers also cascade imaginaries of success to their audiences...These imaginaries of success can be seen as a modern form of ‚Äúcoaching‚Äù manifested through self-branding techniques such as repetition styles and sharing of personal narratives.\n\t\t\t- While [digital labor influencers] play a crucial role in helping workers make sense of platform labor when they have no better alternatives nor access to similar forms of dynamic guidance elsewhere, they also cascade imaginaries that workers hang on to, as these nurture their economic and social aspirations, whether these latter are realized or not. It is in the heart of such contradictions that platform workers imagine new forms of sociability, visions of happiness, and economic capacities, despite uncertainty on whether these can in fact be actualized (de Peuter et al., 2017). This implies that they also perform the role not only of bridging workers with each other, but bridging workers with platforms, essentially performing unpaid labor for digital platforms. It follows that they also serve as promoters of the Philippine government‚Äôs vision of promoting Filipinos as ‚Äúworld class workers‚Äù while allowing it (along with digital platforms) to avoid its responsibility to attend to the deeper structures of labor inequality.\n\t\t\t- TL;DR by cultivating aspirations these influencers also help sustain inequities\n\t\t- \n- Developing countries and tech\n\t- The Innovation Paradox\n\t\t- https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/28341/211160ov.pdf\n\t\t- https://academic.oup.com/book/26367/chapter-abstract/194692883?redirectedFrom=fulltext\n\t\t\t- limited mental model of labor\n\t- [Participatory foresight and reflexive innovation: setting policy goals and developing strategies in a bottom-up, mission-oriented, sustainable way](https://eujournalfuturesresearch.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40309-021-00171-6)\n\t\t- EXHIBIT, METHOD\n\t\t- We might further consider how narrative generation can facilitate in bringing lofty, but ambiguous, goals back within the sphere of everyday life. In so doing, these stories can utilize various concepts (technological, legal, organizational, etc.) to illustrate how a future imaginary might impact the life choices and daily routines of a vibrant citizenry.\n\t- Technology of the Oppressed: Inequity and the Digital Mundane in Favelas of Brazil\n\t\t- inspiration for speculative design process probably....Mundane Technology\n\t\t- Scholars and technology designers have often perceived the oppressed as mere consumers of technologies rather than as agents empowered by them (Rangaswamy and Cutrell 2012). This tension between oppression and empowerment turns digital technologies‚Äîas with every aspect of the life of the oppressed‚Äîinto a site of struggle, revealing the structural violence of the information age. Rendering such oppression visible makes it available for intervention and change (Eubanks 2012). After seeing how his neighborhood was framed online, Pedro became more aware of the biases of digital platforms. But in order for people like him to survive, they need to consciously resist oppressions and appropriate technology rather than reject it.\n\t\t- Technology is not a separate world‚Äîit is an extension of the struggles we all face. Thus, in this book, I explore ==how people critically appropriate technologies to navigate both digital and nondigital sources of oppression==. To guide this exploration, I borrow Paulo Freire‚Äôs notion of oppression, which he defines as acts of exploitation and violence and a failure ‚Äúto recognize others as persons‚Äù (2000, 55). Over the course of the book, I will evolve and mature Freire‚Äôs rather vague notion of oppression, building a framework around the challenges that favela residents encounter. This framework represents how I understand the role of digital technologies in favelas: Residents grapple with daily challenges from specific axes of oppression in their lives. ==Appropriating Mundane Technologies is their act of hope; they use technology to seek liberation.== Therefore, we need to shift our understanding of the role of technology in oppressive situations.\n\t\t- Freire‚Äôs invitation to others to reinvent his ideas inspired me to develop a framework that seeks to understand why digital technologies can be simultaneously sites of oppression and tools that can be appropriated by the oppressed in their pursuit of freedom. I use the term Mundane Technology to describe this framework. It doesn‚Äôt provide a method or a set of techniques to liberate the oppressed, nor it is a pedagogical plan. Rather, I conceptualize Mundane Technology as an episteme to understand oppression and Freire‚Äôs process of conscientiza√ß√£o in the information age. Similar to Virginia Eubanks and her arguments in Digital Dead End (2012), I believe that oppression should be the central diagnostic for technology. Using oppression as an outcome of concern allows us to see complex processes of exploitation, marginalization, powerlessness, cultural imperialism, and violence as centrally driving inequities of the information age. Identifying and calling out these systems of domination illuminate opportunities for intervention and change\n\t\t- Thus, Mundane Technologies‚Äîas appropriations of everyday technologies‚Äîare how technology is reinterpreted, adapted, and reinvented by those outside these centers of power in order to achieve liberation from oppression. Approaching Mundane Technologies as appropriations of technology opens new research avenues for culture and technology and contributes to a renewed concern for democracy\n- Colonialism\n\t- [Journeys of Displacement Between South and North: Decolonizing a Designer Imaginary](http://umu.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1249539\u0026dswid=702)\n\t- [Challenges and Paradoxes in Decolonising HCI: A Critical Discussion](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10606-021-09398-0)\n\t- [Participation as a way for a Postcolonial Design of ICT4Ds](https://mau.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1696988/FULLTEXT02.pdf)\n\t- [Understanding the City Decision Making Process regarding Colonialism and Sociotechnical Imaginary on Smart Cities Initiatives](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9096691)\n- Sociotechnical Imaginaries (tech only)\n\t- [Contradictory connectivity: spatial imaginaries and technomediated positionalities in Kenya‚Äôs outsourcing sector](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1068/a140275p)\n\t\t- METHOD\n\t\t- Kenya has long been characterized by an embeddedness into the global capitalist system that is marked by unequal power relationships. \n\t\t- Using an initial exploratory coding phase, a coding scheme was developed to code themes and interpretive codes. The codes offered a starting point for a theoretically informed textual analysis: allowing us to identify the things that people say about connectivity: both how they broadly envision it, and how they enact it in their everyday business practices.\n\t\t- All relevant sections of interviews were then reread to identify key discursive formations(4) (after Rose, 2001) and regimes of truth(5) (after Gill, 1996) that were being made persuasive.\n\t\t- Three broad themes emerged‚Äîthe global village, shrinking distance, and digital augmentations‚Äîthat broadly map onto key moments in the geographic literature on technology and connectivity.

Respondents are offered a series of questions or a set of scenarios with which they can choose to agree or disagree, and they are asked to elaborate on their remarks in written responses that provide insights into challenges and opportunities of the digital future at the time of each study. T\n\t\t- Examples\n\t\t\t- The Metaverse\n\t\t\t\t- _**The question:**¬†Considering what you know about the metaverse, which statement comes closer to your view about its likely evolution by 2040?_-   _By 2040 the metaverse WILL or WILL NOT be a much-more-refined and truly fully-immersive, well-functioning aspect of daily life for a half billion or more people globally._\n\t\t\t\t- The follow-up quantitative research questions were: Please elaborate on your answer. Tell us how you imagine that this shift of many online activities into more-fully-immersive digital spaces and digital life is likely to take place. Regardless of how you see the timing of this, how might it change human society? What are the likely positives of this transition? What negatives may emerge? How might it change the daily lives of the connected? And how will this transition change the way we think about our world and ourselves? We are also interested in hearing your thoughts about the role blockchain and its applications might play in this evolution of online life by 2040.\n\t\t\t- Hopes for Digital Life in 2035\n\t\t\t\t- The *entirety* of this particular report is based upon these participants‚Äô responses to the following prompt, which was the final question of several that were asked of this group:\n\t\t\t\t\t- We invite you to imagine a better world online: What is one example of an aspect of digital life that you think could be different in 2035 than it is today? We invite you to create a vignette of something you would like to see taking place in a ‚Äúnew and improved‚Äù digital realm in 2035. Your example might involve politics or social activities or jobs or physical and mental health or community life or education. Feel free to think expansively and specifically.\n\t\t\t\t- In order to understand the context of these responses, it is important to note that participants were asked to respond to the following sets of questions before the question that generated the answers covered in this report\n\t\t\t\t\t- The evolution of digital spaces by 2035: This canvassing of experts is prompted by debates about the evolution of digital spaces and whether online life is moving in a positive or negative direction when it comes to the overall good of society. Some analysts and activists are fearful about the trajectory of digital activities; others are less concerned about the things that are happening. So, we start with a question about the way you see things evolving.\n\t\t\t\t\t- The question: Considering the things you see occurring online, which statement comes closer to your view about the evolution of digital spaces: \n\t\t\t\t\t\t- Digital spaces are evolving in ways that are both positive and negative. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t- Digital spaces are evolving in a MOSTLY POSITIVE way that is likely to lead to a BETTER future for society. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t- Digital spaces are evolving in a MOSTLY NEGATIVE way that is likely to lead to a WORSE future for society. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t- Digital spaces are not evolving in one direction or another.\n\t\t\t\t- The following quantitative prompt and research questions of this study were:\n\t\t\t\t\t- Bettering the digital public sphere: An Atlantic Monthly piece by Anne Applebaum and Peter Pomerantsev, ‚ÄúHow to Put Out Democracy‚Äôs Dumpster Fire,‚Äù provides an overview of the questions that are being raised about the tone and impact of digital life: How much harm does the current online environment cause?

Recently, there is greatly increased attention to the ways that ==technology design, development, and deployment often reproduce existing forms of inequality.==3 There is a growing conversation about persistent gender and racial disparity in Silicon Valley.4 The use of ‚ÄúBig Data‚Äù across many areas of life has civil rights implications;5 for example, investigative reporting by ProPublica exposed algorithmic bias in predictive sentencing software, and highlighted racial inequality in the distribution of technological harms and benefits.6 Department of Homeland Security requests for software companies to help develop ‚Äúgood immigrant/bad immigrant‚Äù sorting software is feeding a debate about the ethical responsibilities of technology developers.7 Social media has become a terrain riddled with trolls, botnets, clickbait, and disinformation campaigns; some operate with political objectives, others for profit, and some just for the fun of it (or all of the above).\n\t- Filipino cultural values\n\t\t- Bahala na\n\t\t\t- Negative: Ganyan talaga ng buhay\n\t\t\t\t- Filipino resilience\n\t\t\t- Positive: risk taking; radical imagination?\n\t\t- relate to our acceptance of the status quo a.k.a. technological inequity\n\t\t\t- connect to digital justice perception survey\n\t- Design\n\t\t- Design for the unreal world\n\t\t\t- How might I use unreality to question the authority of a specific reality?\n\t\t- Liberatory Design\n\t\t\t- History is a series of design decisions\n\t\t\t- Systems produce what they were designed to produce.\n\t\t\t- Everything is by design.\n\t\t\t- We are ALL designers.\n\t\t- design justice\n\t\t\t- how does design reproduce and/or challenge inequities?\n\t\t\t- The point of this story is to provide a small but concrete example from my own daily lived experience of how ==larger systems‚Äî including norms, values, and assumptions‚Äî are encoded in and reproduced through the design of sociotechnical systems,==\n\t\t\t- Utopia v.s. dystopia\n\t\t\t\t- Popular narratives of design, technology, and social change are dominated by techno- utopian hype about ever- more- powerful per-sonal devices, ‚Äúintelligent‚Äù systems, and ‚ÄúTwitter revolutions,‚Äù on the one hand, and totalizing, pessimistic accounts of digital surveillance, disinformation, and algorithmic injustice, on the other.\n\t\t\t- My broader goal is to advance the growing conversation about the pitfalls and possibilities of design as a tool for social transformation.\n\t\t\t- designers need to explicitly identify disadvantage and oppression, call it out and act upon it. This requires designers to actively address issues of marginalisation and oppression in their designs:\n\t\t\t- The goal of this book is to ==spur our imaginations about how to move beyond a system of technology design largely orga-nized around the reproduction of the matrix of domination.==\n\t\t- ¬†Anti-Oppressive Design\n\t\t\t- an approach that considers both the values embedded in technological design and the environment that surrounds how a technology is built and researched.\n\t\t\t- Aorta Collective‚Äôs Iceberg of Oppression ![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20221206233725.png]]\n\t\t\t- By visiting the Hollaback site, the women were able to ==problematize their experiences.== By reading each others stories, they were able to u==nderstand harassment as a problem, rather than as a norm.== Usually, problematizing an issue is the work of social movement leaders‚Äîin this case, the ==stories were doing the transformation.==\n\t\t\t- This is called a \"frame transformation,‚Äù a cognitive and emotional shift in how people understood and felt about their experiences.\n\t- My personal experiences with tech\n\t\t- ive written about maintenance work, fast food education, and web3\n\t\t- from engaging with tech communities to interning and freelancing for companies\n\t- cite PH tech issues? affects of colonialism and capitalism\n\t\t- The Philippines as a hub for providing human capital: BPO industry and digital platforms -\u003e labor inequalities\n\t\t\t- digital colonialism (see Make Space for Maintenance and [[Miscellaneous Notes/Daily Notes/2022-10-30]])\n\t\t- reliance on foreign technologies and software, affected by foreign-oriented economic policies \n\t\t- sweaty startup guy\n\t\t\t- https://twitter.com/sweatystartup/status/1480161176797552640\n\t- Examples\n\t\t- Digital Justice Perception Survey\n\t\t\t- despite users professing to be literate, their actions say otherwise (i.e. carelessness with social media usage)\n\t\t- The Missing Economy of the Philippines\n\t\t\t- the most prominent tech firms that are operating in today's landscape are not founded and headquartered in the Philippines E.G. e-commerce\n\t\t\t- monopoly problem\n\t\t\t\t- even though we may have our own disruptive businesses, they are still far from changing the status quo of who is rich. Conglomerates still reign\n\t\t\t\t- e.g. prominent fintech players like GCash and Maya\n\t\t\t- the PH is a crypto-attached nation\n\t\t\t\t- some of the highest adopters of crypto coins, and largest players of crypto-based games like Axie Affinity\n\t\t- History of Philippine digitalization\n\t\t\t- The lost momentum to industrialize, along with economic policies that are foreign-oriented, caused the Philippines to become dependent on the service industry. The lack of national industry and grand political plan to do so lead the Philippine ICT to be highly reliant on foreign technologies and software which has a negative impact on the pace of current digitalization in the Philippines.\n\t\t- Digital labor bayanihan\n\t\t\t-  example of a Filipino cultural value that shapes the collective ‚Äúanchoring‚Äù of digital platform workers to survive a precarious digital market. \n\t\t\t- Digital labor influencers also serve as promoters of the Philippine government‚Äôs vision of promoting Filipinos as ‚Äúworld class workers‚Äù (imaginary) while allowing it (along with digital platforms) to avoid its responsibility to attend to the deeper structures of labor inequality.\n\t\t- Student Startup Ecosystem studies\n\t\t\t- For many Filipino students, dream career prospects end at Accenture (now with several offices across the Philippines) or at multinational pharmaceutical companies. While there is a growing entrepreneurial culture, tech isn't associated with the majority of small businesses--the startup scene is still rudimentary. For students, the lack of role models and introduction to alternative career prospects from the dominant monopolies, contributing to lack of entrepreneurial talent.\n\t\t\t- When technology is powered by the few, what happens?\n\t\t\t\t- In its current state, emerging markets must reject the same mistakes that Silicon Valley had welcomed in to invest in their own growth. Regulators and policymakers must step in to help local economies flourish, while also putting constraints on technologists. Cross-pollinators and¬†balikbayans¬†must be wary of tech saviourism and 'heropreneurship', especially when entirely unaware that the practices they parrot from Silicon Valley will few times suffice in their home country. While success breeds more success in the near-term, understanding the cultural and long-term impact of the products and economic models we breed is critical‚Äì‚Äìand we already have years of development ahead to forewarn us.\n\t\t\t- Idol worship\n\t\t\t- bayanihan seen in the community building of grassroots technology nonprofits and community organizers\n- Objectives of the Project\n\t- after listing the objectives, write paragraphs breaking down each one\n\t- perhaps explain how my tracks (information design and comptuer science)\n\t- Main question ideas:\n\t\t- How can we foster Filipinos' critical consciousness of technology? So that we can encourage a more equitable technological future for the Philippines? \n\t\t- How can we spur  Filipino imaginations about how to move beyond inequitable technological presents?\n\t\t- How can we cultivate Filipinos' critical questioning of technology through design?\n\t\t\t- How can we cultivate Filipinos' critical inquiry competence of technology?\n\t\t- How can we trigger critical thinking in Filipinos when it comes to technology?\n\t\t- How can we build Filipinos' critical consciousness about technological futures?\n\t\t- Solution: through a design provocation\n\t- Critical consciousness\n\t\t- Critical consciousness calls attention to how learning involves an awareness of understanding how inequality operates in society, including its structural roots, and the agency to engage in action toward social transformation. \n- Definition of Terms\n\t- a set of beliefs, institutions, laws, and symbols common to a particular social group and its corresponding society.

The evolving digital cultures in the Global South vividly demonstrate that there are more ways than one to imagine what digital practice and global connection could look like.\n\t- a powerful overview of the ways that technological innovation often happens on the margins of society, far from the inno-vation hubs imagined and created by city planners, state officials, and private sector investors. She describes how digital cultures that emerge organically from the peripheries, including in the Global South, are different from those produced via the universalizing imaginary of tech-nosolutionists who operate from positions of great power.\n\t- What work do universalisms do? That is how do they shape our understanding of networks and more broadly social, political and cultural change? Chan suggests that ==the way¬†**digital futures**¬†are imagined, narrated and created‚Äîthrough assumptions about innovation, progress, technologies agency ‚Äì are limited by these universal attributes and affordances of technology.==\n\t- To disrupt these, she posits an ethnographic methodology that emphasize ‚Äúvibrant micronarratives and situated stories around ==IT and innovation culture==‚Äù (xi) Specifically she wants to chart how these unhinge grand narratives of progress that are the foundation of these universalisms around technology. She examines how information technologies have become a shorthand for ‚Äúimagining global connection‚Äù (xiii) and in doing so seeks to undo the ‚Äúcontext-erasing‚Äù (5) accounts that have so far been the dominant trend in studies of global networks and information technologies.\n\t- ‚Äúthe imaginaries and innovations that underpin digital culture and surround networked connections‚Äù\n\t- The¬†**‚Äúmyth of digital universalism‚Äù**¬†manifests not only in the means by which it¬†**keeps public narratives and imaginations fixed exclusively**¬†**around**¬†so-called¬†**‚Äúcentres‚Äù of innovation**, but in the means by which it¬†**simultaneously discourages attention to digital dynamics**¬†beyond such centres‚Äîa dynamic conjuring colonial relations to data and the periphery that reporters and scholars of global digital cultures alike must be wary of reproducing.\n\t- Global imaginaries around IT in the new millennium, after all, have made Silicon Valley hackers, the obsessions and aspirations of high-tech engineers, and the strategic enterprise of competitive technology entrepreneurs, the stuff of popular Hollywood films and obsessively followed Twitter accounts. These are a cast of increasingly recognizable actors, heroes and villains.\n\t- Far from merely lagging behind or mimicking centres, dynamic activities from the periphery suggest how¬†**agents once holding minor status can emerge**¬†instead as fresh sources of distinct productivity. Their diverse threads unsettle the unspoken presumption that a single, universal narrative could adequately represent the distinct digital futures and imaginaries emerging across a range of local sites today\n\t- ‚Äúdigital universalist‚Äù models (Chan, 2014) that ==problematically elevate narrow versions of Western and elite digital practice and innovation as the only relevant pathway to the future==\n\t- Imagining technological futures withand in between the interfaces of the diverse forms of knowledge practice that come alive among them ‚Äìand that can come together across differences, rather than in spite of it ‚Äìinstead becomes a key resource for imagining new digital futures (Tsing, 2005).\n- Sustainable Technological Futures: Moving beyond a One-World-World perspective\n\t- In this critique, we ==problematize the framing of technological futures== in design and computing discourse through rhetorical devices such as the Futures Cone which we contend promotes a one-world-world perspective, in that it assumes a ==collective (western) acceptance of a particular historicity and notions of time and progress.== This perspective currently dominates the practical design and implementation of many new technological devices and systems.\n- Problematize cont.\n\t- Abstract 2 points towards the necessity of AI systems to provide meaningful explanations for their behavior and that currently ‚Äúexplanations are predominantly implemented after the fact.‚Äù Concerning this matter, the authors problematize ‚Äútechno-centric engineering processes and development teams that lack diversity and empathy.‚Äù\n- https://www.academia.edu/39021258/The_limits_of_the_imaginary_Challenges_to_raising_critical_consciousness_about_datafication_and_algorithmic_archiving\n\t- encourage people to imagine future possibilites\n\t- challenge: getting people to actually imagine in ways that do not reproduce current ideological trends or cede control/power to external stakeholders\n\t- hegemonic ideology of pwoer and control\n\t- goals:\n\t\t- to penetrate and disrupt both learned and tacit frames\n\t\t- to enable people to start thinking critically\n\t\t- to build new pathways for thinking\n\t- ACS functions\n\t\t- First, to ask participants to think about ==‚ÄòWhat is going on here?‚Äô== in relation to how their data is being formulated, stored, and fed back to them through various platforms and digital service infrastructures. This question (What is going on here?) is not stated as much as it is ==provoked==, which means essentially that we want participants to raise the question themselves.\n\t\t- This more open-ended goal was accompanied by an interventionist, critical pedagogy goal, inspired by a second question, ==‚ÄòShouldn‚Äôt we be more engaged in actively creating rather than simply accepting the future?‚Äô== and ‚ÄòOn what level might we be actually ‚Äòworld-making‚Äô as we engage in the mundane, the banal, the playful acts of everyday conversation and digital media use? \n\t\t- Therefore, each workshop tested a different set of techniques to prompt participants to ==dig beneath the surface of activities to identify some of the implicit assumptions and premises informing these actions. And then build some imaginariesof their own.==\n\t\t\t- 1st objectives: dig deep to identify implicit assumptions and premises that inform their actions\n\t\t\t- 2nd objectives: surface these imaginaries through design\n\t\t- How can design interventions help push the limits of public imagination to think in truly alternative ways about their futures?\n- Critically Conscious Computing\n\t- Computer science (CS) is often taught as a utopian discipline, full of powerful abstractions that can transform lives and society for the better. However, as computing has reshaped every part of society in both highly visible and highly invisible ways, it has become clear that the foundational ideas in CS carry explicit values: ones of automation, replacement, standardization, centralization, and amplification. These values have positioned it as a discipline of power, and due to the ignorance with which it is often applied, often one of oppression. In this book, we reconsider the technical and pedagogical foundations of CS and CS education from this lens, and offer teaching methods for secondary education that ==foster students‚Äô critical consciousness of computing, with the hope of fostering a more equitable, culturally sustaining, and just future of computing.==\n\t- Introduction\n\t\t- CS teaching, therefore, naturally gravitates toward these utopian narratives.\n\t\t- This uncritical view of CS is far from just an incomplete story ‚Äî for many, it is becoming an invisible crisis of injustice and oppression.\n\t\t- Our focus is therefore adolescents, and on a counter narrative about computing that views CS as both magical, but also fraught. It simultaneously examines the racist, sexist, ableist, classist reality of our global society, and demonstrates how CS is often used to amplify and reinforce these forms of oppression in daily life. It shows how only certain people experience the utopian narrative of CS, and those that do go on to perpetuate this narrative in higher education and industry, systematically and often unintentionally excluding those who were never included. It positions students as agents of social change, both in how they use computing, but also in whether they use it, and to what end. This is a book for secondary CS educators who want to develop the agency and skills to ==catalyze social change though their students.==\n\t- CS, Equity, and Justice\n\t\t- Computing is not neutral; it is imbued with the values of its creators.\n\t\t- Teachers can build students‚Äô critical consciousness of computing, equity, and justice by linking the injustices in their lives to the technology in their lives.\n\t\t- Raising questions about how computing does harm is an opportunity to talk about more equal, equitable, and just futures, and reposition computing from a technology that is neutral or in the way, to a technology that might be harnessed for justice.\n- Apparudai on global cultural flows\n\t- the world we live in today is characterized by a new role for the imagination in social life\n\t- the imagination as social practice: an organized field of social practices, a forom of work, and a form of negotiation between sites of agency and globally defined fieds of possibilties\n\t- the imagination is now central to all forms of agency, is itself a social fact, and is the key component of the new global order\n- STEPWISE Science Education on Sociotechnical Imaginaries\n\t- This video is intended to be used by teachers to introduce students to the concept of sociotechnical imaginaries (SIs) - which are sets of values, principles, etc. that guide assemblage of many living and non-living actants into a dispositif (network of actants) that generally promotes said values, principles, etc. Such teaching can help students to more fully understand relationships among fields of science \u0026 technology and societies \u0026 environments (STSE) and sociopolitical actions to try to overcome harms in such relationships. \n\t- [Teacher Intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_kd8JXncRM)\n\t\t- Example SIs\n\t\t\t- ![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20221206033555.png]]\n\t\t\t- ![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20221206033631.png]]\n\t\t\t- ![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20221206033655.png]]\n\t- [Teacher-Input](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxIQ1Povp_0)\n\t\t- Introduction ![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20221206032717.png]]\n\t\t- Case Study on Lumosity\n\t\t\t- ![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20221206032935.png]]\n\t\t\t- ![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20221206033218.png]]\n\t- [Teacher Input \u0026 Student Applications](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXfP3YnAIaI)\n\t\t- The problem ![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20221206034418.png]]\n\t\t- Emotions as stakeholders ![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20221206034510.png]]\n\t\t- ![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20221206034717.png]]\n\t\t- ![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20221206034753.png]]\n\t\t- ![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20221206034824.png]]\n\n\n\u003e This talk will address the potential for the imaginary as a design tool for social change.

Sorry for not getting back to you these past few months. I've been delayed by a lot of difficulties in my personal life, along with excruciating perfectionism; it took me forever to not only figure out what topic I wanted to share, but also select the best resources to feature. I hope the effort I put into answering these questions makes up for it, though! Thank you again for the opportunity :)\n\n### Questions\n**Topic Name:**\n- Non-Western Product and Service Design\n- Or Cross-Cultural Design\n\n**Why is XX topic interesting?**¬†(100-150 words)\nWhen I was getting started with product and service design, I was stuck in a Western bubble; the practitioners I first looked up to tended to be white males, while the platforms I would refer to as examples usually came from Silicon Valley.  However, design isn't fully universal; just because an app succeeds in America doesn't mean it'll do as well in Southeast Asia. A significant chunk of Internet users belong to the Majority World/Global South, yet there is so little we know about them. As a Filipino woman myself, I struggled to figure out how to adapt my design practice to my own local context, and I feel like I'm still learning. Hence why I want to advocate for this topic. I have compiled resources on how to practice cross-cultural design alongside various examples of technology in non-Western countries.\n  \n\n**A podcast worth listening to on the topic?**¬†¬†(with 1-2 sentences on why)\nI highly recommend [Traces](https://open.spotify.com/show/29LXWjJOJoBmaEaMevtvi6?si=1179809d99bf41ce): a podcast that dissects how technology and design impacts culture in developing countries (currently focused on Myanmar).\n\n**Things worth reading and watching on the topic?**¬†(with 1-2 sentences on why)\nFirst, here are some of the books I find essential:\n- [Cross-Cultural Design](https://abookapart.com/products/cross-cultural-design): Designer and creative director Senongo Akpem shares a clear and accessible methodology for designing across cultures: from performing socially conscious research, to building culturally responsive experiences, to developing meaningful internationalization and localization approaches.\n- [The Next Billion Users](https://www.amazon.com/Next-Billion-Users-Digital-Beyond/dp/0674983785): Digital anthropologist Payal Arora invalidates  multiple assumptions about internet use in developing countries by sharing insights from her extensive fieldwork in India, China, South Africa, Brazil, and the Middle East.\nNext, here are some of the online resources I constantly refer to:\n- [Web Design Across the World](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/series/web-design-across-the-world--cms-1038):  This series of articles exposes global web culture, technology, education, and design, one country at a time.\n- [Inclusive Design in Southeast Asia](https://www.projectlima.co/inclusive-design-southeast-asia/): This study explores how far Southeast Asia organizations incorporate inclusiveness and accessibility¬†into their digital products.\nFinally, a case study that has left a big impact on me is [Designing for Developing Markets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unCYqNmg7tI): a talk where Jay Demetillo, Lead Product Designer of Grab, shows how he strategizes, researches, and designs for different regions, discussing everything from ideologies to design systems.\n\t\n**Projects worth following on the topic?**¬†(with 1-2 sentences on why)\nTwo projects that I'm excited by so far are:\n- [Chamjo](https://chamjo.design/): Created by an all-Indonesian team, this Mobbin-inspired collection consists of design patterns used by Asia-based apps. \n- [AI in/from the Majority World](https://points.datasociety.net/ai-in-the-global-south-sites-and-vocabularies-e3b67d631508): This project by Data \u0026 Society invigorates existing efforts to reframe the \"Global South\" as home to the majority of the human population, while aiming to understand the diverse ethics, politics, and everyday experiences of living with data and AI. So far, this project has come up with a primer on various jargons and an anthology of parables. \n\nAside from these, I have also gained unique insights from the following publications:\n- [Rest of World](https://restofworld.org/): a global nonprofit publication covering technology beyond the Western bubble.\n- [Chaoyang Trap](https://chaoyangtrap.house/): a newsletter about everyday life on the Chinese internet\n\n\n\n### Dump\n- 99% Invisible\n\t- Person in Lotus Position\n\t- \"Big Ear\" Phone Shelters - Brazil\n\t- Balikbayan Boxes - Philippines\n- Publications\n\t- Kontinentalist\n\t\t- https://kontinentalist.com/stories/air-conditioning-in-southeast-asia-is-worsening-climate-change\n\t\t- https://kontinentalist.com/stories/covid-fake-news-and-social-media-in-asia\n\t\t- https://kontinentalist.com/stories/how-online-delivery-in-asia-hurts-essential-workers-and-the-environment\n\t- Rest of World\n\t\t- https://restofworld.org/2021/the-revolutionary-mission-to-decolonize-chinese-typefaces/\n\t\t- https://restofworld.org/2020/rebuilding-gaza-with-minecraft/\n\t\t- Tech Markets: https://restofworld.org/series/tech-markets/\n- Designing a super app for the cultural diversity across southeast Asia: In this talk, Keith Vaz, Manyu Varma, and Ronak Mokashi from Gojek talks through their journey of building an umbrella brand, a cohesive design system for 20+ products, and the lessons they‚Äôve learned along the way.\n- Designing for healthcare in India: In this talk, Daniel and Mahima of Simple discuss their UX approach, prototyping and testing, and how they‚Äôve succeeded so far in helping 1.8 million people with chronic disease to get better care.\n- [Kontinenalist](https://www.kontinentalist.com/): publication creating simple, powerful data stories about Asia.\n- Technology of the Oppressed\n- Networking Peripheries\n\n- [Between the Binary](https://open.spotify.com/show/6MW2vnMh50ppvZPIwfxEj5):¬†  This limited series podcast highlights the priorities, prospects, and challenges of technology in the Global South through the voices of experts in and from the Global South.\n- [Next Billion Users](https://nextbillionusers.google/research/): This global user research initiative by Google aims to investigate more on what people everywhere need to effectively navigate the internet (not associated with Arora's book).","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.731605397Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2023-01-25":{"title":"2023-01-25","content":"## Historical and Philosophical Foundations of Education: Education in Ancient Times\n#EDUC101i #education #history #philosophy \n### Framing History\nWhen reviewing history, it's quite easy to get lost in the details, most specially when you are reviewing years and/or decades worth of documentation. Therefore, it's often helpful to know what you are looking for. In this course, we will review the following features in each of the eras that we will investigate:\n- **üéØ AIM:** pertains to the underlying ==purpose, philosophy or ideology== of education. *What is the purpose of education? What was education for?*\n- **üè´ TYPE:** refers to the ==various forms== in which education appears within a ==given society or culture== (e.g., moral instruction, vocational training, physical education, military or civic training). *What were the formal and/or informal types of education present?*\n- **üìñ CONTENT:** emphasizes the ==selection of traditions, experiences, learnings, skills, crafts, or group activities thought to be valuable within a culture== and made the basis for formal or informal education. *What was included/excluded in the the types of education?*\n- **üë®‚Äçüè´üë™ AGENCY:** pertains to the ==specific influence== of the clan, the tribe or nation, the home (including parental instruction), the church or other religious orientation, apprenticeship, the formal school, or the society itself. *Who were the \"influencers\" of education in that time?*\n- **üéì ORGANIZATION:** refers to the ==various gradations, and age levels== within the educational system. *How was education organized?*\n- **üôãMETHOD:** includes the ==devices, procedures, or direction== of the formal school as well as the more ==informal influences of society, culture, or politics.== *How did education happen?*\n\n### Education in Ancient China\n#### Geography Matters\n##### Geography as Context\n- One way to understand an educational system is to investigate the **context** that brought about its development. One way to investigate context is to begin by looking at **geography**. \n- How do you think China's geography helped \"map out\" (pun intended) its educational system?\n- Video: https://youtu.be/TSp3DeNdDzU\n\t-  What can you say about the geography of China?\n\t- How do you think did China's geographic features influence or define its educational system?\n\t- How about the Philippines? Do you think that our educational system is influenced by our geography? Why? Why not? (If you answered no, what would be changes in our educational system if it were?)\n\n##### China: Molding the future upon the past\nThe previous  video illustrates how contextual factors influence the different facets of  an educational system.  The geographic features of China ==isolated== it from other regions. Consequently, the Chinese became ==self-sufficient== and learned to ==value collectivism.==\n\n###### One of the First \"Influencers\"\n- The concept of education in ancient China was mostly based on the teaching and writings of Confucius (Links to an external site.), a leader, philosopher, teacher and political figure. Therefore, one of the best ways to understand Ancient Chinese Education is to understand where Confucius is coming from.\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFt_VGG0kJU\n\t- In a warring world, Confucius exemplified benevolence and integrity.\n\t- Because of his difficult circumstances (i.e. father dying early, having to support disabled family), Confucius developed a lifelong sympathy for the suffering of the common people.\n\t- Confucius was inspired by ancient relics, even if they were considered by many as irrelevant.\n\t- He came to believe that human character is formed in the family and by education in ritual, literature, and history. A person cultivated in this way works to help others, guiding them by moral inspiration rather than brute force.\n\t- He struggled to find a ruler who aligned with his morals. In accordance with his philosophy, and contrary to the practice of the time, Confucius dissuaded rulers from relying on harsh punishments and military power to govern their lands. This is because he believed that a good leader inspires others to spontaneously follow him by virtue of his ethical charisma.\n\t- Confucius also believed that because the love and respect we learn in the family are fundamental to all other virtues, personal duties to family sometimes supersede obligations to the state.\n\t- Despite the struggles he went through, he believed that heaven had a plan for the world, and that a person could always find joy in learning and music.\n\t- \"Do not inflict upon others that which you yourself would not want.\"\n- **üéØ AIM: What was the Aim of Ancient Chinese Education?**\n\t- Education in Ancient China was aimed to preserve and perpetuate ==traditional beliefs, customs and way of life.== The Chinese believed that education was an instrument to secure ==social stability== by \"preserving the past\".   Hence, ideals and beliefs were the same from generation to generation. Life was crystallized in fixed forms. \n\t- Another  important educational aim in ancient China was to prepare its citizen for the [civil examination](https://www.ancient.eu/article/1335/the-civil-service-examinations-of-imperial-china/).  Being successful in these examinations provided opportunities for positions in government as well as achieving a higher status in life.\n- **üè´ TYPE: What was the type of education?**\n\t- To support these educational aims, ==moral training== was given emphasis.  Moral training  did not refer to right or wrong (as we know it now) but rather to the idea of of noble living.  \n\t- Noble living meant valuing the [five relationships](https://prezi.com/33o0lrhkpeow/the-five-relationships/) and following the [five cardinal virtues](http://www.goolevalve.com/news/news-detail-195.html). Vocational and domestic training were also highly valued.  Boys were taught trade skills while domestic skills were developed among the girls. \n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23095578/214774293-50d83833-acb6-4333-838a-0534efdc0457.png)\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23095578/214770589-12359c1e-d16b-4c93-8d2a-85659e163932.png)\n\n- **üìñ CONTENT**\n\t- The content of education were the [Five Classics and the Four Books](https://academics.hamilton.edu/asian_studies/home/culttemp/sitePages/fiveclassics.html).  These writings were the main content of the examinations. In the examinations, students had to show that they've memorized these texts.\n\nIn the text above, I gave you a head start by providing an overview of the aims, type and content of Ancient Chinese Education. How about üë®‚Äçüè´üë™ AGENCY, üéì ORGANIZATION and üôãMETHOD?\n- To dig deeper into how Ancient Chinese Education was like, read p.21-28 of this excerpt on Ancient Chinese Education:\n\t- AIMS\n\t- AGENCIES\n\t- ORGANIZATION\n\t\t- organized on 2 levels: (1) elementary education, exceedingly formalized and rigorous; and (2) higher education, training for the governmental tests, which formed the highest stage of the educational process\n\t\t- started at age 7\n\t\t- \"leap through the Dragon's Gate\" = gaining of  high public office through examinations and degrees; could be bestowed upon both poor and wealthy \n\t\t- Ancient Chinese education was designed for the maintenance of that which exists, without change or modification, it became the function of education to train the leaders in the knowledge of the classical learning ‚Äî all the traditional rules governing the order of society and covering the popular relationships in life ‚Äî and to train the masses in proper modes of conduct with respect to every interest and every activity throughout their entire lives.\n\t- TYPES\n\t- CONTENT \n- To aid in imagining what this might have been like, you may also want to view this [short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_ukxlUlGyI).\t\n\n###### Read and Share\n\u003e After going over the materials above, share your answers to the following questions in the Discussion Board.  Limit your answers to two to three sentences for each question.\n\u003e 1. What is the Chinese concept of learning?\n\u003e 2. What factors affected educational opportunities in China?\n\n1. The Chinese equated the act of learning to memorization. This is because the morals they aspired to develop in their educational system were merely seen as a matter of knowledge; after all, truth is what has simply been agreed on in the past, and virtue was an observance of those fixed ideas and customs. This perception is reflected in exceedingly formalized education and reliance on classical readings.\n2. Some factors that affected educational opportunities in China were gender and socioeconomic class. Private schools and public examinations were only open to males, but preparation for these examinations required much leisure time that only those of higher classes could afford to spend.\n\n##### Ancient Chinese Education Today\n- Now that you have a better grasp of what Ancient Chinese Education may have been like, let's make some connections to present day practice.\n- [Education for children on Chinese traditional culture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSVMzBFRhsQ)\n\t- The video above shows how ancient educational practices are still given premium in contemporary education in China.¬†¬†_If we look beyond China, do we also see a semblance of such practices?

In a nutshell, it's a genre defined by¬†**fictional elements that are rooted in scientific principles while still being impossible according to our current understanding and/or deployment of those principles**, but even this definition comes with caveats and ambiguity. Whose science are we using? What does \"impossible\" mean? How much can we bend scientific theory before we leave science fiction altogether and enter the realm of fantasy?\n- This is not a course whose goal is to give you definitive answers to any of those questions. This is a course founded on appreciation, discussion, and critique, which means ==treating gray areas not as problems to be solved, but as territory to be explored==.\n- Historically, science fiction has many ancestors, chief among them ==mythology==--the stories used by ancient civilizations to attempt to explain the workings of the universe. While we now refer to these as fantastical narratives, to ancient peoples, these were the result of earnest, rational striving using the tools they had at the time in order to ==explain phenomena for which they had no definitive answers==--in short, early forerunners of science and science fiction. \n- Later on, as ==political, utopia, and enlightenment stories== emerged throughout human history, they too displayed characteristics we now associate with science fiction, centering such concepts as ==alternative visions of society== and the ==primacy of human reason== in shaping and understanding the world.\n- One important thing to remember is that¬†**science fiction stories are as much about the present as they are about the future.**¬†Science fiction exists at the ==intersection of possibility and critique:== we imagine it out of our dreams of the future as much as we extrapolate it from the realities of the present. When Orwell wrote¬†_1984_, he was both speculating on how technology might enable a government to spy on and control its people as much as he was commenting on the surveillance state that already existed in the United States as he was writing. This can inflect science fiction with hope and darkness in equal parts: the bright spots we see in the present, as well as the problems, can all be amplified and hyperbolized through the lens of future society and technology.\n- The perspective of science fiction, thus, is that ==we carry our present into the future.== ==Reason and human agency and causality==, not destiny or prophecy or the associative logic of magic, are the driving engines of reality; science fiction holds that ==the universe can be understood, that history makes sense, and that logic is the ordering principle of narrative== (even if it's a logic we do not currently understand).\n\n#### Darko Suvin: \"On the Poetics of the Science Fiction Genre\"\n- Suvin's definition of science fiction hinges on two key descriptors.\n\t- First, he describes science fiction as a genre that¬†**\"takes off from a ==fictional (‚Äòliterary‚Äô) hypothesis ==and develops it with ==extrapolating and totalizing (‚Äòscientific‚Äô) rigor.==\"**¬†\n\t\t- Science fiction asks the question¬†_**what if**_, creates hypotheses that bear some kind of ==social, cultural, or symbolic resonance== (e.g. \"what if capitalism literally forced you to buy more years of life\"--see the 2011 film¬†_In Time_), grounds these hypotheses in ==scientific logic== (e.g. \"capitalism forcing you to buy years of life is possible if humanity is genetically engineered a certain way), and then builds its stories from these premises. \n\t\t- At the heart of a great science fiction story is a ==resonant (\"literary\") idea==, built up with the ==logic of currently understood science== and turned into the engine of a narrative.\n\t- Suvin further writes that ‚Äúthe effect of such factual reporting of fictions is one of¬†**confronting a set normative system‚Ä¶ with a point of view or glance implying a new set of**¬†**norms.**\" \n\t\t- Here, the \"set normative system\" is the ==\"real world,\"== the context in which the author and reader live and which the text inhabits. \n\t\t- Every fantastic fact in science fiction is an implied ==critique of reality==--if you make the sky pink on your alien planet, you implicitly ask why the sky we see¬†_isn't_¬†pink. \n\t\t- When we see a¬†_kaiju_¬†like Godzilla or a fictional alien invasion like the zerg from Starcraft, we ask ourselves how we as a society actually would react to this kind of catastrophic disaster (spoilers for the year 2020: apparently not well). \n\t\t- More realistically, a world of social control like that of Margaret Atwood's¬†_The Handmaid's Tale_¬†asks questions like, \"_**What if the sex-and-gender-based social systems that control our lives were somehow even worse and had more concrete physical manifestations?\"**_\n- Suvin anchors all this on what he terms the¬†**_[[Cards/Novum]]_**, the \"strange newness\" at the heart of a science fiction work. The¬†_novum_¬†is¬†**the fantastic element of a text, the point of difference between a science fiction text and the reality in which the text exists.**¬†\n\t- A work can, of course, have multiple¬†_nova_, ranging from people to creatures to technology to places to physical laws and phenomena. \n\t- The¬†_novum_¬†follows the logic of science fiction: in a good science fiction story, the¬†_novum_¬†has a \"literary\" resonance--it carries a kind of social, cultural, or symbolic meaning with it--but exists in the world of the story through scientific logic and rules. \n\t- When we see Godzilla, we think of a metaphor for the atom bomb, a wild force of power and destruction, but he exists in the world of the text as a mutant creature, an accident of genetics. And the best science fiction stories ==portray the metaphorical and logical sides of the¬†_novum_¬†as in harmony with each other==: Godzilla is mutated, usually, by radiation from the atom bomb, so even in the world of the text, he is the embodied power of the weapon that he represents.\n- Suvin also goes on to talk about two other principles at work in the science fiction text:¬†**[[Cards/Cognition]]**¬†and¬†**[[Cards/Estrangement]].**¬†\n\t- [[Cards/Cognition]] is our ==understanding== of something, the textual representation of our ability to recognize the ==meaning== in a symbol. \n\t- [[Cards/Estrangement]], conversely, is the ==portrayal== of something in a way that renders it ==bizarre or alien== to us (one might also call it¬†_defamiliarization_). \n\t- When we look at the¬†_novum_, or indeed at any fantastic element in speculative fiction,¬†**both cognition and estrangement**¬†are at work: we can ideally recognize what the¬†_novum_¬†represents, both in terms of symbolic meaning and scientific principle, but we can also see the ways in which the work renders it fantastic, scary, wondrous, and unreal. The creative tension between cognition and estrangement is what drives science fiction--in terms of individual text, genre as a whole, and our experience of both--forward.\n\n#### Evolution as the Framework for Science Fiction\n\u003e \"Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution.\"\n\u003e -Theodosius Dobzhansky\n\n- ^ This will be our guiding principle throughout the whole course\n- Just as evolutionary concepts inform biological studies, so do they inform the understanding of science fiction texts with biological nova.\n- [Episode 1 - Biology of Science Fiction: Cosmic Red Queen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xda7O-Fie6A)\n\t- Red Queen in *Alice in Wonderland:* \"Now, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place.\"\n\t- [[Cards/Red Queen Hypothesis]]: **a species must adapt and evolve not just for reproductive advantage, but also for survival because competing organisms also are evolving**.\n\t- [[Cards/Evolutionary Arms Race]]: an ongoing struggle between¬†[competing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_(biology) \"Competition (biology)\")¬†sets of¬†[co-evolving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co-evolution \"Co-evolution\")¬†[genes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene \"Gene\"),¬†[phenotypic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotypic \"Phenotypic\")¬†and¬†[behavioral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_ecology \"Behavioral ecology\")¬†traits that develop escalating¬†[adaptations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation_(biology) \"Adaptation (biology)\")¬†and counter-adaptations against each other, resembling an¬†[arms race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arms_race \"Arms race\")\n- [Gunn - The Worldview of Science Fiction](https://www.proquest.com/openview/0037939df3181bd1f1399860ed428ef2/1?pq-origsite=gscholar\u0026cbl=1820923)\n\t- Gunn proposes a¬†worldview¬†of¬†science¬†fiction¬†that is based on¬†the¬†premise that humanity is adaptable. Humans have¬†the¬†intellectual ability to choose a course other than that instilled by their environment.\n\t- Four principles:\n\t\t- The universe is knowable\n\t\t- Humans are adaptable\n\t\t\t- As humans encounter new stimuli, they grow and change in order to incorporate the new stimuli. Denial of change is characterized as a backward attitude in science fiction. Certainly the good old days, the period of time prior to change, can be appreciated, but science fiction, in its forward-thinking attitude, will recognize that the good old days were never really that good and that change is necessary for growth of the species.\n\t\t\t- Humans can overcome their natural instincts and responses to stimulus\n\t\t- Does not overly concern itself with characterization\n\t\t- The focus in a science fiction plot will be on external events and the repercussions of those events\n\n**Points for Discussion:**\n1) How are Suvin's and Gunn's ideas on the science fiction genre consistent with each other? How are they conflicting?\n2) Think of a science fiction text (i.e. book, movie, anime, TV show, comics, etc.) that you know. How does evolution inform its main plot and/or characters?\n3) In her Introduction to her novel¬†_The Left Hand of Darkness, Ursula Le Guin says that \"Science fiction is not predictive; it is descriptive.\" Is this consistent with how you view science fiction? How do you relate it to Suvin's and Gunn's definitions of the genre?\n\n#### Semiotics and the Novum\n- Science fiction as a genre is highly driven by signs and symbols. We can look at Ferdinand de¬†Saussure's definition of a¬†**sign**¬†as a system of meaning consisting of a constructed relationship between a¬†**signifier**¬†(the physical form of a sign which communicates meaning) and a¬†**signified**¬†(the abstract meaning/s being communicated). \n- Because these relationships are constructed and based upon ==convention==, a signifier can have many meanings, and often we have to parse them through ==context==--the color¬†**red**¬†can be seen to represent¬†_health_¬†if seen on an apple,¬†_love_¬†if combined with the shape of an abstract cartoon heart, or¬†_caution or attention_¬†if perceived in the context of the octagon of a stop sign. We can then say that a¬†**stop sign**¬†is a¬†**sign**¬†that uses the color¬†**red**¬†as a¬†**signifier**¬†to communicate¬†**caution and attention**¬†as¬†**signified**¬†meanings. (Although it must be said that by now, the image of the stop sign is so ingrained in many of us that the signified meaning is pretty much just \"stop.\")\n- Darko Suvin's¬†_nova_¬†can be interpreted in much the same way in terms of how they operate within science fiction texts. Through the dynamics of¬†_cognition and estrangement_, a¬†_novum_¬†often ==represents a concept from reality (the signified) that is twisted into an often-literally-alien form (the signifier).== In a good science fiction work (i.e. one that integrates the¬†_novum_¬†as a core part of the text's discourse rather than simply using it as window dressing), it's often a good strategy to begin reading the work by trying to figure out what meaning/s the¬†_novum_¬†is attempting to communicate.\n- For example, the¬†**zombie,**¬†a classic monster in movies and popular culture, is often explained as the product of a virus or other infectious agent when it's in a science fiction text. The zombie virus, then, is the¬†_novum_, the science-based fictional element that makes the text a work of science fiction. \n\t- Now, depending on the specific text, zombies are often used to represent all manner of things: zombie movies set in malls often cast their zombies as mindlessly ravenous hordes against a backdrop of consumer goods, suggesting a reading based on consumerism's ability to drive us mad. \n\t- Conversely, a zombie movie where the protagonists explore a post-apocalyptic wilderness or urban landscape tends to create the feeling that the zombies involved are stand-ins for humanity in survival mode, the loss of humanity that can occur in desperate situations.\n\t- In this formulation, the¬†**sign**¬†is the¬†_novum_, the¬†**zombie plague**. \n\t- The¬†**signifier**, the concrete container and conveyor of meaning, is the science-based element of a¬†**pathogen**. \n\t- The¬†**signified**, the abstract theme/s or ideas/s that the signifier is made to represent, is¬†**consumerism or desperation--the fear of the other--**or whatever it is that the film in question wants its zombies to stand for.\n![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20230127133229.png]]\n\n- In short, a good starting point for reading a piece of science fiction might be to begin by identifying the¬†_novum_, and then trying to articulate it using a formulation like, \"The¬†_novum_¬†in this text is¬†**[sign]**, which uses¬†**[scientific grounding]**¬†as a signifier to communicate or represent¬†**[social/cultural theme/s and/or idea/s]**¬†as a signified.\" \n- It's important to note that there is even less direct correspondence of meanings between signifier and signified when we speak of the science fiction¬†_novum_¬†than there is for other signs; the metaphorization present in science fiction necessarily loses some of the meaning of the signified even as it hyperbolizes and clarifies other aspects of it. The point of science fiction is ==never to completely reproduce anything==--whether it's science or the abstract themes that it's using science to discuss--but rather to ==make us think about and appreciate the ways in which scientific theories and our conceptions about society, culture, and philosophy can inform and comment upon each other.==\n- One final note: the reason I hate the word \"symbolize\" is because it's so easy to overuse. Remember, ==a metaphor is when¬†_unlike_¬†things are compared to one another with the intention of making a point.== If a movie shows humans attacking aliens with missiles, you cannot say the missiles \"symbolize hostility\"--they're a direct consequence of hostility. Not everything is a symbol, and indeed, not every theme in a science fiction text is a direct result of its¬†_novum_¬†or¬†_nova_. Don't be too trigger-happy with your analyses.\n\n#### Language and Biology\n- One very common source of curiosity regarding non-human animals is whether or not they have or are even capable of¬†**language**. \n\t- It's interesting to note at this juncture that one way by which human language has been distinguished from other animals' modes of communication is that it is the ability to routinely invent new signs or words. That is not to say, of course, that other animals cannot read and understand signs. \n\t- There are all sorts of visual, auditory, and tactile chemical cues that animals use to understand one another, like bright colors usually meaning danger! \n\t- It's just that ==only humans may be capable of routinely inventing new signs or new meanings to existing ones.==\n- Aside from that, human language has some properties that other forms of animal communication lack. According to linguistic anthropologist Charles F. Hockett, only human language has the following features: \n\t- **displacement**¬†(communicating things that are not present)\n\t- **productivity**¬†(creating new words to add to a language, specifically to its lexicon)\n\t- **cultural transmission**\n\t- **duality**¬†(consisting of individually meaningless elements that can together form larger meaningful elements, such as sounds together making up a complete word)\n\t- **prevarication**¬†(intentionally making false or meaningless statements),¬†**reflexiveness**¬†(using language to talk about language)\n\t- **learnability** \n\t- Other features such as arbitrariness and semanticity may be present in communication among other primates or to a certain extent other animals (like dolphins, which are believed to communicate through their clicks, including unique names for one another), but ==only human language has ALL of these properties.==\n- That other animals have some form of communication is, of course, undeniable. Ants and many other insects use chemical signals in the form of pheromones. Birds use their sounds and a combination of anatomical traits and behavior, such as fluffing their feathers, to transmit a message. Cuttlefish change the color of their skin to show aggression. So that leads us to the next oft-asked question concerning language: **is intelligence necessary for the type of language that we have?** What do we even mean by intelligence and \"intelligent species,\" which is a term that we often see in science fiction?\n\t- It's not necessarily an easy question to answer. Many have linked intelligence to cognition and consciousness. \n\t- The essence of¬†**[[Cards/Cognition]]**¬†can be captured by the ==capacity for perception, thinking, memory, learning, decision-making, problem-solving, self-control, and, perhaps most importantly,¬†_prediction_.== ^cec67f\n\t\t- It has been said that only humans have a concept of the future and planning for the future. However, some recent researches such as one done in Stockholm University have shown that planning and self-control behavior can be found in some animals like ravens and the great apes, and not because of similar high-level mental faculties as humans, but through associative learning.\n\t- _**Sir AJ's Note:**_¬†This is one point in the semester where we see an interesting point of interface between biology and literature--the way we see¬†_[[Cards/Cognition]]_.  ^13f4d0\n\t\t- While Suvin agrees with the biological perspective on cognition as the ability to perceive reality through logic, he also views ==cognition as an¬†_attitude_, an¬†_approach_¬†to reality that views reality as knowable, diametrically opposed to the approach of myth, which views the world's norms as fixed, mystical, and operating on associative/symbolic logic rather than rationality¬†_per se_.== \n\t\t- There's a lot to be said here about knowledge systems and the way knowledge is constructed and how the rhetoric and language of science has been used to marginalize other systems of knowledge, but I'll stop here lest we accidentally become an epistemology course.\n- Consciousness is closely linked to [[Cards/Cognition]]. According to the physicist and futurist Michio Kaku in his book¬†_The Future of the Mind_,¬†**[[Cards/Consciousness]]**¬†is the ability to create a model of the world using multiple feedback loops in different parameters to accomplish goals. The following table shows Kaku's categorization of levels of consciousness among organisms:\n\n![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20230127133811.png]]\n\n- One can assume that the more primitive vertebrates (fish and amphibians) belong to Level I as well, and birds, which have a well-developed limbic system (that part of the brain that governs emotions, long-term memory, motivation, etc.; the amygdala, which is associated with fear, is part of this system), also are of Level II. Presumably, by Kaku's categorization, invertebrates lie somewhere between Levels 0 and I, though I would argue that by virtue of their having a centralized nervous system and the ability to move, bilaterally symmetrical invertebrates (basically all invertebrates except sponges, jellyfish, corals, and their radially symmetrical kin) have Level I consciousness.\n- The prefrontal cortex is responsible for [[Cards/Cognition]] (thus the link between cognition and consciousness!), personality expression, and the moderation of behavior according to social norms (hold onto that; we'll revisit this when we read and discuss \"Love Will Tear Us Apart\" in Module 4). Interestingly, the brain part called the Broca's Area, which is linked to speech production, is associated with the prefrontal cortex.\n- So if language and cognition are hallmarks of intelligence, then we can say that ==\"intelligent species\" that are capable of human-like language (like Klingon, for instance) have Level III consciousness...or maybe even higher?== After all, some of the most hyper-intelligent alien species in sci-fi don't bother to use conventional language as we know it.\n\t- This sets up our first major text for this course, which is the brilliant film¬†_Arrival_¬†by Denis Villeneuve. Look back at the table and see that the parameter that Level III consciousness has as its playground is¬†_time_. That's going to be useful when discussing¬†_Arrival_'s Heptapods.\n\n#### *Arrival* - The Heptapods\n- _Arrival_¬†revolves around a first-contact scenario, with an enigmatic race of aliens making themselves known to humanity but being nearly impossible to understand, with Adams playing Louise Banks, a linguist recruited by the U.S. military to try to bridge the gap. The heart of the film is ultimately Louise's struggle to understand and be understood by the aliens, as well as the ripple effects this has on both her own life and the rest of the world's response to the situation.\n- Key to our understanding of¬†_Arrival_¬†is, of course, the aliens, termed heptapods by the film. The heptapods are mysterious seven-limbed aliens that look like crosses between hovering squid and gigantic hands; they lack facial features, humanity never really comes to understand the sounds they make, and their language consists of circular glyphs of ink projected by the heptapods onto the transparent glasslike walls that separate the heptapods in their ship from the human-safe \"guest chamber.\" They are, in short, a far cry from the stereotypical greys or little green men of typical science fiction stereotype; the heptapods are well and truly alien, in every sense of the word.\n\n![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20230127134650.png]]\n\n- Perhaps unsurprisingly, the heptapods themselves are the central¬†_novum_¬†of¬†_Arrival_; every other science fiction element in the film (their ships, their language, and so on) flows from them. When we read¬†_Arrival_¬†as a text, therefore, it makes sense that we must look at the design of the heptapods and their related¬†_nova_¬†in order to begin our reading of what ideas the film is trying to introduce as well as what it is trying to say about these ideas.\n\nLet's do a little close reading. In the comments section, respond to any of the following questions:\n1.  If we are to look at the heptapods as a¬†**sign,**¬†what do you think the¬†**signified**¬†is? What kind of abstract ideas and themes do you think their design is meant to communicate?\n2.  What¬†**signifiers**¬†do you think¬†_Arrival_¬†uses to communicate its ideas and themes? What aspects of the design of the heptapods, as well as their ships and language, do you believe are used to communicate the ideas you believe they stand for?\n3.  What can you say about¬†**Louise Banks**? How do her profession, actions, and overall plot and character arc serve to make a statement about the ideas you believe are signified by the film? Why, of all possible protagonists, is she our hero?\n4.  Discuss the heptapods' language as its own¬†_novum_¬†(a¬†_novum_¬†within a¬†_novum_!) in the context of semiotics and our discussion in the previous page of language, intelligence, cognition, and consciousness.\n\n#### Wonder, Critique, and Possibility\n- Science fiction, at its heart, is a genre rooted in ==possibility.== \n\t- That can be hopeful or it can be terrifying--as stated, science fiction is as much about wonder as it is about critique--but ultimately the philosophy that drives it forward is the ==belief that norms are changeable.== \n\t- It is possible to imagine a different universe with its own logic, and it is possible for the logic of a universe to change. Even when history is driven by patterns and cycles, human logic and will and agency have the power to change things, for better or for worse. \n\t- As Suvin writes, \"Significant modern SF‚Ä¶ discusses primarily¬†**the political, psychological, anthropological use and effect of sciences**, and philosophy of science, and¬†**the becoming or failure of new realities as a result of it**.‚Äù\n- What science fiction seeks, Suvin says, is¬†**‚Äúa hope of finding[,] in the unknown[,] the ideal environment, tribe, state, intelligence or other aspect of the Supreme Good (or to a fear of and revulsion from its contrary**.\" It is driven by the belief that ==in confronting the alien, we recognize something--or, conversely, that we can best confront what we know through delving into the unknown. ==\n\t- Frequently that has meant disaster--surely the 2020's do feel like the right time to take up all sorts of dark literature, be it disaster-driven or dystopian or even apocalyptic. But¬†_apocalypse_¬†also means¬†_==revelation_, the unveiling of a new truth, one that forever changes the old order of things.== (If anyone says the phrase \"new normal\" to me, I will scream, but you get the idea.) \n\t- And one of the most radical things we can do in a time of crisis is hold onto the hope that there is something new at the end of all this, that hope persists even when we do not see or know it. As Louise Banks reminds us, ==even when we see ruin before us, we can embrace life and try to do what we can until the next thing is revealed.==\n- [N.K. Jemisin's 2018 Hugo Awards acceptance speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lFybhRxoVM)\n\t- Jemisin reminds us that even in times of hardship, science fiction and fantasy can give us hope: not just the feel-good belief that things can be better, but ==the rigorous work of imagining a different world, and the hard-edged joy of asserting that it can be real.== \n\t- \"It's been a hard year,\" Jemisin says, and that was true in 2018 and it's certainly true now. We hope that your exploration of science fiction, and the work you will put into living this year and beyond, can take something from what she has to share.\n\t- The stars are closer, true believers, and the apocalypse is upon us. Let's ride.\n\n#### Creature Spotlight: Here There Be Dragons\nThis is a part of the course that I'm calling¬†**Creature Spotlights.**¬†We know our time is limited this quarter, and we didn't want to overwhelm you with too many texts, but we also wanted the opportunity to discuss some very cool creatures from science fiction that didn't quite make the cut as full readings. Creature Spotlights are our way of remedying that--a series of quick discussions (**strictly optional--**if you're low on time, feel free to ignore Creature Spotlights entirely) about iconic or popular science fiction creatures that we can discuss without taking too much time away from the course reading list. And we're starting here because while this is specifically a science fiction course rather than a broader class on speculative fiction, we would be remiss if we didn't talk about one of the most iconic creatures in popular culture and mythology: the dragon.\n\n- The dragon's symbolic power as an exercise in applying semiotics to a fictional creature \n\t- See, the interesting thing about dragons is that while we all more or less know what a dragon is, the image of the dragon has never been entirely constant, instead shifting as one examines different eras and cultures throughout history.\n\t- ¬†[**\"The Evolution of Dragons in Western Literature: A History\"**](https://www.tor.com/2019/10/23/the-evolution-of-dragons-in-western-literature-a-history/)\n\t\t- Early in her article, she lays the foundation for her exploration of the various forms of the dragon with these paragraphs: ![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20230127135509.png]]\n\t\t- Shiau's article is a great survey of the various dragon archetypes that have proliferated throughout Western culture and history: she does a good job exploring what the dragon in all its many forms has meant to us. Where she leaves room to speculate is the¬†_why_¬†of it: why¬†_this_¬†is the image (or set of images) that has stuck with us and become so iconic and powerful in all our minds.\n\t- If you're interested in learning more about dragons, or want to watch a really cool text that treats a fictional creature as if it were real (what am I talking about, of course dragons are real), you can check out¬†[**The Last Dragon**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18X0otcm0gtq1Fu2vKD5e9IZ6VSt_hab3/view?usp=share_link), one of our suggested readings for the course. It's a 2004 docufiction film directed by Justin Hardy that examines how dragons might have evolved throughout history if they'd been real. It's totally optional, but it might be a cool source of inspiration for ways to approach the creative project for this class (and it's very much in the spirit of what this class is all about).\n- But for now, it's¬†**discussion**¬†**prompt time.**\n\t- Choose¬†**one of the \"major dragons\"**¬†which Shiau identifies (or some other pop culture dragon that you'd like to talk about).

[but] more usually it will be predicated on a number of interrelated _nova_.\"\n- Suvin posits \"a spectrum... running from the idal extreme of exact **recreation** of the author's empirical environment to **exclusive interest** in [the _novum_].\"\n\t- E.G. magical realism v.s. X-Men?\n\n#### Science Fiction as Creative Cognition\n- \"SF is then a literary genre whose necessayr and sufficient conditions are the **presence and interaction of estrangement and cognition**, and whose main formal device is **an imaginative framework alternative to the author's empirical environment.**\"\n\t- E.G. biology cells -\u003e zombies\n- \"For somebody **to see all normal happens in a dubious light**, he would ned to develop [a detached eye]...

Black Mirror's *Nosedive*\n- \"This genre has always been wedded to **a hope of finding[,] in the unknown[,] the ideal** environment, tribe, state, intelligence or other aspect of the Supreme Good (or to a **fear and revulsion from its contrary**).\"\n- \"I look to science fiction and fantasy as the ==aspirational drive of the Zeitgeist==: we creators are the engineers of posibility.

Why was that so hard?\"_\n- With these words, Sinclair identifies the ==tensions of the modernist==, which have to do with the clash of the self with forces that impact on it.\n- And what are these forces? Why, you name them!  ^c0f6dd\n\t- We have social expectations, nature, what people say about us, what people say we should do, events like political issues, national elections, and war.\n- And, on top of all that, the self clashes with the self too! The ==unconscious==, the ==psyche==, is there. \n- So, the modern condition is characterized by the struggle of ==Being or 'be-ing'== as a process against all these external and internal forces. \n\t- In other words, whereas the philosdpher, Rene Descarte, famously uttered the words,¬†_I think therefore I am_, the modern condition might as well say,¬†_I am? What is that?_¬†All these forces that we struggle against have made it very difficult to figure out who we are and¬†_live the life that is inside us_. ^69c3cc\n\t- As you go through this module--no, through the whole class--bear in mind this struggle of¬†_be-ing_. How do I live the life that is inside of me, trying to get out? OR, what's my thing? And how will I know what it is?\n\n\u003e Can you identify some forces that impact make it hard for a person to discover a sense of self? Write no more than 150 words.\n\nFor me, some forces that have been definitely getting in the way of *being* are societal expectations and self-imposed pressure ‚Äî both of which go hand in hand. Nowadays, in a hyper-online world, we're exposed to the highlights of everyone' lives; unfortunately, this exacerbates my unhealthy tendency to compare myself to others. It leads me to working myself to the bone in order to \"catch up\", which isn't helpful at all. It gives me no time to discern whether or not a certain goal is good for me at all.\n\n#### More about modernism\n- _Modernism_¬†is not about a certain time period. Rather, it's about ==a way of perceiving, a way of be-ing, a sensibility, a way of thinking about the self==, compared to other ways of perceiving and be-ing.\n- Here are two poems that express different ways of perceiving the self, different ways of be-ing. On one hand, we have Romanticist John Keats and on the other hand, we have the Bard, William Shakespeare. Shakespeare lived two centuries before Keats; yet, his poem expresses a modernist sensibility.\n\n##### Keats' poem to the stars\n![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20230201114035.png]]\n- In this poem, the persona (and the voice of the poem can be the poet or can be someone else) speaks of admiring the ==steadfastness== of a star... the forever that stars seem to symbolize. \n- The quality of steadfastness, which the persona admires, is ==found in nature, outside the self.== The self, then, can, like nature, have this quality. \n- As we read the poem, we also get the feeling that ==natural processes are to be admired and human beings, to reach the fullness of ourselves, should aspire to have the perfection of nature.== Reading Keats and you almost have the feeling that the human and nature should be one.\n\n##### Shakespeare's Macebeth: Deathbed speech\n![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20230201114149.png]]\n- After everything he had achieved, Macbeth knows that he is about to die. If you've read the play, Macbeth did everything he could to secure power for himself and for his descendants but ==death is inevitable== and in these lines, he realizes that he has been defeated. \n- In these lines, Shakespeare uses a favorite comparison, that is, the ==similarity between an individual human life and a character (a player) in a stage play==, who enters and exits the stage on cue.\n\n##### Comparison\n- The contrast between Keats's poem and Shakespeare's illustrates some very important characteristics of the modernist sensibility. \n- For one thing, Keats, because of is allusions to nature, give us the feeling of the ==immortality of the self.== Even in death, we are like nature so we continue somehow, along with stars, grass, rocks, fields, the sea. \n- But with Shakespeare, Macbeth realizes that upon his death, he is, well, dead. His life is snuffed out like a candle, like an actor who has to leave the stage. With the modernist sensibility, ==life is rendered woefully inadequate== and it's only, in Macbeth's words, 'an idiot' who will refuse to accept that.¬†\n- But, what we learn from modernism, though, is ==despite knowing that life is finite, the process of¬†_truly_¬†be-ing itself seems to be what life is all about.==\n\n#### The power of the psyche\n- Two important figures to modernism are the great psychoanalysts, Sigmund Freud and Carl Gustav Jung. \n- When Freud wrote about the unconscious and Jung, his student, continued his work, it became ==impossible to think of the human being as 'whole'.== \n- If you notice, in Keats's poem, the notion of steadfastness is accepted as a trait that people can aspire for. The conflict comes out of the ==persona wanting that trait but maybe not quite having it yet.==\n- With Shakespeare, though, the conflict is in the very nature of selfhood. If tomorrow will come and we all die, then what for is ==carving a self==? \n- With Keats, what is at stake are ==the qualities that the self can have.== With Shakespeare, what is at stake is ==the existence of the self.== In other words, with Shakespeare, ==the self is fractured, having a nature that is at war with itself.==\n- Jung has pointed out that ==we are 'enigmas' to ourselves.== Because we don't know ourselves, we are in a state of conflict with ourselves. ^eb7f5b\n- Jung has also pointed out that ==self-knowledge is usually just based on what we know of ourselves socially.==  ^0ca92b\n\t- Take myself as an example. Socially, I am female, married, middle-aged, teacher, Filipino, middle-class, educated, administrator, martial artist, crocheter, cat mom, cyclist, homemaker. All these social identifiers of who I am affect my decisions and my sense of self. \n\t- But as Jung would say, these are all just on the surface. ==It's what is happening in the psyche that matters.== Hence, I sometimes have strange and vivid dreams that have nothing to do with who I am socially. And this is why ==to the modernist sensibility, we all have cracks and fissures where 'true being',== as Jung would say, come out.¬†\n- Jung has also argued that ==the problem with society is it only cares for what is external.== The psyche itself is ignored and this leads to many problems, such as mental health and behavioral issues. He has argued that ignoring the psyche will lead us all to very detrimental effects. \n- To Jung, we have long forgotten to pay careful attention to the individual; ==sacrificing the individual for the collective.== Hence, modern society ignores the authentic responses of the individual, in favor of collective conditions.  ^45816b\n\t- This is why history is full of movements of collective acts (like war) but the individual may feel alienated from these collective acts. There is no such thing as a whole individual, just as there is no such thing as a whole society or culture.\n- To read: **Jung's \"[[Sources/The Undiscovered Self]]\".**\n\n#### What is reality anyway?\n\n^69ac07\n\n- What we also learn from the work of psychoanalysts is that reality does not necessarily exist as an objective truth. Rather, ==the world to us is defined for us by how we see it.== And how we see the world and how we are in the world are also largely ==determined by the unconscious==, by the psyche that we know so little about.¬†\n- The fact that it's difficult to put a finger on objective reality comes out in our ==languaging.== Many of the things we say, can, after all, be questioned grammatically. For example:¬†_the sky is blue,¬†isn't it_?¬†¬†_I am a girl,¬†aren't I_?¬†It can be very difficult for us to understand each other because ==we perceive reality in different ways.==\n\n#### Reading \"Demian\"\nAs you read it, ask yourself how the lives of Demian and Emile Sinclair seem to give expression to Jung's ideas, particularly:\n-  how reality is created by our own perceptions as opposed to the perceptions of others\n-   why the journey to the self can be terrifying\n-   how collective action can actually both enrich and obliterate the self\n\nQuestion: Do you think Demian and Sinclair had found true self-knowledge? Have you?\n\n## Psychology of Personal Growth\n#psychology #personaldevelopment \n### The Power of Habit\n1. **Habits are simple cue-routine-reward loops that save effort.**\n\t1. MIT experiment: mice seeking chocolate in maze\n\t\t1. When they memorized the path, brain activity lessened\n\t2. Chunking: process of turning a sequence of actions into an automatic routine\n\t3. Habit loop\n\t\t1. Cue\n\t\t2. Routine\n\t\t3. Reward\n\t4. ==Habits are incredibly resilient.== Learning and maintaining habits lies in the *basal ganglia*, a small neurological structure embedded deep in the brain. Even if the rest of the brain is damaged, this can still function normally.\n\t\t1. Same can apply to bad habits; you may always be at the risk of relapsing\n2. **Habits stick because they create craving.**\n\t1. Kicking a bad habit is hard because you develop a *craving* for the reward at the end of the habit loop.\n\t2. *Anticipation* is the neurological basis of craving, which explains why habits are so powerful.\n\t3. Craving works for good habits as well, E.G. exercise.\n\t4. ==Craving is what solidifies the habit==; cues and rewards alone are not enough.\n\t5. Companies try to create craving for their consumers too.\n\t\t1. Example application: Claude Hopkins, the man who popularized Pespodent toothpaste by creating the cool, minty feeling you get after brushing your teeth. \n3. **To create a habit, substitute a routine for another and believe in the change.**\n\t1. Golden rule for quitting any habit: *don't try to resist the craving, redirect it.*\n\t\t1. Keep the same cues and rewards, but change the routine that occurs as a result of the craving.\n\t2. While habit-replacement is effective, it can be rendered null ==whenever stress occurs.== Old habits die hard, no matter how much time you take trying to kill them.\n\t3. Those who resist relapse and remain sober often rely on belief.\n\t\t1. Importance of spirituality and God in AA philosophy\n\t\t2. It's not necessarily the religious component itself that helps people stay sober. ==Believing in God also helps the participants believe in the possibility of change for themselves, which makes them stronger in the face of stressful life events.==\n4. **Change can be achieved by focusing on keystone habits and achieving small wins.**\n\t1. Paul O'Neill as CEO of Alcoa\n\t\t1. Workplace safety\n\t\t2. Habits exists in organizations, and changing an organization's direction is a matter of changing its habits.\n\t2. Not all habits are created equal. \n\t3. **Keystone habits:** more important than other habits, because adhering to these create positive effects that spillover to other areas.\n\t\t1. Example keystone habit for individuals: keeping a meticulous food journal\n\t\t2. These habits work by providing ==small wins== -- that is, early successes are fairly easy to attain. \n\t\t3. Developing a keystone habit helps you believe that improvement is possible in other spheres of life, too, which can trigger a cascade of positive change.\n5. **Willpower is the most important keystone habit.**\n\t1. Marshmallow experiment\n\t\t1. The ones who delayed gratification often ended up becoming more successful in life\n\t2. Willpower is actually like a muscle: it can tire.\n\t\t1. If you exhaust it by concentrating on a demanding task, you'll have no willpower left after doing it.\n\t\t2. You can strengthen your willpower by engaging in habits that demand resolution (e.g. adhering to a strict diet). Like a willpower workout\n\t3. Other factors can impact willpower as well, such as people you interact with\n\t\t1. Starbucks LATTE method\n\t4. A lack of autonomy also adversely affects willpower.\n\t\t1. If people do something because they are ordered to rathen than by choice, their willpower muscle tires much quicker.\n6. **Organizational habits can be dangerous, but a crisis can change them.**\n\t1. E.G. King's Cross 1987 fire\n\t2. Crises offer a unique chance to reform organizational habits by providing a sense of emergency.\n\t3. Good leaders often actively prolong a sense of emergency or even exacerbate it.\n\t\t1. This is because it allows for various solutions to arise.\n7. **Companies take advantage of habits in their marketing.**\n\t1. DYK: filling up your cart with healthy items first makes you more likely to buy unhealthy items later\n\t2. When trying to sell anything new, companies will try their best to make it familiar.\n8. **Movements are born from strong ties, peer pressure, and new habits.**\n\t1. E.G. Rosa Parks and the civil rights movement\n\t2. She had Strong ties: concept from sociology; first-hand relationships with people across different sectors of community\n\t3. Weak ties: acquaintances rather than friends\n\t4. Weak ties, combined with strong ties, empower peer pressure.\n9. **We bear the responsibility for changing our habits.**\n\t1. Once we become aware of a harmful habit, it becomes our responsibility to address and change it.\n\n### Good Writing\n#writing\n1. Rubrics\n\t1. Grammar\n\t2. Style and Reference\n\t3.

I can connect this to my tendency to overeat, especially during times of stress; sweet foods like chocolates are often the main culprits. One simple change I can do to address this is drink water first whenever I feel hungry. Another simple change I can do is to replace my usual sweets with healthier alternatives (e.g. switching out ice cream for greek yoghurt).","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.731605397Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2023-02-02":{"title":"2023-02-02","content":"## Discerning Life Questions\n#DLQ10 #religion #spirituality #philosophy \n\n- [[Sources/The Flying Spaghetti Monster, Aristotle, and Fernando Amorsolo]]\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.731605397Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2023-02-03":{"title":"2022-02-03","content":"## Historical and Philosophical Foundations of Education\n#EDUC101i #education #history #philosophy \n### Education in Ancient Greece\n#### Greece: Land of Heroes and Thinkers\n- The mountainous terrains of Greece promoted the development of independent polis or city-states.¬† Two of these city-states are Sparta and Athens.¬† Knowing about the ideologies and way of life of the Spartans and Athenians can provide context about the educational system that developed in each city-state.\n- **[Sparta and Athens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzxUnMr3API)**\n\t- Spartan society was completely dominated by war\n\t\t- Started training boys after birth\n\t\t- Refused to use bow and arrows\n\t\t- Boys would live in barracks for 20-30 years\n\t\t- Didn't have walls because they wanted to be invaded?\n\t\t- Even women trained\n\t- Athenians were more inclined to study science, philosophy, and art\n\t\t- Only had to serve in the army for 2 years\n\t\t- Learned how to read\n\t\t- Wealthy families could hire private tutors\n\t- Peloponnesian War\n![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20230203131347.png]]\n#### Reading into Ancient Greek Education\n- **[First 3 Eras of Greek Education](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2qjusN-qKE)**\n\t- **Homeric**\n\t\t- Aim: **To be \"God-like\"** a.k.a. to form someone to be a...\n\t\t\t- Man of Wisdom (Oddyseus)\n\t\t\t- Man of Action (Achilles)\n\t\t- Class system was very much in place; with **different classes came different trainings**\n\t\t\t- E.G. slaves taught you how to do the labor they had to do\n\t\t- Mostly **informal** -- through families and work\n\t\t\t- Oral tradition\n\t- **Spartan**\n\t\t- Aims:\n\t\t\t- **Military Excellence** (prepare for war)\n\t\t\t- Perfection of the **body** for the **state**\n\t\t- Military training (from age 7)\n\t\t- Corporal punishment\n\t- Early Athenian\n\t\t- Aims:\n\t\t\t- **Beauty, grace of body and spirit**\n\t\t\t- **Civic virtue and participation in \"state life\"** (religious, social, political, military)\n\t\t- Organization/Type:\n\t\t\t- \"School\" - formal education\n\t\t\t- Pedagogues - slaves who were in charge of guiding young Athenians in early education\n\t\t- **\"Public life\" as school**\n\t\t\t- in the latter part of one's education\n\t\t\t- as they engaged in public life, that's when they continued to learn\n\t- Later Athenian\n\t\t- Sophists\n\t\t- Plato\n\t\t- Socrates\n\t\t- Aristotle\n- **Greek Education PDF**\n\n#### Reflecting on Greek Education\n\u003e To synthesize what you've learned about Greek Education,\n\u003e**1.)

In**¬†**approx. 3-5 sentences, share about how the issue was dealt with in Greek education**¬†(Identifying the specific segment in Greek Education),¬†**as well as what you think might have affected this.**¬†Cite excerpts from the readings to qualify your statements (cited phrases not included in the 3-5 sentences).\n\nOne problem present in Greek Education (particularly the Late Athenian period) that still challenges us today is the emphasis of bookish and schoolroom tactics \"...in which rote learning or memorization was superseding the activities of the earlier period.\" An example of this in our present times is the study of history; I can't help but think about how most of my history classes relied on memorization methods. Solutions to this problem were offered by one of the most prominent philosophers at the time: Socrates. One is informal education; \"He believed in gaining knowledge through direct contct with people and by personal observation and experience. He felt that in such ways knowledge revealed itself through the soul.\"; the other is the Socratic method, which aimed to make students' aware of (and thus act on) their own ignorance. However, despite these methods being influential today, they weren't able to shape educational practices in Ancient Greece due to the selfish individualism of the populace; \"The people as a whole, though superficially acquainteed with their teachings, were little influenced by them; while most of the nelightened and educated class were already throughly corrupted... The lack of ethical standards developed by this individualistic education ultimately brought the Athenians to ruin.\"\n\n\n- problems\n\t- education's emphasis on memory (e.g. drills, lectures)\n\t\t- \"Education tended to emphasize bookish and schoolroom tactics, in which rote learning or memorization was superseding the activities of the earlier period.\"\n\t- I believe this can still be present in our schools today...I can't help but think about how much of my historical education consisted of memorization\n- solution\n\t- the intellectual training that developed during the late Athenian period e.g. Socratic method....ensures that the student is critically thinking\n\t- revival of activity method\n\n### Summary of Module 1\n- **CONTEXT SHAPES PURPOSE**\n\t- One of the initial patterns that we have began to explore in module 1 was how the context of an era shaped the purpose of education - ex. how China's geography led it its aim of \"self-preservation\" - or how the beliefs of the various eras in ancient greek society led to different perspectives about the aim of education. \n\t- As you reflect on your own teaching philosophy, think about today's context? ==How does your own personal vision of what education is for grounded in the needs of today's context?==\n- **PURPOSE SHAPES PRACTICE**\n\t- Another pattern we began to see was how the aim of education affected the types and methods of education. If you look at institutions today, I think we can continue to say the same thing - for example, schools like Ateneo who continues to put to forefront being a person for others encourage reflection about society and one's role in our courses.","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.731605397Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2023-02-07":{"title":"2023-02-07","content":"## Biology of Science Fiction\n#BIO21i #biology #sciencefiction\n### Module 2: Biodiversity in Science Fiction\n#### Evolution Explains Biodiversity Anywhere\n- One of the most fascinating things about science fiction that showcases biological tropes is ==the diversity of non-Earth species==, many of which are intelligent humanoids that are able to communicate with humans.\n- But not all life in sci-fi worlds is willing or have the capacity to communicate and cooperate. Out there are aliens so bizarre in morphology and psychology that normal means of communication are difficult at best and deadly at worst.\n\nThere are two primary questions to answer in exploring the biodiversity of sci-fi worlds:\n1. Where did all this biodiversity come from?\n2. What role does evolution play in this biodiversity?\n\nTo be able to understand these, we turn to the only real-life example that we know for now: Earth. Watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJZNOw3IA4) for a discussion on how evolution explains biodiversity.\n\n- **[[Cards/Speciation]]** is an evolutionary process that gives rise to new species from pre-existing ones.\n  - What this implies in science fiction is that all of the sci-fi aliens that we know had ancestors, unless the species itself is the progenitor of all life.\n  - But speciation is a long process (on Earth, it normally takes at least a million years) and requires **reproductive isolation** or the inability of two formerly intermingling and reproducing populations to keep on mating. \n  - Usually, that's due to a geographical barrier that physically separates them, which is the mode of speciation called **allopatric** (allo = different, patric = land). In many of these shared universes, allopatric speciation may explain why so many humanoid species look alike; they probably shared ancestors and just evolved separately because they were separated by space!   \n- Also important in understanding speciation is the concept of the **[[Cards/Niche]]**, which ecologically speaking is ==the set of all possible environmental conditions that will allow a population to sustain itself.==\n  - According to the **[[Cards/Competitive Exclusion Principle]]**, ==no two species can occupy the same niche at the same time indefinitely.== Two species can compete for the same resource for only so long; the outcompeted will have to diverge from the niche and thus potentially become a new species, or else go extinct. \n  - A lot of sci-fi worlds with vicious apex predators, especially intelligent ones, probably won their dominance in this way. And then there are those that expand their genetic reach in even more fearsome ways: through forceful parasitism and assimilation.\n\n**Points for Discussion**\n1. Can the niche of a sci-fi species be considered a novum of its own? If yes, how so?\n2. Look for examples of alien species in a shared sci-fi universe that are (or may be) results of allopatric speciation.\n\n#### The Life Out There: Attempts at Classification\n- In biology, we try to make sense of species and their evolutionary relationships through **classification**, which is ==placing them in distinct groups called taxa (singular: taxon)== like specific kingdoms (e.g. Plantae, Animalia), phyla (e.g. Chordata, Arthropoda, Cnidaria), classes (e.g. Mammalia, Amphibia, Insecta), etc. that share very similar characteristics.\n  - This, along with naming species, is a practice in the science of **taxonomy**. \n- Like what Sir. Ron says in his article \"Mutations and Metamorphoses: Body Horror is Biological Horror\" (Journal of Popular Film and Television 40:160-168, 2102) about hybrids in body horror cinema, ==the other-ness of aliens may perhaps be treated as a _taxonomic_ cognitive estrangement, because they defy Earth-based categorizations even if they seem similar to our life-forms.==\n- When trying to make sense of sci-fi aliens, it is ==safe to assume that life on these other planets have the same genetic code and follow the same genetic mechanisms and evolutionary tendencies as life on Earth==, unless the text tells us otherwise.\n  - So we can expect very similar forms to Earth's organisms, with liberal modifications, to populate fictional worlds. \n  - On Earth, the most common animals are arthropods (those like insects, spiders, and crustaceans that have jointed appendages and a hard chitinous exoskeleton), molluscs (soft-bodied often shelled animals like snails, bivalves, and squids), and chordates (the large group that includes vertebrates like ourselves). Can we expect to see the same trends in science fiction?\n\n##### Exercise\nAs a an exercise in exploring the biodiversity in sci-fi, go to the [Alien Species Wiki](https://aliens.fandom.com/wiki/Alien_Species_Wiki) and select one (1) alien species (try one that isn't too popular or obvious!) and use the following dichotomous key to try to classify it according to Earth definitions (which as of now are the only ones we have to go by!). We've said that the cognitive estrangement in these alien life-forms may lie in their blurring of our taxonomic categories, but that doesn't mean that we can't try to make sense of them!\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23095578/217153022-f01aaf3e-d173-4f2a-963d-bb28203746a9.png)\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23095578/217153095-f5154d6b-b449-4eb6-9096-43379f02ca40.png)\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23095578/217153118-20ac56f8-be88-4459-aeb3-ddb5d623dfc5.png)\n\n#### Phenotypes and Archetypes\n- One important part of reading science fiction creatures is looking at ==how their design affects their semiotic content==--the ways in which how they look and function as organisms contribute to the meaning/s they communicate as part of text.\n- While the creatures and worlds of science fiction are imaginary, this is not to say they come _purely_ from the imagination. All science fiction is produced by at least one author rooted in what we know as the real world (what Suvin calls **\"the set normative system\"**), and so ==every work of science fiction is necessarily informed by and responding to the real world==, at least as perceived by the author.\n\t  - This is ideally true on a scientific level--if we believe good science fiction is at least somewhat informed by the principles of good science--but it is also true on a literary level. \n\t  - What this means is that we, as both readers and authors of science fiction, come into it with ==our own set of biases that shape our reading==, and these are perspectives we can both employ and interrogate when it comes to examining the fantastic _nova_ that inhabit our stories. \n\n##### Hyperlanes\n  - In the Kickstarter-backed _Hyperlanes_, a sci-fi campaign setting that uses D\u0026D 5th edition rules, race (here called species) selection in the process of character generation provides more flexibility, allowing a player to create new species using template traits for common biological forms. Read Chapter 1: Species of the player's guide.\n  - For this discussion and the special quiz, you need to read the section on Physiology (starting on page 6), but we highly encourage you to read the entire chapter.\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23095578/217154024-52f14d64-125b-4a96-aba2-bf65a204dc92.png)\n\nHere are the Physiologies that the book offers as options, with Ron's notes on the biological bases for their suggested traits:\n- **Amphibian:** I wouldn't say that amphibians are naturally more dexterous than us or our fellow mammals, but their tongues are definitely quick at capturing prey! Take note that not all amphibians can leap like frogs do, because salamanders are also amphibians, and so are some limbless, snake-like animals called caecilians. Quite a number of amphibians do have poisonous skin, so that's a good call, but usually you'd have to ingest the animal or get its toxins in your blood to be affected (and that's why they're poisonous and not venomous). But the more accurate traits here are Prefers the Damp and Water Adapted. Being direct descendants of fish and spending their larval stages in the water, amphibians are largely semi-aquatic, and they cannot survive in dry environments because they need to breathe through their skin.\n- **Arthropoid:** In kingdom Animalia, the term \"arthropoid\" would actually refer to organisms that belong to phylum Arthropoda, which is distinct from other groups of animals due to their exoskeleton made of chitin or calcium carbonate, which they typically shed, and their jointed appendages (including legs and wings). So the Body Armor and Extra Limbs traits have those covered. It's good that they didn't include flight as a trait because insect wings are too flimsy to allow a human-sized individual to truly fly.\n- **Arachnoid:** Biologically speaking, arachnids are actually also arthropods, but I suppose having the ability to produce your own webbing gives you the right to your own template. The Spinnerets trait covers that and is amusingly accurate because that's really what a spider's silk-spinning appendages are called. Take note, however, that scientifically, the term arachnid refers not only to spiders but also to scorpions, ticks, mites, and harvestmen (daddy longlegs).\n- **Aquatic:** It's a catch-all template that could easily mean you're fish-like as much as it can mean that you're a giant jellyfish. The Water Mastery trait is obvious, but the 360 Vision and Pilot's Mind traits are inspired additions because being surrounded by water and receiving stimuli from all around you at the same time does give you a different sort of perspective (I could imagine). This is especially true of radially symmetrical organisms like jellyfish that have sensory cells arranged all around their bell (that round part that looks like a head but isn't), but in a certain amusing way, the same can also be said of fish because of their lateral line system and the freaky fact that they have taste buds on their skin.\n- **Avian:** The writers aren't fans of the aarakocra, are they? Instead of giving this template true flight, they limit the wings' capabilities to gliding. I wouldn't use size as an excuse, as there have historically been pretty big natural fliers in Earth's history, but it would make sense for avian characters to have lighter, hollow bones, so I would probably consider decreasing Constitution a bit. Birds, especially the predatory ones, do usually have keener eyesight and larger optic lobes than most other animals, so Superior Vision and Pilot's Mind are a nice touch.\n- **Cephalapoid:** Did anyone say Cthulhu? The amazing group of animals called cephalopods, which is a type of mollusk, deserves so much more than the typical aquatic traits and the Extra Limbs feature. I'd personally throw in a Constitution increase given their toughness, something that enhances their Perception because of their sensory acuity, and some special camouflaging ability due to their ability to control their pigmentation. Now THAT would make an awesome character race.\n- **Fungoid:** Dispersed Physiology? Iron Constitution? Mycotoxins? Saprophyte? These authors had a ball with designing this template, the most unique of all of them (maybe they were on shrooms). Each of these traits is spot-on in portraying the novelty of the lowly fungus and makes for a character design unlike any other. if I were to nitpick, I'd swap the touch-dependent Mycotoxins ability with one that allows the character to disperse poisonous spores, but that's probably asking for too much. And also, fungi don't have brains. Or a head. But we're talking about humanoid fungi anyway.\n- **Gastropoid:** Another mollusk, gastropods are a group of animals known mostly for the shells that they have on their backs, but do note that there are shell-less snails (generally called slugs). The Slime Trail is a nice (if a bit gross) touch, though I'd have added some form of communication with fellow gastropoids in that ability. Also, the Armored Body trait is cool and all, but let's all remember that you'd have to be lugging that large, cumbersome thing around with you. One question: can they hide inside their shells?\n- **Mammalian:** Given how highly social an animal a typical mammal is, the Group Behavior feature makes sense. The four subtemplates give some variation to what would have been an otherwise uninteresting template (there's only so much benefit you can gain from fur and mammary glands) and touch on peculiarities of some major mammalian lifestyles.\n- **Plantoid:** Obviously, Photosynthesis is the best and most scientifically accurate feature of this template. I would have taken that trait further to waive the character's need to eat food as long as it gets regular sunlight exposure. And what about thorns?\n- **Reptilian:** The Natural Weaponry, Scaly Armor, and Darkvision traits are expected. Venom would have been a nice touch, but of course not all reptiles have venomous bites.\n\n(Sir AJ's Note : The way games address race--or, if you prefer, species or ancestry or physiology--is a highly animated area of discussion in gaming circles, particularly in systems like Hyperlanes and D\u0026D where there are multiple sapient species. If we distinguish these species mechanically, how much of that is rightful respect for biological diversity, and ==how much of that is reproducing the colonial mindset that some races are inherently better than others at certain things?== Consider how humans are always portrayed as a jack-of-all-trades species in fiction, whereas nonhuman species tend to be pigeonholed into particular cultures or stereotypes--goblins are almost always savage enemies, elves are almost always ethereal and graceful and wise, and so on--and then think about how that lines up with real-world stereotypes about different human ethnicities.)\n\n##### Arrival's Heptapods\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23095578/217154518-74241d2f-f8cd-4263-a46c-0fabc44636c6.png)\n- Broadly speaking, the heptapod's design is reminiscent of three things: a squid or octopus, a seven-fingered hand, and at the top, the barest suggestion of a human head and torso. \n  - Cephalopods like squid and octopi are among the most alien-looking creatures we have on Earth, largely because their bodies are so dissimilar to ours: they have tentacles instead of jointed limbs, the tentacles are all in one place, and it's more difficult to ascribe orientation (e.g. forward, backward, up, down) than it is for ours. \n  - The heptapods take these traits and echo them, even moving in a squidlike manner and communicating through disgorging squid-like ink. Much about the design of the heptapods is meant to ==intentionally invoke our conceptions of squid and octopi==, which then draws on all our associations of them as ==strange, alien creatures. ==\n- ==This design philosophy is echoed in the heptapod script:== just as the heptapods have \"no forward or backward movement,\" so too does their language not read in a linear way, and this is further echoed by their perception of time. \n  - The [[Cards/Sapir-Whorf hypothesis]] quoted in the film--the real-world theory that ==the structure of our language affects the way we see the world==--is born out in the way the creatures' language, perceptions, and appearance all reflect and reinforce each other: radial, nonlinear, otherworldly.\n- But the heptapods are more than just calligrapher squid--==they also incorporate some human elements, but in a highly _defamiliarized_ manner. ==\n\t- The top of the heptapod looks like a human head and torso, but stripped of all identifying features. \n\t- The form of the squid, which already sort of resembles a tentacled hand, has the hand-like aspect of its design heightened: the limbs of the heptapod look more like spider legs or human fingers, and each of them ends in its own set of starfish-like fingers or tendrils. \n\t- The hand is traditionally seen as an image of familiarity and affinity: humanlike hands are things we can shake, things that hold things the way we do, things we associate with caresses and intimacy and humanity. \n\t  - But the heptapods subvert that expectation by estranging the image of the hand: the hand becomes the entire body (which then has its own, smaller hands, which totally isn't creepy at all), the number of fingers becomes seven (a number we are not used to seeing in anatomy), and the fingers at once resemble tentacles and spider limbs. \n\t  - This design exemplifies ==the blend of cognition, the understanding of the familiar, and estrangement, the divergence from expectations of normality==, that is at the heart of science fiction. The heptapods are bizarre and relatable, known and unknown to us.\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23095578/217154819-b1972edb-2b0e-478c-a5d6-f6e0616faa4e.png)\n\n- Often, we humans judge other creatures according to their proximity to the human norm: ==we find things that \"look more human\" more appealing, while othering and fearing things that are less so. ==\n  - This shapes, for example, our perceptions of the human-looking aliens of the Star Trek universe vis-a-vis the way we see the alien bugs from properties like Alien, StarCraft, Warhammer 40K, Ender's Game, and George R. R. Martin's \"Sandkings\" (which, spoiler, is one of our readings for this module!). \n  - On one level, this is natural, but on another level, it can be problematic if not outright dangerous: ==the very natural human affinity for things like us is also one of the ingredients that can fuel prejudice, racism, the violent subjugation of the other== that we see in both colonialism and fascism, you name it.\n- Indeed, ==the very human-centric-ness of science fiction==--again, natural, as most science fiction that humans read is also written by humans (citation needed)--==is often used to center the dominant point of view== (often cis, straight, white, and male), ==while othering aliens and relegating \"non-normative\" characteristics== (e.g. queer-coded traits and androgyny, or those associated with indigenous people or people of color) ==to the realm of the exotic and different==, the alien zoo or safari which our heroes explore and subject to their gaze.\n  - This is not to say that all evil bug aliens are actually the good guys, or that we should stop writing human protagonists and alien antagonists entirely and that all works that operate this way are Bad and Wrong. \n  - This is merely to say that ==we need to be conscious of our biases when we explore science fiction==--who it centers, who it marginalizes, who and what it portrays as complex and sympathetic versus flat and stereotypical, what characteristics from real-life cultures and communities it invokes and in what contexts--==in much the same way as we should be conscious of them in real life. ==\n  - A lot of good science fiction, especially these days, is likewise conscious of these biases, and may use and explore them as part of its project, and this is an exciting step in terms of seeing where the genre can go.\n\n#### \"Sandkings\" - Alien Ant Farm\n- \"Sandkings\" by George R. R. Martin is a story about pets and God. Or, to be more accurate (and less potentially heretical), pets and ==\"God,\" as in the general concept of a higher being (and the way we perceive and construct it, and the conditions under which we do so)== rather than any particular belief about one. \n- It's a story about ==gazing and being gazed upon==, and whether the one can truly happen without the other. \n- It's a story about a man named Simon Kress, an altogether terrible person who is utterly familiar to anyone who has ever fantasized about burning ants with a magnifying glass or playing The Sims just to watch virtual people suffer. And, as with so many works in our syllabus, it's ==a story about power, and what power does to those who wield it and those who do not.==\n- But mostly it's about bugs.\n\n##### Sandking Lane Build\n- The central _novum_ of the story is the titular sandkings, a creature best described as what happens when your ant farm decides to play DotA. Sandkings are social insect-like creatures with telepathic hive-minds centered on their maws, fertile queens that are described as looking like relatively large, slimy, featureless pieces of meat. \n- The maws spawn and control mobiles, the ant-like warriors that comprise the bulk of a sandking colony that eventually metamorphose into second-stage forms and possibly even rare third-stage forms designed by the maw itself. \n- Sandking colonies live in castle-like structures, and neighboring castles go to war with each other (or at least that is how they behave in captivity), and they seem to instinctively make art based on their keepers' appearance (again, in captivity, at least).\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23095578/217155643-9768880d-204d-43f5-b501-dfb4cb38972e.png)\n- The main quartet of sandking colonies around which the story revolves are divided by color, with black, red, white, and orange colonies all displaying different tendencies, battle skills, and aesthetic preferences, although we know these aren't the only colors that exist (Jala Wo has a yellow colony in her set). \n  - We don't know if the maws always come in sets of four, and we don't know if each color is necessarily associated with a certain set of traits. What we do know is that the sandkings behave very differently when abused, something the story highlights in a number of ways.\n- The sandkings are George R. R. Martin's take on a classic science fiction trope: that of the **alien bug**. \n  - From the tyranids of Warhammer 40K to the Brood who menace the X-Men to the Formics from Ender's Game, bug aliens are a common science fiction trope seen in a variety of texts across many media. \n  - Whether they are sapient, feral, or individually animalistic but controlled by impossibly intelligent hive-minds, they very often fall into the \"other\" category: whether deserved or not, whether subverted by the text or played straight, they are the alien to our human, the them to our us.\n- Some traits often shared by bug aliens are the following:\n  - Often not humanoid; even the more humanoid ones often have extra limbs (insect/non-human-like traits emphasized)\n  - Far too large (amps up their creepiness and unfamiliarity; giant bugs are scary)\n  - Collectivist societies, often ruled by hive-minds (this is an estrangement of the way real eusocial insect colonies behave)\n\n##### Sir. Ron's Notes\n- Let's dwell a bit on something that Sir. AJ just mentioned: **[[Cards/Eusociality]].** Among animals, eusociality is the ultimate expression of altruism: ==individuals in a colony are willing to sacrifice themselves for the benefit of the colony. ==\n  - Think bees, which die when they sting threats to their hive and their queen. As you may have guessed, such selfless living is quite rare in the natural world. Most known eusocial species, of which there are only few, are insects like bees and termites. There are a few in the marine environment like certain species of sponge-dwelling shrimp. \n  - Among mammals, there's only one type of animal known to be eusocial. No, it's not humans. It's the naked mole rat. \n- What do eusocial species have in common? It's important to take note that they live in tightly knit groups, specifically colonies, where a distinct division of labor is dictated upon by genetically predetermined roles. \n  - Because young that are born into the colony do not leave the home, there ends up being an overlapping of generations. Typically, there is only one reproductive female and so is the source of all progeny, making all her offspring virtually identical (especially in cases where there is also one only reproductive male). That's partly why self-sacrifice is ok, specifically from a genetic perspective; ==the loss of one individual isn't too much to bear if there are many other individuals that are genetically identical== (and since we're talking about organisms like insects, when we say \"many,\" we mean many). \n  - All non-reproductive individuals have roles in maintaining the colony, with the largest ones usually being relegated to defensive functions (and that's why most eusocial species are characterized by some weapon, like a bee's sting, an ant's mandibles, a shrimp's claws, and a naked mole rat's...naked ugliness? It's a confusing animal.).\n- It's fascinating how ==true altruism has been used by sci-fi as the basis for many of the most frightening characteristics of malevolent alien bug races, including the \"hive-mind\" social structure== (which, luckily enough for us feeble humans, is also often their greatest weakness, as exemplified by Starship Troopers and Ender's Game). \n  - Speaking of the hive-mind, the members of a eusocial colony are of course not joined telepathically and they don't \"think and act as one,\" but their collective actions are certainly guided and their social structures maintained by pheromones, which are hormones used within a species for a variety of purposes like finding mates, marking territory, tracking food sources, etc. \n  - And killing the queen will weaken the colony and cause a lot of disarray for a while, but it won't kill all the other individuals like some sort of kill switch. In fact, queens that die are usually quickly replaced by the next dominant female.\n- Having said all of that, the sandkings have many other peculiarities that don't have an analogue in the real biological world, which I think begs the question: _**Do they behave like this in the wild?**_ Or maybe an even better question is: _**Do they actually exist in the wild, or are they a scientific creation, such as through genetic engineering?**_ They're as mind-boggling as naked mole rats.\n\n##### The Pet-Owner's Gaze As Power Dynamic\n- It's impossible to really talk about the sandkings without also talking about Simon Kress, their owner and the ostensible protagonist (if not hero) of the story. \n- Kress' relationship to the sandkings is ostensibly ==panoptic, quite literally a relationship built around watching them:== he buys them as entertainment and keeps them in a clear tank that allows them to view them from above. \n- The sandkings' ability to look back up at him is limited by their small size, his great height and distance, and the rather more pressing matter of the other sandkings trying to kill them. \n- The sandkings can only escape Kress' perception by burrowing underground or remaining within their castles, while Kress can fully evade and manipulate the sandkings' perceptions of him through leaving the vicinity of the tank and changing the hologram of his face that he willingly and voluntarily provides them. \n- More, while Kress can always affect the sandkings--through giving or withholding food, manipulating their environment, stabbing them from above, and so on--the sandkings in turn cannot affect him in turn without leaving the tank.\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23095578/217156411-570363fc-a081-4aff-bf2c-6036d985c7b9.png)\n- The power relations at play between Kress and the sandkings have elements of the **[[Cards/Panopticon]]**, the ==system of surveillance and social control== theorized by Michel Foucault, as well as a **colonial** setup with ==Kress acting the part of surveilling colonizer to the sandkings' observed colonial subjects. ==\n  - The gaze signifies ==the power of the colonizer--the power to perceive==--and the story shows us how this is detrimental to the sandkings, as under Kress' abusive gaze they are no longer \"courtly ritual warriors\" but starving, desperate, and angry. \n  - The text likewise shows the ways in which the colonized can strike back: at first subversively, through the art that the sandkings make of Kress, and then more openly, through their conquest of his home. (#TeamSandkings, btw.)\n- ==Colonized and colonizer alike are scarred by the relationship of domination:== the sandkings are warped and traumatized, both while Kress is in control and even after they escape the tank. Kress, meanwhile, eventually begins to be subsumed into the telepathic hive-mind himself and is later forced to flee his home, but even before the sandkings escape, we see how the sandkings bring out his worst tendencies, encouraging him to make insane choices that center them, and his obsession with and control over them, in his life. \n\n##### Sandkings, Unite\n- Ultimately, \"Sandkings\" is a story about power-- ==the power we wield over those we perceive, the ways in which the powerful and the seemingly powerless interact, what power does to us all. ==\n- It's also just a really fun story about a terrible asshole of a man and the incredibly interesting bugs with which he becomes obsessed. \n- It's a great example of part of the course's spirit: ==our encounter with the alien, our recognition that the alien is at once more different from and more similar to us than we realized, and the ways in which we are changed by this recognition.==\n\n**Discussion Questions**\n1. Do you think the sandkings' status as bug aliens affects the reading of them as colonial subjects?\n2. Pick one of the sandking colonies. Discuss what your chosen colony represents in terms of oppression and how the oppressed respond to it.\n3. \"Sandkings\" focuses a lot on the sandkings' portraits of Simon Kress--Jala Wo explicitly describes them as \"worshipping\" their owners. Do you think the story is making a point about worship? If so, what is it? If not, what else might this theme be trying to interrogate?\n4. From a biological perspective, why are bugs so common in science fiction, especially as hostile invading alien races?\n\n#### Love, Death \u0026 Robots (\"The Swarm\") - Oops, All Bugs\n- The sixth episode of the third season of¬†_Love,_¬†_Death \u0026 Robots_¬†introduces us to the Swarm, an alien species that seems like the 2020's answer to the Zerg or the Tyranids. \n- The creatures of the Swarm are a teeming collective with all the characteristics of a classic bug alien hive: multiple specialized castes that work together, a central queen, and a mode of communication that is complex, sophisticated, and largely impenetrable to humans. \n\t- (Although the Swarm uses pheromones and chemical signals, funnily enough much closer to how actual eusocial insects communicate than the psychic hive mind trope that defamiliarizes real-world ant and bee communication.)\n![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20230208004402.png]]\n\n- The Swarm is also an example of another classic science fiction trope, one that often occurs in combination with the alien bug trope: the **assimilator**, ==a type of creature that integrates other species into itself. ==\n\t- When combined with the alien bug, the assimilator trope produces inhuman hordes of creatures that are often described as ravenous spacefaring locusts, devouring entire worlds and integrating their native sapient and non-sapient populations into themselves to create new breeds and castes. \n\t- Semiotically, this takes the alien-as-inhuman-Other image that is so associated with the bug alien and takes it a step further: the assimilating bug alien is an Other that is not only inhuman, but an inhuman Other that is potentially capable of taking what is human and transforming it into something inhuman. Other-ness as infection, as contagious, as disease. \n- If you want to read ==alien hives as a defamiliarization of collectivist societies as imagined by predominantly white writers from individualistic Global North cultures==, it's pretty telling that such writers often write these swarms to be actively bent on **expansion**, as if the biological ability to assimilate necessarily brings with it the desire to do so (or alternatively reinforces it, as if expansionism is a natural, assumed way of thinking, which is itself an interesting notion to unpack). \n\t- In that same vein, it might be worth exploring how this trope lines up with ==how the Global North has portrayed collectivist cultures, philosophies, and ideologies in general==, but that's a whole 'nother thing. (I imagine that for many writers, envisioning conquest as literal biological assimilation, outside of any statements about collectivism, whether implied or intentional, is just too tempting a metaphor to pass up!)\n![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20230208004717.png]]\n- But in \"Swarm,\" the titular creatures aren't conquerors or genetic expansionists--they're a largely insular, defensive species, one that seems to defend its own territories and assimilate invaders into itself but otherwise not possess a drive for conquest. \n\t- The queen isn't a psychic warlord; if we're to believe Dr. Mirny, the queen is primarily a producer of offspring, much closer to real-world insect queens. \n\t- The Swarm is framed as an impregnable biological fortress, an inscrutable machine that humanity wishes to penetrate with its gaze rather than an all-consuming tsunami that \"we\" must halt.\n- I say \"penetrate\" deliberately--==just as the gaze is a tool of domination, so too can \"understanding\" be one of violence, as careless categorization can flatten complex rationalities into oversimplified caricatures and pave the way towards exploitation==, as demonstrated by Dr. Afriel's plan for the Swarm's creatures. \n\t- When we impose labels without leaving space for nuance or complexity--when we use our knowledge to speak over and pigeonhole other intelligences without allowing them to speak for themselves or share their own knowledges with us--==we too are attempting a kind of assimilation==, a subsuming of other rationalities into our own systems of knowledge, misrecognizing the Other and seeing only their Other-ness and how we ourselves define it. \n\t- (Put plainly: relating to other people purely through our own preconceptions and preexisting biases, rather than allowing ourselves to meet them as they present themselves and speak of themselves, is a really shitty way to get to know anyone.)\n![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20230208004847.png]]\n- What the Swarm does with Dr. Mirny and Dr. Afriel--take direct control of the former via a \"brain\" caste specializing in intelligence, coerce the latter into breeding with Mirny (or Mirny's body) and raising humans loyal to the Swarm--is as terrifying as it is inhuman, and certainly plays into the horror-esque tropes associated with assimilator aliens. \n\t- But the brain creature claims to only be a few weeks old; if we believe it, it seems as though this behavior is simply the Swarm's way of retaliating against an invader who'd sought to control it first (the \"brain\" explicitly says its creation is the result of \"certain genetic protocols\" being triggered by Afriel's experiments). \n- If \"Sandkings\" showed us a nightmarish, hyperbolized version of ==colonized subjects speaking back to their abusive colonizer in the colonizer's own languages==, \"Swarm\" shows us another side of the coin: ==a \"people\" that refuses to be colonized==, that refuses colonizer definitions even up to and including their conception of being a political collective or a \"people\" at all, that uses a prospective conqueror's own methods against them while remaining fundamentally unknowable, such that as the colonizer seeks to pigeonhole the alien into human categories, the only \"human\" knowledge they find in the alien is their own face weaponized against them.\n\n**Discussion Points**\n1.  Dr. Afriel claims that because the Swarm creatures are nonsentient, breeding a Swarm queen and having her create a nest loyal to humanity would not harm anyone, as the human-controlled Swarm creatures wouldn't be \"staring up at the stars pining for their freedom.\" Ignoring the ramifications of such an endeavor on the intergalactic balance of power,¬†**assuming humanity actually could create and control a new Swarm queen and nest, do you think this would be as harmless or victimless an endeavor as Afriel claims?**\n2.  **\"Intelligence is not a winning survival trait.\"**¬†Discuss.\n3.  Discuss #2 in line with the brain creature's description of the Swarm's strategies when confronted with hostile aliens (\"[breeding] smarter, tougher versions of their [races] to fight them\") as well as its own stated specialty likewise being intelligence.¬†**Is the brain creature contradicting itself?**\n\n#### \"The Great Silence\" - Reimagine the Humble Parrot\nWe can attempt to talk about this in a number of ways (any number of which, if you wish, you can elaborate on in the discussion board):\n\n1.  What did you think of the work? Is this the kind of text you enjoy?\n2.  How does the text re/imagine parrots? How does it affect the way we view them?\n3.  What statement is the text offering about intelligence, sound, and the ways in which we see them?\n4.  If \"The Great Silence\" uses parrots as signifiers, what does it use them to signify? Do you think the signifier-signified model even applies to a work like this?\n5.  The story mentions the [[Cards/Fermi Paradox]]. What are some reasons why we haven't heard (as far as we know) from extraterrestrial life, even if they're likely out there?\n6.  The¬†_novum_¬†here is the premise: the narrator of the text is a parrot speaking to us, the audience. But you can also argue that this work might be considered nonfiction rather than science fiction,¬†_if_¬†you take the narrator parrot as a literary device rather than a literal presentation of a parrot who knows this much and is telling us about it. Do you have a view about what genre label or expectations to apply to this work? Do you think it matters?¬†\n","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.731605397Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2023-02-09":{"title":"2023-02-09","content":"## Biology of Science Fiction\n#BIO21i #biology #sciencefiction \n### Module 3: Origins, Life, and Species\n#### Origins, Endings, and Evolution\n![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20230209001919.png]]\n- Speculative evolution is the science and/or art of looking at the long, rich, complex history of how life came to be as it is on our planet and saying, ==\"Okay, but what if...?\" ==\n\t- We do this for a variety of reasons: because it's an interesting thought exercise, because we want to extrapolate from known patterns and take stock of how far life has come and imagine where it might yet go. Imagining the fantastic ways in which life on Earth could develop (or might have developed, in an alternate timeline) is something we do as scientists and as fictionists for any number of reasons, up to and including the fact that it's just plain fun.\n- But why do we find this exercise so compelling?\n\t- One reason is, of course, the fact that the creatures of speculative evolution are cool. As many of you will no doubt agree, the power of cool creatures can never be underestimated. And it's even cooler when we bring actual research and scientific grounding into the exercise, because it allows us to see that the same principles which keep our world familiar to us can also be extrapolated to create things that are both unlike anything we've ever seen and at the same time utterly plausible.\n\t- Where this all gets much more loaded is the concept of **speculative¬†_human_¬†evolution**: ==the exploration of the idea that there might be other kinds of people that we might become in the future or who may already be sharing the planet with us.== We ascribe a lot of value and weight to the term \"human,\" a word that has both social and biological connotations, and so the idea that there might be other types of creatures that might lay claim to the term on a social/identity level despite not being \"like us\" biologically is an idea to which humanity has always had varied and intense reactions, to say the least.\n![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20230209002243.png]]\n- As we know from science fiction in general, our questions about the future are really questions about the present: ==\"What will happen next?\" is really a question about what's happening now that we can't see==, and ==\"Who will we become?\" is really a question about who we already are.==\n\t- We see this tendency in our creation stories from religion and mythology: if you believe that humanity was shaped by hand in the image and likeness of God, for example, that's a metaphorical statement about our nature, value, and place in the universe. \n\t- Creationists thus might react violently to the idea that we are the product of random chance, because that can be read as an implicit denial of the idea behind the creationist credo: the belief that humanity is uniquely valued by a divine being who deliberately shaped us a certain way. \n\t- ==The story we believe about how we came to be is also, implicitly, the story we tell ourselves about why we are the way we are.== And you can project this logic forwards as well as backwards: a story about where you think we're going is really a statement about where you think we are now, and about our response to that. If you believe we will become better people in the future, that's also a belief that in the present, we¬†_can_.\n\n#### Origin of Life on Planets\n- In the previous Module, we discussed the diversity of life-forms on science fiction planets, with an emphasis on how evolution explains this biodiversity. Let's now look at how all of this life could begin on a planet in the first place. As I'm sure you've come to appreciate by now, evolution plays a very important role in that as well.\n- Not a lot of sci-fi goes so far as to explain the origins of their home-world and the beginning of life on them. Perhaps not surprisingly, this is usually important only in sci-fi universes that are featured across several novels, with the books showcasing different planets and species. In this way, the origin of life in these universes serves as an explanation and common thread for the diversity in the books. \n\t- In such sci-fi universes, ==the shared origin of species can be considered its own¬†_novum_.== \n\t- The two most apparent examples are Larry Niven's¬†_Known Space Universe_¬†and Ursula Le Guin's¬†_Hainish Cycle_. What they have in common is the idea of a ==hyper-advanced species intentionally seeding other planets.== We actually have a term for that in biology:¬†**directed panspermia**. Why does biology have a term for a trope in science fiction? Well, that's because panspermia isn't completely sci-fi.\n- Before we go into how¬†_life_¬†can begin on a planet, let's first talk about what types of planets can have life in the first place. For that, we need to begin with what provides the energy for the sustenance of life on any world: the stars. **[Episode 7 - World-building 101: O M G! Star Classes and Life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxwQ9tYKIIU)**\n\t- So, not all stars are viable candidates for hosting planets that have life. You might want to keep this in mind when creating your own sci-fi world.\n\n**Points for Discussion**\n1. What types are of stars are most likely to host life on their satellite planets? Why?\n2. Do you think sci-fi authors should be more deliberate in identifying the type of host star of their created worlds? Why or why not?\n\n- So now you have your host star. For obvious reasons, a great majority of sci-fi takes place on rocky planets, but of course there's nothing stopping you from creating one that happens entirely on a gaseous planet! \n- However, the environmental conditions (i.e. gasses, rocks, minerals, water availability, pressure, gravity, temperature, etc.) on your planet would definitely matter in shaping the life that evolves on that planet, because those environmental conditions will serve as the¬†**evolutionary pressures**¬†that will determine the ==survivability== of the various life-forms. \n- But even before we talk about the evolution of life, we have to explore first how life could begin in the first place in a barren, lifeless world. Did life on a planet come from pre-existing life outside the planet (**panspermia**), or did it develop¬†_in situ_¬†from non-living environmental components? Or is it some combination of the two? Watch this next video for an overview of the well-accepted ideas on how life could have began on our own planet: **[Episode 20 - World-Building 101: How Life Can Begin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAyvAiJooPo)**\n- In many ways, panspermia is the most exciting among the three origin hypotheses given the extraterrestrial source and even the possibility of a hyper-intelligent alien species having a hand in our beginnings! \n\t- So it shouldn't be surprising that Niven's and Le Guin's universes are built on that idea. \n\t- Heck, even the anime mega-franchise¬†_Neon Genesis Evangelion_¬†uses it to explain the origins of humans, Evangelions, and Angels!¬†\n\t- In the episode of¬†_Star Trek: The Next Generation_¬†entitled \"The Chase,\" which is one of our primary references for this Module, panspermia is also used as an explanation for the diversity of intelligent life in the¬†_Star Trek_¬†universe.\n\n**Points for Discussion**\n1. Think of a¬†_novum_¬†for one of the three origin hypotheses OR your own \"origin of life\"¬†_novum_.¬†\n2. How does \"The Chase\" use panspermia to support the bigger themes that the¬†_Star Trek_¬†franchise has been exploring?\n\n#### Genetics and Evolution\n##### A Brief Review of Basic Genetics\n![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20230209163611.png]]\n- You've likely heard it said before: ==our genes determine who we are.¬†==\n- **Genes**¬†are found on chromosomes (those things in the nucleus that move around and are split apart during mitosis, which all of you know) and are made up of, among others,¬†**DNA**¬†(deoxyribonucleic acid), which structurally consists of a sugar (carbohydrate, one of the four organic compounds), a phosphate group, and four¬†**nitrogenous bases**, namely adenine (A), cytostine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T). DNA contains the information on who we are as a species and as an individual, primarily depending on the sequence of those nitrogenous bases.¬†\n- How does that actually work? The short of it is this:\n\t- In¬†**replication**, the double-stranded, helical DNA molecule unwinds and each strand becomes independent of the other, thus leaving each strand to bind with another strand. But because of the unique pairing of bases (adenine with thymine and cytosine with guanine, as seen in the topmost figure), ==the resulting two DNA molecules are identical to the parent DNA molecule.== This DNA replication is what happens during S phase of interphase prior to mitosis and is the main way by which genetic material is copied from parent cell to daughter cell.\n\t- During a process called¬†**transcription**, one strand of an unwound DNA molecule binds not with another strand of DNA but with a strand of¬†**RNA**¬†(ribonucleic acid), a different type of nucleic acid from DNA. Specifically, this RNA is called¬†**messenger RNA**¬†or¬†**mRNA**. Like DNA, it consists of a sugar, a phosphate group, and four nitrogenous bases, but instead of thymine it has uracil (U). It's the unique pairing of adenine to uracil and of guanine to cytosine that allows the binding of two strands of nucleic acids. The mRNA molecule will detach from the DNA strand that it used as a template so that it can move to the next step.\n\t- During¬†**translation**, the mRNA strand, being on its own and thus capable of binding with another nucleic acid strand, binds with another RNA molecule, but this time it's¬†**transfer RNA**¬†or¬†**tRNA**. There are two very important things to note in this process: \n\t\t1) tRNA binds to the mRNA template in clusters of three nitrogenous bases (e.g. AUG, GGU, CGA, etc.) called a¬†**triplet codon**¬†\n\t\t2) each tRNA triplet codon brings with it an¬†**amino acid**¬†(like glutamic acid, serine, lysine, methionine, etc.), which is the building block of proteins. \n\t\t3) So essentially, an mRNA template will produce a string of amino acids whose identity is determined by the specific triplet codon. For example, AUG always codes for methionine. This coding system, which we believe to be universal to all life (at least all carbon-based life!), is called the¬†**genetic code**. When the amino acids are strung together and detach from the tRNA molecules that had carried them, we now have a¬†**polypeptide**¬†or more commonly referred to as a protein.\n![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20230209163933.png]]\n\n- What's the importance of producing proteins from the specific DNA base sequence? \n\t- In many ways, ==our protein make-up determines who we are==, because proteins are extremely important structural components (i.e. they make up or muscles, hair, nails, cell membranes, skin, eyes, etc.), are used as enzymes (which catalyze chemical reactions, including those involved in transcription and translation), and even determine our behaviors, which are mediated by specific pairings between proteins and cell receptors! \n\t- These processes involving DNA coding for our protein make-up is so central to our genetic identity and physical traits that collectively, they are referred to as ==the¬†**Central Dogma**¬†of molecular biology.==\n\n##### Biological Evolution\n-  One good definition of evolution is¬†==_gradual genetic change at the population level_.== Let's dissect that definition. \n\t- Evolution is, first and foremost, ==change.== Organisms change over time; they are not static. Most of these changes are accounted for by¬†**mutations**, which are ==random (i.e. unpredictable) changes in our genes== (such as in the sequence of our nitrogenous bases, and now you can appreciate what that would mean!). \n\t- By gradual, we mean not necessarily that evolution takes a very long time (some evolutionary events have taken only decades!), but that it's usually ==an accumulation of small, incremental changes== instead of one big sudden mutation. \n\t\t- For example, the evolution of amphibians from fish involved independent changes in the shape of the head, the development of the ribs, the position of the eyes, the shaping of the limb bones, etc. We say it's genetic change because only traits that can be passed from one generation to the next (i.e. heritable) can be subject to evolution. \n\t- And lastly, individuals do not evolve. If you suddenly grow wings, sorry but you ain't evolving, my friend! Evolution works on the level of the¬†**population**, which is ==a group of organisms of the same species living together in the same place and interbreeding.== We see this through changes in the frequencies of¬†**alleles**¬†in a population over time. \n\t\t- Simply put, alleles are alternative forms of genes. For example, the gene for seed color can have the yellow allele and the green allele. If there has been a significant change in the proportions of alleles in a population (i.e. the number of individuals bearing the alleles) over time, then evolution is happening.\n- Here's a very good example to illustrate that: there is a species of moth that's quite common in North American and European forests called the peppered moth (_Biston betularia_). There are commonly two forms: the white¬†_B. betularia_¬†f.¬†_typica_¬†bearing the allele for white coloration and the black¬†_B. betularia_¬†f.¬†_carbonaria_¬†bearing the allele for black coloration. \n\t- Prior to the industrial revolution, when the air was much cleaner and the trees' trunks were covered in lichen and thus gave them a white color, the white form was much more common than the black, having allele frequencies of 0.80 (i.e. 80% of individuals have the allele and are thus white) or higher. \n\t- This was because white moths that perched on the tree trunks blended with their surroundings, whereas the black moths stood out like a sore thumb. Guess what the birds ate? The frequency of the black allele was so low because most black moths were being eaten before they could mate, produce offspring, and pass on their alleles for black color to the next generation!\n\t- But when the industrial revolution created soot and ash that over centuries killed the lichen and coated the tree trunks, thus darkening them, the fates of the two forms were reversed: now it was the white ones that stood out and were being eaten by the predatory birds. This caused a drastic reversal in the allele frequencies, with the black moths becoming much more dominant. Thus, this is evolution at work on the population level. And bird predation was the major evolutionary pressure here (though human activity had its part in influencing the evolutionary trajectory of the species).\n![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20230209164319.png]]\n\n- That, my friends, is evolution in a nutshell, particularly Darwinian evolution (named after the man Charles Darwin, who introduced us to the concept of¬†**variation**).¬†\n- **Natural selection**¬†is but one of several mechanisms for evolution but it's the most popular one. It's based on ==competition for resources and the consistent differences in the fitness of individuals in an environment==; some individuals are more fit than others, and thus they will outcompete others and survive. \n\t- Biologically speaking,¬†**fitness**¬†is ==the ability of an organism to reproduce and pass on its genes to the next generation.== Traits that raise fitness are called¬†**adaptations**.¬†\n\t- So in the¬†_B. betularia_¬†example, the white form had higher fitness prior to the industrial revolution, then the black form had higher fitness after its onset; their colors were adaptations against bird predation. As you can imagine, the fitness of an individual or of a group of individuals will depend on what's happening to the environment at any given moment. ==So what's fit at one time will not necessarily be fit all the time, and the strongest and largest aren't always the fittest!== That's what makes the term \"survival of the fittest\" rather problematic.\n- One very good way to understand more about what evolution is is to understand what it¬†**is not**. Watch **[Episode 5 - How Pop Culture Usually Gets Science and Evolution Wrong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-T7rzM5pis)**\n\n**Points for Discussion**\n1. Relate panspermia to evolution in explaining the diversity of species coming from the same origin in sci-fi universes.\n2. Relate the concept of fitness to the Evolutionary Arms Race.\n3. Relate the concept of the niche to what you've just learned in evolution.\n4. What does \"The Chase\" say about DNA and evolution that is not necessarily consistent with the widely accepted biological views?\n5. What ideas have¬†_you_¬†had about evolution that you now know are misconceptions?\n\n## Discerning Life Questions\n#DLQ10 \n\u003e **Articulating Your Life Question** + 300-word explanation\n\n**\"Why do I constantly feel anguish when it comes to dance?\"**\n\nOutline:\n- dance is my main passion\n- however, it is also a huge source of stress for me\n- recount what happened in the past year\n\nI consider dance as one of my core passions in life. Ever since I decided to pursue it seriously half a decade ago, it has been an integral part of my identity and lifestyle. My day isn't complete without going to a dance class, training with teammates, or simply exercising on my own. And so many of my most treasured relationships ‚Äî friends and mentors ‚Äî came from dance. However, it has also been a huge source of stress for me. Most of the traumatic experiences I've had are related to dance, such as the following: failing to make the competition team in high school three years in a row, and having to leave my old dance studio, which turned out to be a toxic environment. To be honest, I feel like I'm struggling as a member of CADs right now; in this past year, I got rejected from most of the org opportunities I applied for (e.g. deputy positions, competition team line-ups, involvement in core projects). This all leads me to enaging with various negative impulses: comparing myself to others, self-flagellation, resentment, etc. While I still want to keep dance in my life, I also wish to have a healthier relationship with it.

In his inspirational talk, Guy Winch tells us that ==‚Äúyou can‚Äôt treat a psychological wound if you don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre injured‚Äù.== Guy teaches us a lesson on why it is so important to practice emotional hygiene.\n\n- Types of Psychological Wounds\n\t- **Loneliness**\n\t\t- [[Loneliness creates a deep psychological wound]] -- one that distorts our perceptions and scrambles our thinking. \n\t\t\t- It makes us believe that those around us care much less than they actually do.\n\t\t\t- It makes us really afraid to reach out because why set yourself up for rejection and heartache when your heart is already aching more than you can stand?\n\t\t- Happens even when you're surrounded by people. Why? Loneliness is defined purely ==subjectively.==\n\t\t\t- It depends solely on whether you feel emotionally or socially disconnected from those around you\n\t\t- Loneliness can kill you\n\t\t- It's important to ==pay attention to emotional pain== because psychological wounds are also capable of killing you. But you can't treat them if you don't know that you're injured in the first place.\n\t- **Failure**\n\t\t- We all have a ==default set of feelings and beliefs== that gets triggered whenever we encounter frustrations and setbacks\n\t\t- Our mind is hard to change once we become convinced\n\t\t\t- So it might be very natural to feel demoralized and defeated after you fail but you cannot allow yourself to become convinced you can't succeed\n\t\t\t- You have to fight feelings of helplessness you have to gain control over the situation and you have to break this kind of negative cycle before it begins\n\t- **Rejection**\n\t\t- [[Cards/Stop emotional bleeding]]\n\t\t\t- Our minds and feelings aren't as trustworthy as we'd like them to be\n\t\t\t- After a rejection, we usually start thinking of all our faults and all our shortcomings, what we wish we were, what we wish we weren't...\n\t\t\t- Our self-esteem is already hurting; why would we want to go and damage it even further?\n\t\t\t- We exacerbate our psychological injuries because of poor emotional hygeine \n\t\t\t- Instead, the first thing you should be doing after a rejection is ==reviving your self-esteem==\n\t- **Ruminate**\n\t\t- Protect your self-esteem\n\t\t\t- When you're in emotional pain, you have to ==treat yourself with the same compassion== you would expect from a truly good friend\n\t\t\t- We have to catch our unhealthy psychological habits, one of which is rumination (a.k.a. replaying/dwelling on upsetting events)\n\t\t\t- Spending so much time on negative thoughts makes you more vulnerable to alcoholism, depression, eating disorders, etc.\n\t\t\t- Studies show that even a two-minute distraction is sufficient to break the urge to ruminate in that moment.\n- Takeaway: by taking action when you're lonely, by changing your responses to failure, by protecting your self-esteem, by battling negative thinking, you won't just heal your psychological wounds -- you will build ==emotional resilience.==\n\n### Stress\nWhile¬†**emotional hygiene**¬†is something that happens¬†_within_¬†us,¬†**stress**¬†is something that happens¬†_to_¬†us from without.¬†\nThus, it would also be good to talk about stress--but in a different and more constructive way:\n**[How to make stress your friend | Kelly McGonigal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGyVTAoXEU)**\n\u003e Stress. It makes your heart pound, your breathing quicken and your forehead sweat. But while stress has been made into a public health enemy, new research suggests that stress may only be bad for you if you believe that to be the case. Psychologist Kelly McGonigal urges us to see stress as a positive, and introduces us to an unsung mechanism for stress reduction: ==reaching out to others.==\n\n- Mindblowing study insights\n\t- ==People who experienced a lot of stress but did not view stress as harmful== were no more likely to die; in fact, they had the lowest risk of dying of anyone in the study, including people who had relatively little stress.\n\t- 182 000 americans died prematurely not from stress but from the ==belief== that stress is bad for you.\n- When you change your ==mind== about stress, you can change your ==body's response== to stress.\n- Oxytocin\n\t- also known as ==\"the cuddle hormone\"== because it is released whenever you hug someone\n\t- oxytocin is a neurohormone it fine-tunes your brain's social instincts it primes you to do things that strengthen close relationships\n\t- oxytocin makes you crave physical contact with your friends and family itenhances your empathy it even makes you more willing to help and support the people you care about\n\t- What most people don't know: oxytocin is a stress hormone\n\t\t- when oxytocin is released, it is motivating you to seek support. Your biological stressresponse is nudging you to tell someone how you feel instead of bottling it up. Your stress response wants to make sure you notice when someone else in your life is struggling so that you can support each other when life is difficult. Your stress response wants you to be surrounded by people who care about you.\n\t\t- oxytocin doesn't only act on your brain it also acts on your body and one of its main roles in your body is to protect your cardiovascular systemfrom the effects of stress\n\t- Your stress response has a built-in mechanism for stress resilience and that mechanism is ==human connection==. [[Human connection is the built-in mechanism for stress resilience]]\n- Takeaways\n\t- When you choose to view your stress response as helpful, you create the ==biology of courage==\n\t- When you choose to connect with others under stress, you can create resilience.

To guide our thinking in this module, we will anchor our discussions on this essential question¬†==**\"Who is an educated person?\"**==\n\n#### What if you lived during the middle ages?\nThere are 2 themes that describe the backdrop for Medieval education:\n1. **Moral Degeneracy**\n\t1. Prior to this time, the Early Christian Church was born. However, (and Jesus would not have been happy about this) the church grew much in terms of structure and rituals, but have often fallen short in terms of moral practice. \n\t2. It was present as an institution but it focused more on the ==ceremonies== than on living a Christlike life.\n2. **Individualistic Feudalism and Rise of the Classes**\n\t1. Kings, knights, lords, slaves, etc. \n\t2. This was also a time when several Kingdoms rose to power where ==a hierarchy of social class== was prominent.\n\nThis video (**[What If You Lived During the Middle Ages?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydXi-KiMv7o)**) gives you a bird's eye view of what life was like during the middle/dark ages.¬† As you watch the video, take note of the following: the ==social classes== that emerged during this period, and the ==knowledge and skills== that were valued by each social class.\n\n\u003e¬†_If you lived during the medieval period, what kind of education would you need not only to survive but to thrive_?\n\nAs you saw in the video, the Medieval times is a mixed bag, but what's clear is that it's given rise to some \"personalities\" that can clue us into what education was like then: ==the monk, the scholastic, the knight and the craftsman.==\n\n### The monk and the scholastic\n_First, we will look into two forms of education that believed in the pursuit of purity and the intellect: [[Monasticism]] and [[Scholasticism]]._\n\n#### The religious men\n- These first two characters in medieval education anchored the conception of an educated man on religious piety, giving rise to two forms of education - [[monasticism]] and scholasticism. \n- If you think about it - ==\"the religious person\" as the educated person is not really an outdated paradigm.== In the Philippines alone a lot of the first schools were established by religious orders (the Jesuits included), and continues to put front and center the ideal Christian as an ideal person, but how similar or different was their perspective then in comparison to the present?\n\n#### The monk: Ora et Labora (Prayer and Labor)\n- When you think of monks, one of the first things that probably come to mind is a ==solitary life. ==\n\t- Remember that one of the contexts that gave birth to this was the ==un-christlike behaviors of Christians. ==\n\t- Therefore, one of the big ideas of Monasticism is to ==stay away from things that are \"worldly\". ==Thus, the seclusion. \n- So, if [[monasticism]] suggests a solitary life, away from the affairs of the world,¬† how could it have influenced education?\n- A starting point is to distinguish between two forms of monasticism - **anchoritic** and the **cenobitic**.¬† \n\t- The **anchoritic** form called for pure seclusion.\n\t- The **cenobitic** form allowed monks to live in small communities and form monasteries. These monasteries were developed into educational institutions.\n\n\u003e _\"The monasteries were the schools, the libraries, the publishing houses, the literary centers, the hospitals, and the workshops of medieval time\" (Wilds and Lottich, 1965)._\n\n##### A Mini Guide to Medieval Monks\nWhat was monastic life like? Here's a brief overview: **[A Mini Guide to Medieval Monks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbT6IkMQxck)**\n\u003e There were many different religious communities in medieval Britain. Many of English Heritage‚Äôs religious sites were once home to one of the four major monastic movements ‚Äì the Benedictines, Cluniacs, Carthusians and Cistercians. But do you know the difference between these religious orders?\n- **Benedictines**\n\t- At the core of the Benedictine day was communal prayer; everyday the monks gathered in church to sing eight services\n\t- Time was also set aside for reading and manual work\n\t- Monasteries also had an obligation to offer hospitality to travellers and alms to the poor\n\t- The Rule of St. Benedict was summed up with the motto \"Pray and Work\"\n- **Cluniacs**\n\t- The Cluniacs wanted a grander style of worship. So their interpretation of the Rule called for a celebration of God through beautiful art, architecture, and elaborate services.\n\t- Servants did most of the manual labor\n- **Cistercians**\n\t- The Cluniac life was too opulent for the Cistercians\n\t- Monasteries were plain and secluded\n\t- Services were shorter, and they farmed and carried out their own manual labor\n\t- Aim: simpler, more austere spiritual life\n- **Carthusians**\n\t- The most austere out of all the orders\n\t- Wore hooded robes, only came together for a few services each day, and unlike other orders, lived and prayed in solitary cells\n- Henry VIII suddenly dissolved all the moansteries; this forced those who committed to religious communities to step out into an uncertain future\n\n##### The 6 Key Features of [[Monasticism]] Lecture\n- [[Monasticism]] comes from the Greek word ***monos***, meaning **alone**.\n\t- Sets the context for [[Monasticism]], since this is a form of education born from the experiences of monks who secluded themselves from the rest of society\n- 6 Key Features\n\t- **Aim:** ==\"salvation of individual souls\"== \n\t\t- Context: this type of education was a response to the degrading quality of Christianity\n\t\t- Through... (methods)\n\t\t\t- Bodily mortification\n\t\t\t- World renunciation -- chastity, poverty, obedience \n\t\t\t\t- Described as **[[Cards/Ascetism]]:** the ==disciplining== of all ==bodily desires== and ==all human affections and aspirations== so that the mind and soul might be devoted to the interests of the higher life.\n\t\t\t\t- This works with the assumption that the higher life cannot mix with the worldly life\n\t- **Type:** Moral and Religious education\n\t\t- Types of training\n\t\t\t- Literary Training: reading, copying, and writing of manuscripts\n\t\t\t- Manual Training: agriculture (for men), skilled artisanship (wood, metal, leather), embroidery\n\t\t- Motivation behind these\n\t\t\t- Rule of Benedict: \"==Idleness is the great enemy== of the soul, therefore the monks shall always be occupied either in manual labor or holy reading\"\n\t- **Content:** Seven Liberal Arts (grammar, rhetoric, dialectic, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, music)\n\t\t- Also done in service of the church/religion\n\t\t\t- \"The novitates were required to learn to ==read== in order to ==study the sacred books==; to ==write== in order to ==copy manuscripts==; to ==sing== in order to take part in ==religious ceremonies==; and to ==calculate== so that they could ==compute the time of the church festivals==\"\n\t- **Agency \u0026 Organization:** Monastic schools\n\t\t- Boys admitted at age 10, and enters the order at 18\n\t\t- Later on, \"outsiders\" were admitted too *(interni v.s. externi)*\n\t\t\t- Externi: those coming from the external world\n\t\t\t- Interni: those who decided to stay to continue living a religious life\n\t- **Method:**\n\t\t- Cathethical: question \u0026 answer method\n\t\t- Dictation: since they had limited copies of the manuscripts\n\t\t- Meditation \u0026 Contemplation\n\t\t- Corporal Punishment (use of the rod)\n- Takeaway question: Who was the **educated person** in [[Monasticism]]?\n- Finally, to deepen your understanding, read more about Monastic Education, you may do so in¬†this excerpt.\n\n\n\u003e 1. What feature of Monastic Education did you find most interesting? Include a brief quote from the text about this.\n\u003e 2. Describe the educated person in monastic education.\n\nWhat I found most interesting about Monastic Education was the motivation behind keeping the monks constantly busy. This was because they worried that having too much free time could make one vulnerable to \"tempation or brooding\". As declared by the Rule of Benedict: \"Idleness is the great enemy of the soul.\" I can't help but think of how similar this aim is to modern productivity culture, where people try to optimize their time in order to do as much as possible; workaholics like me are most guilty of this.\n\nThe educated person in monastic education is a single-minded devotee. Similar to the Spartans, who dedicated their whole lives to the state, educated monks dedicated their whole lives to God. They sacrificed their bodies (through phsical torment) and relationships (with the home, economy, and state); they   believed that this would free them from worldy tempations, which would allow them to fully focus on studying and serving God (which can be seen in the purely religious content of their education).\n\n#### The scholastic: Faith and Reason\n\u003e Let's start this section with this question:¬†What is the relationship of **faith** and **reason?**\n\n![[Extras/Media/Images/Look at something beautiful for a long time.png]]\n\n- The late middle period (11th to 12th century) was a time of peace and¬† intellectual activities.¬† People now began to speculate about Church doctrines, which were previously accepted unquestioningly. This resulted in pursuing theology with more vigor and hence the start of scholasticism as a movement.¬† [[Scholasticism]] aimed to ==support the doctrines of the church using rational argument.==\n- Malik Shawal in his article¬†[Scholasticism: Nature, Purpose and Method of Education](https://www.yourarticlelibrary.com/education/scholasticism-nature-purpose-and-method/69156)provides an overview of the educational system that developed during this period.\n- One of the prominent characters in Scholasticism is St. Anselm of Canterbury, a Christian Philosopher and Theologian. Here's one of his famous quotes:\n\t- ![[Extras/Media/Images/Anselm of Canterbury.png]]\n\t- As you read the quote above, think about how similar or different this point of view is with the monks of Monastic education. For the scholastics, [[Faith and reason need not be worlds apart]].\n- Definition of [[Scholasticism]]\n\t- The word ‚Äúscholasticism‚Äù has its roots in the Latin word ‚Äúschola‚Äù which means school. \n\t- In Latin medieval universities, the heads of the schools are called ‚Äúmagistris scholarum‚Äù (masters of the schools) or simply ‚Äúscholastici‚Äù (scholastics or schoolmen). \n\t- During the Medieval times, the scholastici were recognized as the bearers of authentic philosophical and theological views\n- 6 Key Features of [[Scholasticism]]\n\t- **Aim:** intellectual discipline (faith seeking understanding)\n\t\t- The aim of Scholasticism was mainly to be able to ==defend the faith through reason.== This was a response to ==heretics of the church that questioned belief based on faith alone.==\n\t\t- \"Scholastic education sought also to develop the ability to ==formulate beliefs into logical systems== and to ==defend these against any intellectual arguments==\"\n\t\t- Another prominent figure in this time was St. Thomas Aquinas. [One of the most famous prayers attributed to him](https://www.thereligionteacher.com/saint-thomas-aquinas-prayer-before-study/) speaks volumes of what the scholastics believed in.\n\t- **Types \u0026 Content:** Theology and Religious Philosophy (new system of philosophizing about theological beliefs)\n\t\t- Mainly influenced by [Thomas Aquinas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJvoFf2wCBU)\n\t\t- Developed a new understanding of theplace of Reason in human life\n\t\t- His monumental contribution was to teach Western European civilization that ==any human being== (not just a Christian) could have ==access to great truths== whenever they made use of God's greatest gift to human beings: ==reason==\n\t\t\t- He thus universalized intelligence, explaining how one could have both wisdom and no faith in God\n\t\t- The modern world, in so far as it insists that good ideas can come from any quarter regardless of creed or background, remains hugely in Aquinas' debt. \n\t\t\t- This is because he opened the Christian mind to the insights of all of humanity from across the ages and the continents\n\t\t- He proposed that the world could be explored through reason, and not just through faith\n\t\t- He did this by proposing that the universe and all its dynamics operate according to two kinds of law: ==(secular) natural law== and ==(religious) eternal law.==\n\t\t\t- Related to Philo class?\n\t\t- \"Do unto others what you would have done to you\" belongs to natural law, not eternal law\n\t\t\t- this explains how it was a moral cornerstrone even outside of religion\n\t\t- While God can work through eternal law (e.g. miracles), most useful knowledge can be found within the realms of natural law\n\t\t- Ensured that radicalization wouldn't harm intellectual culture (compared to what happened with Islam)\n\t\t- Though Aquinas was a man of deep faith, he provided a philosophical framework for open scientific inquiry; he reminds us that knowledge can and should come from multiple sources (i.e. intuition and rationality, science and revelation, pagans and monks)\n\t- **Agencies:** cathedral schools, monastic schools, universities\n\t\t- Apart from Scholasticism naturally finding its way to Monastic and Cathedral Schools, one of the important contributions of scholastic education is the development of [medieval universities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ly9BPvFJfqo).\n\t- **Methods:** lecture (dictation), debate, syllogism\n\t\t- There were two prominent teaching methods in Scholasticism: The (all too familiar) Lecture - where teachers read text together with students and debates - where a thesis was proposed and objections were raised and refuted.\n\t\t- One of the favorite forms of argument was [syllogism](https://youtu.be/1UmPbfuGfKk) - a form of reasoning that is composed of 3 propositions - a major premise, a minor premise and a conclusion.\n","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.731605397Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2023-02-14":{"title":"2023-02-14","content":"## Biology of Science Fiction\n#BIO21i #biology #sciencefiction\n### On Human Evolution and Speciation\n- In the 1930 sci-fi classic Last and First Men by Olaf Stapledon, Homo sapiens undergoes drastic evolutionary processes throughout its history that ultimately results in no less than 17 descendant species, with the fourth of those onward being found on other planets, namely Venus and Neptune. Is this the future of our species? Are we even still evolving? Yes, we are still evolving. But not our species as a whole! \n- Remember that ==evolution works on the level of a **population**, which is a group of individuals living together.== Of course, our various modes of transportation complicate that definition and virtually prevent total isolation of any one human population, but the distinction is important. There have been several documented cases of human evolution, such as the following:\n  - Tibetans, living in very high altitudes where there is less oxygen in the air, have more efficient oxygen-utilization mechanisms;\n  - The Buriat tribe of very cold Siberia have wider than normal skulls at the forehead, which by virtue of resulting in a smaller surface area:volume ratio causes less heat to escape through the head;\n  - Certain native African tribes develop a non-lethal form of sickle cell anemia that protects them from malaria;\n  - Alpine dairy-farming communities in Europe have 1.0 frequency for the allele for lactase, allowing them to digest lactose in milk unlike most other people in the world;\n  - The Bajau, who have been free diving for subsistence for a thousand years, have larger than average (as much 50% larger!) spleens, which recycle red blood cells and hold a reserve of blood.\n- These are just a few of the most fascinating and well known examples. As the Bajau example shows you, ==these evolutionary trends can take a relatively short period of time.== \n  - Dairy-farming communities evolved the lactase gene in around 5,000 years. For a species that is only around 200,000 years old, it's important to note these quick evolutionary rates. \n  - Also take note that these are evolutionary events occurring independently in certain human populations; they are not all happening concurrently in all humans! That's what we mean by evolution working on the population level.\n- There has been the question of whether or not the human species is still driven by natural selection the way other organisms are. \n  - Certainly, there are things we can do that other species can't in response to environmental change, such as locking ourselves in a well-stocked, air-conditioned bunker during a nuclear holocaust that will kill most other species. \n  - But as we've seen with the examples above, evolutionary pressures are still working on certain human populations. \n  - Many biologists speculate that disease may be the greatest evolutionary pressure molding our trajectory, with resistance to disease being selected for. This is very timely given the situation that we find ourselves in now.\n- Now let's talk about [[Cards/Speciation]]. Recall: evolution and [[Cards/Speciation]] are NOT the same process. \n  - As we've seen with Biston betularia, evolution can happen without [[Cards/Speciation]]. The mutants of X-Men may be products of evolution but they're not necessarily a new species. \n  - Yes, humans are currently evolving but there is no evidence to suggest that any one human population is speciating. Recall: in order for speciation to occur, there should be reproductive isolation. Rarely is any human group so completely cut-off from the rest of humanity that such isolation can take place.\n\n#### _The Time Machine_\n- Our key reference for this topic is The Time Machine (1895) by H.G. Wells, which supposes that H. sapiens has evolved into two offshoot species: the Eloi and the Morlocks.\n- In the timeless classic, the protagonist (simply called the Traveller), creates a time machine and with it zooms to the future, 802701 AD to be precise. At this time, it seems that H. sapiens as we know it no longer exists, at least in far-future London. \n  - (Who knows what the rest of the world looks like? As we have learned, it's populations that evolve, not entire species, so it's possible that there's still H. sapiens elsewhere on the globe.) \n- In London and probably throughout Great Britain, the pleasant, indolent Eloi live on the surface while the monstrous and cunning Morlocks live underground. Given the absence of H. sapiens, it's reasonable to suspect that both species are offshoots of humans, especially considering that 800,000 years is definitely enough time for speciation to have occurred, as long as there was sufficient reproductive isolation between the two formerly human populations.\n- What could have caused this reproductive isolation? Obviously, it involved keeping one population of humans above the surface and casting away another population below the ground. \n  - Physically, the Eloi represent current humans much more closely than Morlocks do, and the novel makes it a point to emphasize how pretty they are compared to the grotesque, animalistic other. \n  - It's almost impossible not to have a Marxist reading of the book. The distinction between the two new species practically screams \"class struggle!\" \n  - The most obvious sign of this is the presence of the machines underground. Sometime in our future, capitalists force the laborers underground to drive the machinery that keeps the surface world going. \n  - And for the allopatric speciation scenario to work, this means that the laborers weren't just made to work down there and then be able to return to the surface when they're done with work; the Eloi ancestors forced them to stay there! Think miners, but they can't ever leave their place of work. Laws must have been put into place to prevent mixing of the two populations, which could have only meant a social milieu where it became unacceptable for the capitalist elite to interact with the lowly workers. Such a grim future! It's almost completely antithetical to the harmonious future that Star Trek envisions.\n- The physical transformation of the subterranean humans into Morlocks over 800,000 years is typical of speculations on the evolution of animals that are bound to underground habitats. \n  - These animals are called troglobites (a similar word, troglodyte, has been used to refer to humans living in caves and has been co-opted by fantasy literature as a name for any sort of repulsive, barbaric creature, such as in Dungeons \u0026 Dragons). \n  - Typically, troglobites have evolved to have slow metabolism (likely an evolutionary response to the scarcity of food underground compared to above-ground), absence of pigmentation (colors being biologically costly to produce but not useful in caves, whether for display purposes or protection from ultraviolet radiation), and decrease or loss of sight, if not the eyes themselves (which do not fully develop). \n  - The cunning and aggression displayed by the Morlocks, which is atypical of cave denizens, is not surprising given that they are an offshoot of an intelligent species that has had to fight for survival. The cave creature in the excellent 2005 horror film The Descent is another good example of such a creature.\n- In several ways, the Eloi as future human is even more frightening a concept, at least from a biological perspective. Here we have a species that still looks human and yet has lost many of the things that make a human human: strong emotional responses and drives. \n  - The Eloi is a lazy creature reduced to feeding and reproducing out of need, barely stimulated by external forces. In this way, it's easy to argue that Morlocks are even more human. \n  - Eloi seem to have lost even basic survival instincts, which most animals have! \n  - In Wells's view of the world, the capitalists' dependence on and harsh treatment of laborers dehumanizes them, perhaps not physically, but certainly behaviorally.\n  - Honestly, it's difficult to speculate a future where humans reach this level of helpless complacency. Wells's future must have been absolutely utopic (at least above ground), with diseases and senescence and natural disasters a thing of the past, for natural selection to have bred out survival instincts and non-essential desires (which are admittedly energetically costly) from the surface humans! \n  - Anatomically speaking, the Eloi's limbic system (recall: it's the part of the brain that's involved in behavioral and emotional responses, including those critical to survival) is probably quite different from H. sapiens's. Whatever cataclysm caused the collapse of this society left a remnant of humanity (or of Brits, to be specific) that's but a shade of what humans used to be, unable (and even unwilling) to defend themselves against the Morlocks, who are now able to return to the surface.\n\n#### Possible Avenues for Human Speciation\n- Many biologists and futurists seem to believe that there are two major avenues by which humans could possible speciate. **[[Cards/Transhumanism]]** is the ==philosophical movement of human transcendence through technological enhancement such as but not limited to the use of cybernetics.== \n  - This is a common trope in cyberpunk fiction, which include William Gibson's Neuromancer (1984) and the Ghost in the Shell properties as key examples. \n  - More modern technological breakthroughs have allowed the addition of genetic engineering methods as transhumanist innovations. \n    - Orphan Black's Neolution is a group that advocates all of these. \n  - The main advocacy in transhumanism is to ==better the lives of humans through enhancement==, such as replacing lost limbs with synthetic parts or fixing eyesight with cybernetic implants. \n  - But transhumanists are also beginning to advocate doing so even for ==purely cosmetic purposes==. \n    - It should be clear that speciation is not the main goal here, and in fact most of these tweaks on the human body aren't evolutionary and so cannot result in another species...unless the tweaking extends to the germ line, or those cells (i.e. gametes) that can pass on genetic changes to the offspring. \n      - CRISPR-Cas9 is an astounding technological breakthrough that allows edit parts of the human genome for potentially an insanely large amount of applications. If these changes are made in ==the germ line==, such changes coupled with reproductive isolation may result in speciation. \n- Speaking of reproductive isolation, it's much easier to imagine how an ==intergalactic diaspora or migration== would result in speciation. \n  - Imagine humans eventually colonizing other moons and planets in our galaxy or even outside it. The space between Earth and any of those moons or planets is the largest geographical barrier imaginable! \n  - And then each moon or planet will subject the colonists to unique evolutionary pressures that will favor particular adaptations over time. \n  - **Reproductive isolation** and **adaptations** are two key ingredients for speciation. \n  \n #### Points for Discussion\n1. Discuss human evolution and disease in the context of the Evolutionary Arms Race.\n2. What do you imagine will be a specific transhumanist trajectory that will result in the origination of new descendant species from Homo sapiens?\n3. What type of speciation will likely result from intergalactic diaspora?\n4. What do you think are other ways by which H. sapiens can give rise to a new species?\n5. How likely do you think The Time Machine's speculation of the future humans is?\n\n### Star Trek (\"The Chase\") - Image and Likeness\n- The Star Trek: The Next Generation episode \"The Chase\" unfolds in classic Star Trek fashion: ==science and exploration used as the scaffolding for philosophical inquiry.==\n- Narratively, \"The Chase\" is ==a science fiction take on the creation myth==: a story about a group of people that explains their history. And in the same way that science fiction about the future is really about the present, ==creation myths are stories we tell about the past to explain ourselves to ourselves in the present.== \n  - The story of Adam and Eve, for example, tells Christians that they have a God who loves them, but that they were disobedient and shunned that love. \n  - For the Greeks, the story of how the Olympian gods overthrew the Titans to become the reigning pantheon is a story about how the world is ruled by conflict and children rebelling against their parents. And so it goes, and so it goes.\n- Scientifically, the central novum of \"The Chase\"--the advanced precursor race that happens to look like many of the races in Star Trek--is a take on ==the idea of life arriving on our planet through being seeded== (a.k.a. panspermia). \n  - The idea that we might have been created by a higher power together with all other life on Earth is not new--see: religion--but \"The Chase\" hyperbolizes this, exploring the notion that ==we might even share a common creator with aliens from other worlds.== \n\nSo, game--let's look at what's going on here. Respond to any of the following questions!\n1. From a storytelling perspective, why do you think the program had to be encoded in DNA? What does this do for the ideas the story is trying to forward?\n2. What assumptions did the precursors have about the life that would come after them? Based on the actions of the various characters and factions in the episode, do you think they were right?\n3. Professor Galen says the discovery he's working on will shake galactic civilization to its core. Let's say this knowledge becomes widespread in the Star Trek universe. What do you think will happen? (You don't need to invoke any extra Star Trek knowledge beyond what's in this episode, but Trekkies, if you'd like to geek out, you absolutely can.)\n\n### Sense8 - Mutants and Mindlinks\n- While the psychic/empathic abilities possessed by sensates would seem to lump them in a category together with 99%[citation needed] of science fiction enhanced humans, Sense8 limits and nuances its specific version of an otherwise-well-worn novum in a really interesting way, making the sensate power set and narrative a very specific one: these aren't mind readers, coercives, or brainwashers, just otherwise-normal people ==capable of communicating with each other and borrowing skills from each other.==\n- In terms of affecting the outside world, nothing any sensate does is in any way superhuman, but in terms of their inner lives, ==the sensate experience is infinitely more complex than our own==, and this is something reflected in how the series is put together.\n- Sense8 is a science fiction property that employs something called the **mutant metaphor**: the trope of people born with ==extraordinary powers== being used as a metaphor for ==real-world conditions of marginalization and oppression.== \n  - We'll look at the most iconic example, the X-Men, later in the semester, but Sense8's shadowy sensate-hunting organization neatly fills the role of persecutor in this show, particularly in the second season. \n  - With texts like this, especially with a diverse ensemble cast, it's worth looking at the ways in which the ==mutation functions as both source of power and site of oppression==--the way the sensate connection allows Whispers to track Will, for example, but also allows Will to receive support from his cluster.\n- Beyond that, though, it's also necessary to examine the sensate mindlink itelf as the central novum of the text. We know it's a superpower, and often we tend to kind of gloss over superpowers as literary devices (especially in our superhero-saturated world where everyone's got a power), but the sensate ability is both very specific and much more ==semiotically rich== than, say, the ability to shoot heat beams from your eyes. \n  - Consider both Marvel's Luke Cage and Heroes' D. L. Hawkins, both Black men and ex-convicts--victims of the highly racialized criminal justice system in the United States--whose superpowers (invulnerability and intangibility, respectively) make them Black men who cannot be shot, a powerful image in a world where so many young Black men die in exactly that way. \n  - Or look at Jessica Cruz, DC's first human female Green Lantern, seemingly a walking paradox in that she wields a ring powered by willpower but is afraid to leave the house--her whole deal is that she's traumatized and agoraphobic, so unlike the former soldiers and cocky test pilots who are her senior Lanterns, to her, even leaving her apartment proves to her ring that she can \"overcome great fear.\"\n- Sense8 then is a wonderful text for examining identity, power, and the intersections of the two, ==the ways in which the site of our suffering can also be what saves us==--whether it's how we look, who we love, or what superpowers we wield--and how even superhuman abilities can be fertile ground for discourse and critical exploration.\n\nSo! Discussion questions; as usual, answer any or all.\n1. If the novum of the sensate superpower uses telepathy and mind-linking as the signifier, what exactly is being signified? What concept or capability is being heightened and hyperbolized to create the sensate experience?\n2. Do you have a favorite sensate? If so, fanboy/fangirl/fanperson over them for a bit. (Mark spoilers if you've seen episodes other than the one we've given you. But also help us convince your classmates to watch this show.)\n3. If sensates were real, would you want to be one? Why or why not? (Assume no shadowy sensate-hunting organization exists.)\n4. Discuss the potential of sensates for speciation.\n\n### The Time Machine - The End of Humanity\n- If Sense8 concerns itself with a fictional subspecies of humanity that might be living alongside us in the present, and Star Trek concerns itself with humanity's ancestry--our ultimate past--then The Time Machine, perhaps unsurprisingly, concerns itself with our future: the question of where we're going. \n  - This is very much the stuff of classic science fiction, but we're saving it for last in this module for two reasons: one, it's our first novel, so we figured you might want more time to read it, and two, we wanted to make a point: ==all this stuff is contextual.== ==The future in science fiction, along with the past, remains very much rooted in the present.==\n- **Class-based human speciation:** Wells' novel posits that in the year 802,701 A.D., humanity will have split into two different species: the Eloi, the lethargic and childlike above-ground species which the Time Traveler believes to be the descendents of the bourgeoisie upper class, and the Morlocks, the apelike, cave-dwelling creatures that the Time Traveler thinks evolved from the working class. Through the Time Traveler's interactions with both species, he reflects on what might have caused the divide, and on what characteristics from humanity might have remained within each of the descendent species.\n- This is, then, a text in which ==point of view matters a lot.==  \n  - At first glance, the Eloi seem far more sympathetic: they look like us, they wear clothes, they are coded as victims, and so on. \n  - The Morlocks, conversely, look inhuman, move at night, hunt and eat the creatures that look like us--our brain sees them and thinks, \"Monsters!\" \n  - But while the Time Traveler never really leaves that perspective, the text gives us enough hints and evidence for us to ask whether the Eloi truly are the more \"human\" of the two species, and whether the Morlocks might in fact be as human if not more than they are. And once we cross that line, our reading of the Eloi-Morlock dynamic can get a lot more interesting.\n- It's interesting that the text is so explicitly class-based and Marxist in its analysis of what might happen to humanity 800,000 years in the future. \n  - One belief of [[Marxism]] is the idea that [[History is dialectic]], ==driven by class struggle towards the ultimate end of a classless society.== \n  - On the one hand, if we believe the Time Traveler's theory about where the Eloi and Morlocks came from, then class struggle clearly remains even that far in the future, albeit hyperbolized into species war. (Plus, when he goes even further into the future, he sees that version of Earth where the sun is red and everything is crabs, so, hey, classless society!) \n  - But on the other hand, if that's our takeaway, then damn is this a pessimistic future: one in which class conflict runs so deep that it cleaves us into separate species and keeps going, so unlike the utopian future envisioned by Star Trek and texts like it.\n- Evolution is messy and wondrous, and often when we think of human evolution, we imagine where we as a species might go together. But texts like The Time Machine remind us that all our theorizing is ultimately rooted in who we are now, and if we don't account for and address the divides between us, they're not going to stop being there just because we've started dreaming of tomorrow.\n\nBut for now, let's do some reading. Feel free to answer any or all!\n1. How are the Eloi and the Morlocks coded in relation to each other? How does this shape our perceptions of them and the kinds of people they represent?\n2. How is the conflict between the Eloi and the Morlocks rendered? What statements is the text making using this conflict? (And do you agree?)\n3. Could there be an alternative explanation for where the Eloi and/or the Morlocks came from? If so, how would that change your reading of their interactions?\n4. Fan-fiction time! Make up your own story on how Homo sapiens speciated into the Eloi and the Morlocks. What were the major evolutionary forces that led to this split? Bonus question: do you think there are remnants of the original H. sapiens species somewhere in this future world?\n\n### Crimes of the Future - Surgery Is The New Sex\n- This David Cronenberg film depicts a borderline post-apocalyptic future defined by an intriguing central novum whose very premise seems to be rooted in evolution: at some point, ==the humans of the film's setting stopped feeling pain or getting infected with illness.== \n  - If you think this sounds too good to be true, you'd be right--this radical shift in the human condition has led to society (or at least the snippet of society that the film shows us) becoming stricken with a fundamental, fatalistic ennui. Without pain, humankind seems trapped in a self-destructive search for pleasure, often resorting to bodily mutilation in an attempt to feel anything at all.\n- In addition to being post-apocalyptic, the world of Crimes of the Future is incredibly dystopian, in the truest sense of the word. \n  - While in general the term **\"dystopia\"** usually refers to an imagined society which contradicts the author's ethos, often characterized by fear, oppression, and propaganda, some scholars define a specific type of dystopia--the _[[Anti-utopia]]--as something which specifically critiques the concept of utopia. \n  - It's the sort of thinking that leads to the notion of the monkey's paw: ==if we believe that nothing good comes without a commensurate cost, then it follows that the cost of a perfect society must be high indeed, and an anti-utopian dystopia is what happens when the cost is too high.==\n- It's worth pointing out that the \"perfection\" in Crimes of the Future--the absence of pain and infectious disease--doesn't seem to be deliberate on the part of humankind, but rather it's described as ==something that \"happened.\"== The worldbuilding seems to imply that it's the ==product of evolution==, but the text doesn't focus too hard on the history of this novum, opting instead to pay attention to the people and societies it creates.\n  - People are changing in Crimes of the Future, and one of the other nova in the text literalizes that idea even further: people's bodies seem to be developing new structures and processes, many of whose functions are unknown.\n- As a work of social science fiction, the film presents us a society shaped by a particular biological shift in humankind, but suggests pretty heavily that ==that shift itself may be a response to the world humanity created==, the species changing in accordance with the increasingly decadent, derelict world it's constructed for itself, a sort of perverted Red Queen world where we are perpetually adapting to ourselves in a masturbatory, almost cancerous inward spiral. \n  - And by the journey's end, even as some of the mysteries that drive the plot are solved, we're left with more questions about this world than answers--and, like mutations or the search for pleasure or the strange recursive links between biology and society, many of these questions may never fully resolve themselves.\n\nDiscussion time! You know the drill.\n1. Why is the mutation of the boy from the beginning of the movie significant?\n2. Why are the government and the evolutionists at odds? What does this conflict represent in context of the setting?\n3. This film is horny as shit.

It involves developing core psychological resources and becoming aware of how you think, behave, and feel. When you are mentally fit, you lean into challenges and feel able to navigate change and stress, no matter what day-to-day life presents. Mental fitness enables you to reconnect with what it is that you love in your work and your life.\n\u003e Mental fitness is more than the absence of mental illness. It‚Äôs beyond self-care and recovery. It's about growth and thinking, feeling, and performing at your best in all areas of your life. Mental fitness is developed by equipping people to treat¬†[mental health as something that they can strengthen and improve](https://www.betterup.com/en-us/resources/blog/prince-harry-chief-impact-officer?hsLang=en).\n\u003e When you‚Äôre physically not well, you know it ‚Äî the symptoms come on and you know it‚Äôs time to get some sleep (and a cup of tea). When you‚Äôre¬†[experiencing anxiety, depression, or a sense of languish](https://www.betterup.com/en-us/resources/blog/not-ill-not-well-massive-middle?hsLang=en), you don‚Äôt always know it.\n\u003e When it comes to our physical health, many of us aspire for more than just to get back to ‚Äúfine‚Äù ‚Äî that is, the absence of undesirable symptoms. We know that, ==even if we're not ill, we can increase our fitness and health to achieve a goal or level of performance.== Our physical fitness can be integral to our desired way of life.¬†\n\u003e The same can be true of our mental health.¬†[Fine is just fine ‚Äî it‚Äôs not thriving](https://www.betterup.com/en-us/resources/blog/why-fine-is-good-but-not-good-enough?hsLang=en). And that‚Äôs not good enough. With our mental health, we don‚Äôt even know the upper bounds of how fit we can become. ==Mental fitness embraces the idea that individuals can develop a positive mental state that exceeds ‚Äúfine.‚Äù==\n\n\u003e Mental fitness, though, means much more than living without pain or disability. It is about building strength and improving your well-being. Someone who doesn‚Äôt have an ailment may still not be at the level of fitness that they want to be at, and that may impede their goals. Put another way, just because you‚Äôre not ill¬†[doesn‚Äôt mean you can climb Mount Kilimanjaro](https://www.betterup.com/en-us/resources/blog/the-most-valuable-lesson-i-learned-climbing-mount-kilimanjaro?hsLang=en).\n\n\u003e Changing our focus from mental health to mental fitness means asking people about what ‚Äî and how ‚Äî they want to be. What are you training your mind for ‚Äî that is, what is your mountain?¬†[The conversation starts with a new definition of mental health](https://www.betterup.com/en-us/resources/blog/why-mental-fitness-is-of-strategic-importance?hsLang=en)¬†that embraces the idea that people can be more or less mentally fit. Everyone‚Äôs needs and journey to mental strength and fitness is unique. But with support, everyone can be the best, healthiest version of themselves.\n\n\u003e Our brains carry thoughts along neural pathways. These pathways are like ruts that we create and reinforce over time. You can think of these as your brain‚Äôs ‚Äúhabits.‚Äù When we repeat a thought pattern many times, that neural pathway gets reinforced. This makes it more likely that you will repeat the pattern in the future.\n\u003e Sometimes, these thought patterns can make us react in ways that aren't helpful. Instead of reacting to the current situation, we take well-worn pathways to past behaviors. It‚Äôs as if you were taking your usual route to work, taking the same exit on autopilot ‚Äî even when you meant to stop somewhere else.\n\u003e As you build mental fitness, you'll have the awareness, strength, and agility to identify options. You can choose another route instead of responding automatically. Improving your mental fitness is good for your brain‚Äôs¬†[neuroplasticity, which benefits our emotions and memory](https://www.betterup.com/en-us/resources/learning-to-doing-to-being?hsLang=en).\n\u003e Automatic thinking comes from our survival brain, the limbic system. It is constantly scanning the environment for threats and has been throughout evolution. We inherited the limbic system from chimps and it can protect us. But, left unchecked, it can give rise to thoughts and actions that don‚Äôt align with our values and our goals.\n\u003e The good news is that we can reprogram our brains. With the same kind of practice that we use to build muscle, we can create neural pathways that better serve us.\n\n**Emotional push-ups**\n\n\u003e One possible solution, says clinical psychologist¬†[Emily Anhalt](https://www.dremilyanhalt.com/), is to add an ‚Äúemotional workout‚Äù to your self-care regimen. ‚ÄúJust like working out prevents high blood pressure and heart disease, emotional fitness can be a proactive stance toward stress management,‚Äù says Anhalt, the co-founder of¬†[Coa,](https://www.joincoa.com/)¬†a gym for mental health.\n\u003e In Coa‚Äôs virtual classes, Anhalt and her team teach exercises called ‚Äúemotional push-ups,‚Äù which are small ways to work on yourself each day. ‚ÄúThe purpose is to strengthen your mental health muscles so that you‚Äôre in a better position to face life‚Äôs challenges,‚Äù she says.\n\n\u003e Being interviewed recently, Dr Anhalt defined Emotional Fitness as ‚Äòthe ongoing proactive practice of strengthening your mental and emotional health, helping build the tools we need to face and move through the inevitable ups and downs of life‚Äô. The ambition cited was ‚Äòto make working on your mental health as accessible and proactive a practice as working on your physical fitness‚Äô and one example used was that of ‚Äòemotional push-ups‚Äô\n\u003e _A regular push up is a small physical exertion that puts you a little bit outside of your comfort zone - it helps you grow and when you do them often not only will you be able to do more push-ups you‚Äôll also be able to do more of other things, as well as preventing (physical) issues down the line. The emotional equivalent is ==putting ourselves a little bit outside of our emotional comfort zone so that we can grow and do more emotional work and also prevent mental health issues later.==\n\u003e _\n\nThree tips:\n- Build resilience with a self-esteem file\n- Increase productivity by scheduling a worry hour\n\u003e These include striking up conversations with strangers, saying thank you, or accepting compliments without deflection.\n\n**Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria**\n\u003e Instead of relying on avoidance or the negative expectancy that fuels¬†[anxiety](https://www.additudemag.com/slideshows/do-i-have-anxiety-treatment-types/), understand that your responses to rejection follow a pattern. Your goal is to create new patterns of responding, thinking and behaving to reduce both the perceptions of rejection and the reactions when it actually occurs.\n\n##### Outline\n###### Draft 1\n1.

Instead of trying to avoid rejection (which is impossible), become capable enough to face it head-on\n\t2. Aspire not just to be emotionally fine, but to be emotionally fit\n\n##### Draft/Final\n###### ChatGPT template\nRejection is a difficult emotion to grapple with, but it is something that we all face at one point or another in our lives. From job rejections to romantic breakups, the sting of being rejected can leave us feeling helpless and unsure of ourselves. However, with a bit of work and dedication, it is possible to become more resilient against rejection and build up your emotional fitness.\n\nEmotional fitness refers to a person's ability to manage and regulate their emotions in a healthy and constructive way. It involves developing skills such as self-awareness, mindfulness, and resilience, which can help us deal with the ups and downs of life. Emotional fitness is important because it allows us to be more in control of our emotions, and not be overwhelmed by them.\n\nSo, how does emotional fitness work? It involves actively working on our emotional health, just as we would work on our physical health. One way to do this is through what I call \"emotional push-ups\". Just as physical push-ups help to build strength and endurance, emotional push-ups help to build emotional strength and endurance. This involves intentionally practicing skills that will help you become more emotionally fit.\n\nHere are some strategies that you can use to help develop self-awareness, mindfulness, and resilience:\n\nSelf-awareness: One way to develop self-awareness is through self-reflection. This can be done through journaling, which allows you to examine your thoughts and feelings in a structured way. Another way to develop self-awareness is by relying on external support, such as family, friends, counselors, or therapists, who can provide you with feedback and insights about your emotional state.\n\nMindfulness: One way to develop mindfulness is by starting a yoga or meditation practice. These practices help you to become more aware of your thoughts and feelings, and to cultivate a sense of calm and clarity. Another way to develop mindfulness is by writing a gratitude list daily. This helps to shift your focus away from negative thoughts and toward positive aspects of your life.\n\nResilience: One way to develop resilience is by creating a file of your past successes and praises, which you can refer to during tough times. This helps to remind you of your strengths and capabilities, and can give you a boost of confidence when you need it most. Another way to develop resilience is by talking back to your harsh inner critic. This involves challenging negative self-talk and replacing it with more positive and affirming thoughts.\n\nIn summary, the key to becoming resilient against rejection is to actively work on your emotional fitness. Instead of trying to avoid rejection (which is impossible), become capable enough to face it head-on. Aspire not just to be emotionally fine, but to be emotionally fit. By practicing emotional push-ups and developing skills such as self-awareness, mindfulness, and resilience, you can become more in control of your emotions and better equipped to deal with life's challenges.\n\n###### Writing\nRejection is an ineradicable part of our lives. While it is already a difficult emotion to grapple with, some struggle with it more than others ‚Äî particularly those with Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder (ADHD). One of the most understated symptoms of ADHD is emotional dysregulation, which can manifest as rejection sensitive dysphoria (RSD): extreme emotional sensitivity and pain triggered by perceived or actual rejection, teasing, or criticism (Dodson, 2022 \u0026 2023).  What distinguishes RSD from normal emotional responses is this unbearable intensity; it is often experienced as a \"physical\" wound, making the afflicted feel like they were stabbed in the chest. When internalized, RSD leads people to subject themself to negative thought spirals; when externalized, it causes people to explode at  whatever is responsible for their pain. To avoid this unpleasant emotional response, people cope in a variety of unhealthy ways: people-pleasing, giving up on trying, and overachieving. While these defense mechanisms can initially help with relieving internal stress, sole reliance on them prevents people from feeling their emotions, hindering their ability to process them. This enables the fear of rejection to overwhelm their minds, preventing people from making the most out of their lives. \n\nThey key to overcoming RSD is growing thick skin; this can be developed by maintaining emotional fitness: \"an ongoing, proactive practice that increases self-awareness, positively affects relationships...and prevents mental and emotional health struggles down the line\" (Anhalt, n.d.). Ryan Howes, Ph.D (n.d.), defines thick skin is ‚Äúthe ability to adapt and roll with changes and challenges common to life, as well as the ability to bounce back from particularly difficult times.‚Äù; consequently, those who have thin skin (whether it's because of trauma or growing up sheltered) will end up experiencing all of life's hazards with excruciating precision. Thus, emotional fitness is important because it serves as preventative care. Instead of getting stuck in the endless cycle of reacting to and healing from emotional pain, the emotionally fit have the strength to take on life's challenges, making them less vulnerable to getting hurt by them.\n\nWhat makes emotional fitness possible is neuroplasticity: the brain‚Äôs ability to change in response to new experiences and information. It does this by carrying thoughts along neural pathways, which are created and reinforced over time. These pathways act as habits; frequently occuring thought patterns reinforce the involved neural pathway, which in turns increases the likelihood of repeating that pattern (Cooks-Campbell, 2021).  The brain's neuroplasticity can work can work for us or against us. Traumatic experiences like rejection can make the brain develop and default to maladaptive pathways like rumination; conversely, the brain can also rewire itself to overcome such traumatic experiences (Schweig, 2022). \n\nBetter neural pathways can be built through \"emotional push-ups\": small  emotional exertions that puts one a little bit outside of their emotional comfort zone (Anhalt, 2022). The more push-ups one does, the more they grow outside of their comfort zone; this allows  them to do heavier emotional work (e.g. processing rejection) and protect them from mental health issues in the future. Listed below is a list of exercises you can do to develop self-awareness, practice mindfulness, and build resilience (Anhalt, n.d.):\n\n1. **Reflect on yourself through journalling.**\n\t1. If your mind often gets too loud, journalling can help clear out your brain. When you're unloading all your problems and worries onto the page, you're able to slow down and work through your thoughts and feelings.\n\t3. Looking back on previous entries can help you notice thought patterns in your life. After this, you can determine what's keeping you in those patterns. Then, you can break these loops by coming up with solutions.\n\t4. attitude of gratitude... deemphasize negative thoughts\n2. **Take up a yoga or meditation practice.** \n\t1. Through guided breathing and held poses, both yoga and meditation require getting comfortable with the uncomfortable ‚Äî  which is what mindfulness is all about.\n\t2. A greater understanding of your relationship with discomfort gives you more power to change your reaction towards it.\n\t3. So instead of automatically moving away from discomfort, try to sit with it for a while and show yourself that you can handle it. Silence doesn't always have to be broken; issues don't always have to be fixed immediately; difficult conversations don't always have to be avoided.\n\t4. Remember: You do not need to break every silence, fix every issue immediately or avoid difficult conversations.\n3. **Shut down your harsh inner critic.**\n\t1. You can support this healthy self by reminding yourself of your past wins, along with listening to positive affirmations.\n\n\nOverall, instead of trying to avoid rejection (a futile task), become thick-skinned enough to tackle it. This capacity can be built through doing small exercises that challenge you emotionally; over time, these will turn into habits that help you adapt to difficult times. The main lesson you should take away from this column: never stop growing. Continue doing the recommended exercises even if you feel \"fine\", because why settle for fine when you can be thriving (Eatough, 2021)? Emotional fitness is all about constantly striving to be the best version of ourselves; so aspire to be not just emotionally fine, but also emotionally fit.\n\n\n\nMaintaining emotional fitness helps you not only reframe your approach to rejection, but also advocate for a better perception of emotional health. \nIn order to address an emotional problem like RSD, it must first be understood.\nGood emotional health isn't just determined by a lack of pain; one could still be emotionally sensitive or thinking unhealthily. \n\n###### Sources \n- ADHD, RSD\n\t- https://www.additudemag.com/rejection-sensitive-dysphoria-and-adhd/\n\t- https://www.additudemag.com/rejection-sensitive-dysphoria-adhd-emotional-dysregulation/\n- https://psychcentral.com/blog/5-tips-to-develop-thicker-skin#1\n- https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/7-habits-developing-emotional-fitness-mark-conlan/?trk=pulse-article_more-articles_related-content-card\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.731605397Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2023-02-19":{"title":"2023-02-19","content":"## Contemporary Issues: Psychology and Personal Growth\n#psychology #personaldevelopment #sociology #business \n### Module 3.1: Social Capital as Brokerage and Closure\n#### Lecture\n**[Brokerage and Culture: The Importance of Social Capital](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMEz_Ou88Oo)**\n- [[Social capital]] really is about the ==connections== that you make with other people and how that ==benefits== you\n\t- Thinking of it like capital...look at your relationships as personal ==investments==\n- Self-help isn't just about the self. It's about the relationships that we have , and how these relationships benefit us. That is [[Social capital]]\n- What do you get from your social networks?\n\t- You may say support, love, affection\n\t- But more importantly, we also get ==opportunities== and ==information==\n\n##### Brokerage\n- **Brokers:** people who are part of at least two distinct networks, connecting people from these to each other\n\t- Similar to real estate\n- A network indicates the distribution of information, which we define as an advantage: if you have more information, you are at a better position.\n\t- ![[Extras/Media/Images/Social Capital Expansion.png]]\n\t- **Closed networks:** consisted of people who all know each other well \n\t\t- When you're part of a closed network, it means that ==you're working off the same information.== You don't have an advantage for having any more information because the information that you get is similar to what everyone already knows.\n\t- But if you try to be a broker, making a deliberate effort to be a connective tissue across different networks...\n\t\t- You get a new network while still keeping your original network\n\t\t- You have information breadth, timing\n\t\t- You arbritage. You're brokering, bringing together, innovating\n\t- Similar to the concept of [[Weak ties]]?\n- [[Create value by bridging structural holes]]. Here are some specific terms and their definitions:\n\t- **Sticky information:** information expensive to move because: (a) tacit, (b) complex, (c) requires other knowledge to absorb, or (d) interaction with sender, recepient, or channel\n\t- **Structural hole:** disconnection between two groups/clusters of people\n\t- **Bridge:** relation across structural hole\n\t- **Network entrepreneur:** a person who bridges across a structural hole. Also known as \"broker\" or \"connector\" \n\t- **[[Brokerage]]:** act of coordinating across a structural hole\n- [[Business success decreases as the network around a person closes]]\n\t- ![[Extras/Media/Images/Business Network Constraints.png]]\n\t- Those who connect many structural holes, they have a higher performance. Those who have fewer structural holes, those who are more in close networks, their relative performance is actually less.\n- Takeaway: be part of different groups, so that you can get different information. Then, use this information to innovate, to create new ideas.\n\t- You don't have to disperse yourself too much. Just be open to different connections.\n\t- But remember that it's also important to settle in a group, to have your own expertise\n- How [[Brokerage]] works: ===Creativity and innovation=== are at the heart of it\n\t- ![[Extras/Media/Images/Brokerage, Creativity, and Innovation.png]]\n\t- If you're brokering relationships, you get to see alternative perspectives. You get to see best practices, and adapt them to your own contexts.\n- Summary points\n\t- **[[Network structure is a proxy for the distribution of information]]**\n\t\t- For reasons of opportunity, shared interests, experience ‚Äî simple inertia ‚Äî organizations and markets drift towards the bridge-and-cluster structure known as a ==\"small world\"==\n\t- Rules of [[Social capital]]:\n\t\t- **[[Brokers do better]]**\n\t\t\t- Bridge relations across the structural holes between clusters provide information breadth, timing, and arbritage advantages, such that network brokers managing the bridges are at higher risk of \"productive accident\" in detecting and developing good ideas.\n\t\t\t- By clearing the sticky-information market across organizations, brokers tend to be recognized leaders. They are better compensated, more widely celebrated, and more quickly promoted than their peers. Some specifics:\n\t\t\t\t- Close networks do not identify unintelligent managers so much as expert specialists.\n\t\t\t\t- Creativity \u0026 innovation is an ==import/export process.== Value is not at the innovation source. It emerges each time productive new knowledge is adopted in a target audience.\n\t\t\t\t- Creativity \u0026 innovation depend on the network as well as the inventive person. It does not depend on individual genius so much as it depends on employees finding opportunities to broker knowledge from where it is routine to where it would create value.\n\t\t- **[[Contingent returns to brokerage]]**\n\t\t\t- To the extent that the broker is creating something new, there is no guarantee that the proposal will work in our market, with our company processes, staffed by our people. There is risk to accepting the proposal. \n\t\t\t- Chains of command broken in service of company interests can just as easily be broken in service of personal interests, or in service of well-intentioned but strategy-eroding interests. \n\t\t\t- Social standing in the form of job rank, network status, or reputation is the way would-be brokers overcome the suspicions with which brokers can be viewed. \n\t\t\t- Reputation is particularly valuable. It legitimates the largest number of people to be successful brokers.\n\n##### Closure\n- **[[Closed networks facilitate trust and shared beliefs by creating and maintaining reputations]]**\n\t- ![[Extras/Media/Images/Closed networks and reputations.png]]\n- **[[Closure creates \"bandwidth\"]]: more channels of communication allow more accurate and rapid communication, so poor behavior is more readily detected and managed.**\n\t- **[[Closure]]:** the lack of structural holes within a network\n\t- ![[Extras/Media/Images/Closure creates bandwidth.png]]\n\t- Closure can also be very good because it increases your ==trust==\n- **Bottom-line performance advantage of closed networks: [[Reputation mechanism generates trust and efficiency**]]\n\t- By creating a wide bandwidth for information flow, closure enhances communication and personal visibility within a group...\n\t\t- which creates reputation costs for individuals who express opinion or behavior inconsistent with group standards,\n\t\t- which makes in-group behavior less likely, so trust is less risky,\n\t\t- which enhances productivity as people become self-aligning in extraordinary efforts to preserve their reputation (lowering costs for labor, monitoring, quality, and speed)\n\t- Reputation is the mechanism by which [[Closure]] has its effect. [[Closure]] delivers value by creating a reputation cost for deviation from cooperative, extraordinary effort. In other words, ==closure grows the bottom line. == \n\t- Closure is often associated with successful efficiency programs (e.g. SixSigma)\n- Closure is essential to reputation. Positive and negative reputations quickly stabilize. What implications does this have for building reputation?\n- Summary points\n\t- Rule of [[Social capital]]: **Reputations emerge from gossip in close networks, which generates a sense of community and efficiency as a by-product**.\n\t\t- Network closure enhances communication and visibility within a group,\n\t\t\t- (a) which creates reputation costs for individuals who express opinion or behavior inconsistent with group standards, \n\t\t\t- (b) which increases the probability of trust and cooperation within the group, \n\t\t\t- (c) which enhances productivity as people become self-aligning in extraordinary efforts.\n\t\t- Higher productivity comes from lower costs for labor, management, and time. Closure delivers value by creating a reputation cost for deviation from shared colleague opinion and practice. \n\t- CAUTION: **The reputation mechanism by which closure delivers value can have a side-effect of groupthink, a passive \"waiting for orders\", and so value destruction**.\n\t\t- When information moves unaffected through a network (e.g. eBay), closure creates wide bandwidth, facilitating trust and efficiency.\n\t\t- However, social networks usually involve an ==etiquette filter.== The more polite the people, the more etiquette affects what is shared, so ==closure produces echo, not bandwidth.==\n\t\t- The information that defines reputation is selected for empathy between gossipers, not accuracy about the person/object being discussed. The result is ==ignorant certainty== and you no longer own your reputation -- your reputation is owned by the people who gossip about you.\n\t\t- Therefore, there are three key players in reputation development: you, your contact, and the contact's colleague.\n\t\t- Build by focusing on projects colleagues will want to discuss. Allowed to develop unchecked, the ignorant certainty fostered by closed-network echo can become rigid stereotypes about people and practices outside the group (with predictable problems for the realized value of diversity), and people withdraw into Milgram's agentic state, waiting for orders.\n- Overall, you need both [[Brokerage]] and [[Closure]]\n\t- ![[Extras/Media/Images/Advantage and Pathology in the Enterprise Network.png]]\n#### Reading\n\n#### Strength of Weak Ties\n**[Social Networks and Getting a Job: Mark Granovetter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3bBajcR5fE)**\n\n\n\n#### Social Map\n##### Instructions\nNow that you know the importance of social capital--that is, your social connections, networks, and your strong and weak ties--**create a sociogram or social map.**¬†\n-   You can draw your social map of strong and weak ties (have at least 20 connections there).\n    -   Take a photo of it, put it in a document.\n    -   In the same document, answer these questions in a paragraph form:\n        -   Am I a broker or am I part of a closed network?¬†\n        -   How many \"groups\" or \"clusters\" of people do I broker?\n        -   What have been the benefits of belonging to different clusters? What have been the benefits of having a closed network?\n        -   What can I do to achieve an optimal social network?\n    -   Submit a¬†**PDF**¬†document.\n\n##### Answer\nI primarily see myself as a broker. Being a polymath, my various interests have led me to broker multiple groups of people; this can be best seen in how I am part of both dance and tech communities. Belonging to different clusters makes me a T-shaped person: someone who is both a generalist and a specialist, making them highly valuable. For instance, the mindfulness I acquired as a dancer helps me create user-friendly designs, and the computational thinking I learned in computer science helps me in self-studying certain skills/moves; overall, my unique experience in both dance and tech gives me a deep understanding of human cognition. I also acknowledge that having a closed network allows me to grow my reputation. I have been able to witness this by being part of Ateneo's orgs for dance and human-centered design, both of which are known for being excellent in their respective crafts. Interacting constantly with both current members and alumni of these organizations provided me opportunities for my personal development (e.g. internships, freelance projects, gigs). Overall, I believe that achieving an optimal social network requires a keen eye for structural holes, whether it's between or within clusters.  Knowing what is needed will help you not only create new connections, but also nurture your existing relationships.","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.731605397Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2023-02-20":{"title":"2023-02-20","content":"## Historical and Philosophical Foundations of Education\n#EDUC101i #education #history #philosophy \n**Focus: Medieval Education**\n### The knight and the craftsman\nIn part 1, religion was the main influencer of the educational era, while here in this second part two new themes emerge: ==Society and Economy.== To what extent does society and economy shape the perception of the educated person? This is the key question that will drive our discourse.\n### The knight in shining armor\n- This 3rd character in the medieval era is the knight. With the many hollywood blockbusters and Netflix series that have been created about Kings, queens, knights, warlocks and the like, many visuals probably easily come to mind...but what was the backdrop of these fairytale-like adventures? The quick answer is: ==the feudal system.== \n- Watch this [short video about feudalism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQq6OeiEfrg) to recall the context of what we will begin to label as Chivalric Education. As you watch the video about the feudal system,  think about these points:\n1. What is the essence of the feudal system?\n2. Does this social organization exist in current times?\n\n- In the Feudal System, chivalry brought forth an educational system particularly for the noble class - who, as you learned in the video above, was the lucky minority. -- Chivalric education then, was training for knighthood. The [next video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_N8Nt5q5Go) shows shows the training a squire has to undergo to become a knight.  \n\n- As compared to Monasticism and Scholasticism, Chivalric Education emphasized \"action\" (Remember in Greek Education - where the themes of man of wisdom and man of action first emerged?). \n- However, like in the past 2 types of education, the aim was still quite singular - ==a devotion to the service of the Knight's God - who in this case is his King and Queen.== \n- The aim therefore was mainly \"social discipline\" - in the two videos above, one of the clear descriptors of this age was how people were divided into classes in society - and for a person to live by the expectations of his/her class.\n\n\u003e Who was the educated man in Chivalric Education? How is the education man different/similar here? (vs. conceptions of the educated person influenced by monasticism/scholasticism)\n\n##### The craftsman and the masterpiece\n- In Chivalric Education, securing one's place in society was one of the main purposes of education. The context of which was feudalism and the rule of royalty and the landed. However, in the latter part of the middle ages, the [crusades](https://www.history.com/topics/middle-ages/crusades) happened, and this set up the context for this next form of education. \n- Because of the crusades, there was an increase of trade and commerce across countries, which ushered the growth of free cities (the downfall of feudalism) and the rise of the middle class, or the ==\"burgher\"==\n- Anyway, it was in this context that the Craftsman in the Guild System was developed, in pursuit of the \"masterpiece\".\n- Think about a masterpiece you've made before. What did school or your own education have to do with it? How has your education contributed to your ability to create that masterpiece? or if you think that it wasn't education that led to it, what did?\n- In the guild system, creating a masterpiece is necessary to ==reach the highest level of education.== Guilds are associations of people who share a common interest or do the same kind of work (If being part of a varsity team or an organization led you to a masterpiece, then you might have been part of a \"modern day guild\".  The emergence of the guilds necessitated a new kind of education that focuses on ==vocational training.==\n- Watch this video on [medieval guilds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnQlHeee9Dw).\n  - Overview of the guild system:\n    1. Parent brings a boy to a master\n    2. Parents pay the master to house and feed the boy\n    3. He is taken in as an apprentice\n    4. The young man trains for nine years\n    5. The young man becomes a journeyman\n    6. The young man receives wages\n    7. The guild approves his masterpiece\n    8. The young man opens his own shop  \n\n\u003e Is there something that you think we can take from this education system, that would improve how the current education system is? How so? \n\n### Rethinking the Educated Person\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23095578/220029030-571c5ce1-aaf0-4eb1-a483-fc3cd8bd8f43.png)\nIn this module, you learned about the 4 key characters of Medieval Education (The monk, the scholastic, the knight and the craftsman) - each one representing a particular view about the educated person that consequently shaped the aims, methods and content of education. As we put this module to a close, we go back to the key question we started with: Who is an educated person?\n\n1. To what extent does your conception of the educated person agree with or differ from the 4 perspectives of the educated person in Medieval Education?\n2. In these 4 types of education we explored, we saw how religion, society and economy influenced the type of education presented. Reflect on your conception of an educated person - what do you think has shaped your perspective?\n\n#### Answer\n##### Outline\n- My alignment with the four perspectives\n  -  My conception: an open-minded critical thinker.\n  -  Addition to this: who dedicates themself towards gaining expertise or enlightenement? a lifelong learner. this is the diffrentiator\n  -  Similarities\n    -  Explicit progression\n    -  Intention\n    -  Discipline\n  -  Difference\n    - Aims... less to do with the state or religion  \n- What external forces have shaped your perspective?\n  - values from surrounding environment and religion?\n  - Reading this module made me realize that I am a social being\n  - Before: being an introvert and philomath with ADHD, I used to think that a lot of my education was self-driven. If I had a particular interest (e.g. strength \u0026 conditioning; metacognition), I'd go out of my way to learn it\n  - But I realized that the people surrounding me not only motivate my education, but also facilitate it \n\n##### Writing\n\nFor me, the educated person is an open-minded critical thinker. Aside from this, they must also be a lifelong learner, constantly dedicating themselves to gaining more expertise or enlightenment. Looking at the four key characters of Medieval Education, I can definitely say that there is more agreement than disagreement. This is because of the underlying aim of security, which I believe all the 4 types of education share despite their differences. The monk and the scholastic pursued education in order to secure their faith; the former wanted to shed the unholiness of their predecessors, while the latter wanted to defend their beliefs against unbelievers. Even if the next two types became more secular in nature, this need for security still remained. The knight and the craftsman pursued education in order to secure their place in society; the former did this by working to become a valuable asset for the king/queen, while the latter did this by working to be seen as valuable by their fellow citizens. Overall, this need for security made discipline (whether physical or intellectual) a result of Medieval Education. I believe this trait is stil worth developing today (without the extreme methods employed by Medieval Education).\n\nReflecting on my conception of the educated person, I can definitely see how much my social network has influenced my perspective. Before, I saw my education was mainly self-driven, given that I'm an introvert with ADHD. Whenever I have a new hyperfixation (e.g. strength \u0026 conditioning, metacognition), I'd go out of my way to learn all about it: diving down internet rabbitholes, attending relevant talks and classes, and writing my own notes and essays. However, I realize now that no human is exempt from being a social creature, which has definitely influenced my education; I can't deny that it's people who mainly drive and sustain my learning. Even if I'm inherently passionate about my interests, it's my friends and idols that spark these passions inside of me. Even if I consider myself a philomath (a natural lover of learning), it's my peers and teachers that motivate me to continue learning. As a result, I now liken the educated person to a patchwork quilt; they are a \"masterpiece\" made up of their learning influences.\n\n#### Summary of Module 2\n1. **THE EDUCATED MAN:** One of the main themes we explored in this module is the educated person, and as you saw, there were 4 different perspectives presented. As educators in the future, your own conception of the educated person will affect your views about teaching and learning. At the same time, the institutions you will be teaching in will also have their own perceptions of the educated person - it would be good to see if your paradigm matches with theirs.\n**2. RELIGION, SOCIETY and ECONOMY:** Another set of themes that emerged here were the external influences of education - religion, society and economy. When you think about it, education today is still influenced by these forces. What other forces do you think continues to flavor the aims and type of education? Think about schools like Ateneo - what is the bias of institutions like ours?\n\n \n","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.731605397Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2023-02-21":{"title":"2023-02-21","content":"## Contemporary Issues: Psychology and Personal Growth\n\n#psychology #personaldevelopment \n### Intimacy, Sex, (In)fidelity\n#### Sex, Power, Assault\n- In this sub-module, we will be talking about something \"taboo.\" Nonetheless, it is an important topic: sex.\n- We start with a discussion of the book **Sexual Citizens: A Landmark Study of Sex, Power, and Assault on Campus** by Jennifer Hirsch and Shamus Khan. It's an immensely powerful book that offers counter-intuitive ideas on thinking about assault, sexual \"projects\", sexual locations, and thinking of how sex figures into a good life.\n- The book is almost 400 pages long. Would you want to read the book for three days, or would you want to watch an hour-long video about it? Even if it's still quite long, I think the one hour you spend with this video will be worth it. :)\n\n**[Jennifer S. Hirsch and Shamus Khan | Sexual Citizens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYYWyEqJjlk)**\n\u003e Over five years, professors Jennifer Hirsch and Shamus Khan interviewed more than 150 Columbia and Barnard College undergrads about their sex lives. The research explored what students wanted out of sex, how troubling encounters unfolded and how layers of misunderstandings led to assault. This is the book to read to help lead conversations about sex. It reframes the dialogue and helps prepare young people for sexual relationships. Read it, share it. Empower the young folks in your life.\n- It's not about adjudication; it's about prevention\n- One of the strongest predictors for being assaulted in college was being assaulted in high school\n- One of the reasons why assaults happen: the silence and shame that exists around sex and sexuality\n  - People lose their voice when they find themselves in situations they don't want to be in...rights aren't talked about  \n  - This is why it's important to have parents who talk about sex...it allows their kids to trust them with related topics. Otherwise, their values will be formed by pornography and advertising\n- Beds have meanings...they're laden\n- It's not just furniture that influences campus life, but also control over space -- which is really important for explaining power imbalances.\n- Most girls are conditioned largely by society or their parents to see sex as an ==emotional currency==. Meanwhile, for most boys, it was the opposite; they were conditioned to see sex as a ==physical currency==.\n  - Hybridizing these perspectives would create a healthier viewpoint of sex in general\n- \"You up?\" has a lot of meanings\n- Asking \"Was this consensual or not?\" is really fundamentally a question about ==adjudication==, that is, who can we hold responsible for what happened, and what would a reasonable person do within this kind of context.\n- Alternative viewpoint: seeing consent processes as things that were not just a negotiation between two people in a moment, but instead that had ==entire social worlds== that were brought in that moment\n  - E.G. friends helping each other interpret the aftermath of sex, hooking up friends with other friends\n  - ^ All these relationships influence the sexual experience\n- What we say doesn't always align with what we think, especially in terms of consent\n  - People have consented sex without verbally saying anything, and people who verbally consent participate in sex that they don't desire\n- Push away from the idea of sex as as a contract. Part of the idea of sexual citizenship is asking how you're treating the other person.\n  - Are you treating them like someone who said yes, or treating them like a human being who was forced to say yes? \n- On people choosing to do sexual acts just to complete the encounter... these are failures of sexual citizenship \n  - Men: not asking what the person really wanted\n  - Women: raised in such a way that they think this is how they should be acting sexually \n- The heterosexual students have a clear script that they learn (from media) for how sex should go forward. Meanwhile, the LGBTQ students don't have this script. Findnigs: there were many queer students whose consent practices were actually exactly the way you would want consent to be like.\n  - On the one hand, queer consent practices seemed like they should be producing a lot of safety. But on the other hand, we know from our survey and from other surveys that their rates of assault are actually much higher.\n  - Perhaps because there is already so much shame surrounding gender identity. The kind of fear about the character of queer communities often produced additional warned of vulnerabilities for young people.\n- On the influence of alcohol: students don't just drink and then like mistakenly have sex. In fact, they do it on purpose -- they drink in order to have sex.\n- Race: you can't look atthe moment of consent without understanding sort of the broader dynamics of campus social life\n- Vision: prevention of sexual assault. Mission: breaking the silence on sex. How? Comprehensive sexuality education that is not just a course that's taught in school, but instead a kind of ==national project== that everyone participates in.\n  - Analogy: driving. We don't just give people the keys (which is what sex education is like, heavily focused on the body). Instead, we tell them how to drive safely. We also create environments (i.e. roads) and policies to make driving safer. \n  - Part of the prevention strategy is to ask ourselves like what would it look like to do sexuality education in the same way that we do driver's ed\n- A strategy against adjucation: a restorative justice model. Part of the ways in which we should think about adressing assaults after they happen is in reaffirming people's sexual citizenship\n  - There is a normative commitment (not just carceral)\n- Pornography  has such a large influence on young people because we've abdicated our responsibility to actually provide sexuality education in it.\n- Part of the idea here in in placing sex within a broader matrix of social relationships so in saying that like sex is a social behavior it's not a health behavior is that is to say that like there are lots of things that we can do in terms ofcreating the conditions of basic respectand recognition of other persons that have nothing to do with sex that could actually have big impacts on the ways in which people act sexually\n- Analytical tools (three main concepts):\n  - What is your sexual project?\n  - How can we build sexual citizenship?\n  - What are the power inequalities within space? (sexual geography)\n- making that learning (about sex) about critical thinking and power... is part of providing them with the ==tools== that they need to ==navigate these social worlds== more safely\n\n##### Reflection about Sex\n\u003e Without needing to go deep into your personal lives, what are your reflections about how these ideas might be relevant to your life? What is sex for you? What are your thoughts about hooking up? How do your friends talk about sex? What have you learned about sex? Where do you learn about sex?\n\nListening to the *Sexual Citizens* discussion made me realize how lucky I am to have my current group of friends. My *barkada* has been together since senior high school, where we were all brought together through *Dungeons \u0026 Dragons* ‚Äî a game that has kept us close-knit for so long. Because of this, we've witnessed each other's development over the years (e.g. discovering gender and sexuality, getting into new relationships, exploring ways of expressing sexuality). I would consider my friends my main source of learning about sex.\n\nOne thing I learned from them is that intimacy can be platonic too. My friend group is mainly composed of guys (9 of them versus 4 girls), and they are so...affectionate, even if most of them are straight. They hug each other, tell each other \"I love you (man)\", and give each other gifts (even if they can get *gago* at times; recently, one of my guy friends brought back condoms from Italy). Whenever the group has sleepovers, the guys aren't afraid to sleep close to each other. It's quite heartwarming to see. Even the girls in the group could experience this. For instance: people would often assume I was dating two of my guy best friends because of how intimate they would act towards me (e.g. hugs, leaning towards each other, holding hands); in reality, this was just their way of expressing affection. My friend group also engages in intimacy by sharing our pains together: problematic parents, financial struggles, suicide attempts, etc. Whenever one of us was going through something, the others would definitely show our support as soon as we could, dropping everything to be virtually/physically present with the person.\n\nAnother thing I learned from my friends is that I have the right to speak up for myself. The way I grew up conditioned me to become a people-pleaser, even if I wasn't comfortable/happy with the situation I was in. To counter this, my two best guy friends would constantly remind me of my right. They'd tell me that I could say no anytime, which taught me to keep in touch with my feelings. One other way I learned to stand up for myself was when a sex scandal exploded in our high school, triggering tons of girls to come out with their own stories. At the time, the guys in the friend group had a tendency of making misogyntistic jokes, which left the girls feeling uncomfortable. The scandal motivated us girls to speak up about this with our guy friends. They listened well, validated our feelings, and apologized, which completely touched us. Even if my friend group isn't perfect, I am grateful to have a safe space where I can grow with them.\n\n#### Rethinking (In)Fidelity\nWhat do we really mean by infidelity? Is infidelity the end of a relationship or the beginning of a new one? How do we rethink it? In this TED Talk by Esther Perel, she highlights new ways of understanding such a phenomenon.\n\n**[Esther Perel: Rethinking infidelity....a talk for anyone who ever loved](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpp1nlx2aPM)**\n- Questions\n\t- Why do we cheat, and why do happy people cheat?\n\t- How do we see/define infidelity?\n\t- Why do we think that men cheat out of boredom and fear of intimacy but women cheat out of loneliness and hunger for intimacy?\n\t- Is an affair always the end of a relationship?\n- Infidelity has a tenacity that marriage can only envy\n- How do we reconcile what is universally forbidden yet universally practiced?\n- Tribe history\n\t- Men had a license to cheat, with practically little consequence\n\t- Supported by a host of biological and evolutionary theories that justified their need to roam\n- Monogamy used to be one person for life. Today, monogamy is one person at a time.\n- Monogamy had nothing to do with love.\n\t- men relied on women's fidelity in order to know whose children these are and who gets the cows when I die\n- The definition of infidelity keeps on expanding.\n\t- E.G. sexting, watching porn, staying secretly active on dating apps \n\t- Because there is no universally agreed-upon definition of what even constitutes an infidelity\n- Definition of an affair through three key elements:\n\t- a secretive relationship (core structure of an affair) \n\t- an emotional connection to one degree or another \n\t- a sexual alchemy\n- Marcel Proust: \"It's our imagination that is responsible for love, not the other person\"\n- When marriage was an economic enterprise, infidelity threatened our economic security. But now that marriage is a romantic arrangement, infidelity threatens our ==emotional security.==\n- Ironically, we used to turn to adultery -- that was the space where we sought pure love. But now that we seek love in marriage, adultery destroys it.\n- Three ways infidelity hurts different today:\n\t- We have a romantic ideal in which we turn to one person to fulfill an endless list of needs (e.g. greatest lover, best friend, best parent, trusted confidant, etc.). \n\t\t- This tell us we're chosen, indispensable, irreplaceable, etc. And infidelity tells us that we're not. It is the ultimate betrayal.\n\t- In the past, infidelity has always been painful. Now, it is also traumatic because it threatens our ==sense of self==.\n\t\t- Infidelity is a violation of trust, a crisis of identity\n\t\t- Affairs in the digital age: death by a thousand cuts\n\t- We are relying on our partners fidelity in with a unique fervor, but we also have never been more inclined to stray.\n\t\t- And not because we have new desires today, but because we live in an era where we feel that we are entitled to pursue our desires (i.e. \"I deserve to be happy\")\n\t\t- If we used to divorce because we were unhappy, today we divorce because we could be happier. And if divorce carried all the shame, today choosing to stay when you can leave is the new shame\n- So if we can divorce, why do we still have affairs? Now the typical assumption is that if someone cheats, it's either there's something wrong in your relationship or wrong with you.\n\t- But millions of people can't all be pathological. Logic: if you have everything you need at home, why go out? If you have a perfect marriage, why cheat?\n\t- But what if passion is a finite shelf life? What if there are things that even a good relationship can never provide?\n- Most cheaters are not chronic philanders. They are people who are conflicted between their values and behavior.\n- Affairs are an act of betrayal, and they are also an expression of ==longing and loss==. \n\t- At the heart of an affair, you will often find a longing and a yearning for an emotional connection, for novelty, for freedom, for autonomy, for sexual intensity, a wish to recapture lost parts of ourselves, or an attempt to bring back vitality in the face of loss and tragedy.\n\t- One word to describe affairs: they feel alive\n- Affairs are way less about sex and a lot more about ==desire. ==\n\t- Desire for attention, desire to feel special, desire to feel important\n\t- The very structure of an affair -- the fact that you can never have your lover -- keeps you wanting: that in itself is a desire machine.\n- Affairs, when exposed, may make way for a whole new kind of truth.\n\t- E.G. honest and open conversations, rekindled sexual desire\n- So when affairs are exposed, what can couples do?\n\t- We know from trauma that ==healing begins== when the perpetrator ==acknowledges their wrongdoing.==\n\t- It is essential to do things that bring back a sense of self-worth (through being surrounded by friends and keeping busy with activities). \n\t- But even more important is to curb the curiosity to mine for the sordid details. Instead switch to the investigative questions, the ones that mine ==the meaning and the motives.==\n\t\t- E.G. \"What did this affair mean to you?\"; \"What were you able to express or experience there that you could no longer do with me?\" ETC.\n- Betrayal in a relationship comes in many forms. There are many ways that we betray our partner: with contempt, with neglect, with indifference, with violence. Sexual betrayal is only one way to hurt a partner. \n\t- In other words, the victim of an affair is not always the victim of the marriage.\n- Takeaway: look at affairs from a dual perspective. Hurt and betrayal on one side, growth and self-discovery on the other. What it did to you, and what it meant for me.\n\n#### Integrating Ideas\nHere are some key integrating ideas and reflection questions:\n-  **Sexual citizenship**¬†is not about being \"liberated\" but ==respecting people's rights to their sexual lives.== In the same way that citizenship affords you rights and responsibilities, being sexual citizens provides you with similar rights and responsibilities. People have sex for different reasons, and you have to think about what reasons you have for it.\n-   Discussion on¬†**sex and sexuality**¬†is usually shrouded with a lot of¬†**shame and silence**. What are things that we need to talk about? What are things that need to be discussed more? Masturbation? Non-marital sex? Hooking up? LGBTQ issues? Open relationships? Dating apps? Kinks? BDSM?\n-   Often, we talk about¬†**sexual intimacy¬†and¬†long-term relationships**¬†together with each other. But what happens when these relationships break down because of issues of trust? As we've seen, ==an infidelity challenges our sense of self, identity, and emotional security.== It's not so much the sex as it is the betrayal of trust--the realization that we were insufficient. But is an infidelity always the end of a relationship, or could it be the start of a new one?\n-   **Intimacy can come in different forms**. Not everything is about sex. Intimacy can come in friendship--in a sharing of life's hurts, pains, pleasures, and joys. How are you living out this intimacy?\n\nBelow, please share about what¬†**ideas you want to talk more about**¬†and what¬†**insights were inspired in you**¬†after the videos you've just watched.\n\n##### Answer\n**Questions to take on:**\n- shame and silence\n- intimacy can come in different forms\n\nGiven that discussion on sex and sexuality is usually shrouded with shame and silence, one thing that I believe needs to be talked about more is **asexuality**. What most people don't know is that asexuality is an umbrella term, and it exists on a spectrum. This can lead to many misconceptions surrounding asexuality. For instance, asexuals aren't always sex-repulsed; there are also asexuals who are sex-neutral or sex-positive. And desiring libido or intimacy (whether romantic or platonic) does not disqualify one from asexuality. These misconceptions can lead to many people being confused about their sexuality; I am one such example.\n\nIt was in college when I realized that I may belong in the asexual spectrum. The feeling of sexual attraction was odd and unfamiliar to me (I never had celebrity or fictional crushes), so online dating and one-night stands ‚Äî concepts heavily dependent on physical appearance ‚Äî weirded me out. The only time I experienced this kind of attraction was when I was dating my best friend back in high school. So when I came across demisexuality, an orientation that requires close emotional connection for sexual attraction, it resonated a lot with me. However, it took me a long time to come to terms with this because of numerous doubts caused by misconceptions. Isn't this experience normal? Do I still qualify if I've experienced masturbation and/or sex, and am still open it? How come I can't relate to other aces? I was only able to quell these doubts by researching a lot online, along with confiding with other friends (who were also going through similar struggles). These processes helped me because I realized I wasn't alone in my struggle; if sex and sexuality wasn't such a taboo topic, others like me would definitely get the help they'd need.\n\nCurrently, I'm choosing to stay single (even if I desire a romantic relationship, it's not something I'm fully open to yet). While this can feel lonely at times (especially when most of your friends are happily taken), I've been fulfilling my need for intimacy in other ways: warm hugs, deep conversations, and self-care.  Having a more inclusive definition of intimacy has helped me acknowledge my emotions instead of repressing them (thanks to years of conditioning from being immersed in the conservative culture of Filipino families and Catholic schools). I wish others would be able to experience a similar level of emotional security.\n\n![[Extras/Media/Images/Asexuality.png]]\n\n#### Podcast\n\n\u003e The podcast is a¬†**10‚Äì15-minute conversation with a person**¬†that the student chooses, trying to integrate the content of the discussion to the topic in class about relationships, social networks, and/or intimacy.\n\u003e It can be with a friend, partner, professor, or loved one‚Äîeither about social capital and how they leveraged it OR ==about their thoughts on intimacy and a mature, loving relationship.==\n\u003e Please write a short reflection/synthesis on how what the person said and what you learned in class are connected.

In your perspective (i.e. Psych background, asexuality), what is your perception of intimacy?\n2. How do you live intimacy in your life, whether romantically or platonically?\n3. Connected to this...what makes a relationship mature and loving?\n4. After fights, how do you rekindle intimacy in your current relationship?\n\n##### Takeaways\nIntimacy is a two way-street; it requires an established set of rules between two people in a relationship, whether it's of a romantic or platonic nature. And just as intimacy can come in many forms (e.g. physical presence, emotional support), so can betrayals in relationships; you can commit infidelity not just sexually, but also emotionally. But fights can also serve as a form of communication, helping people in relationships align and grow together. However, it's important to not let anger take over during a fight; this is because it prevents people from discovering the meaning and motives behind their partner's actions, which is necessary for aligning in relationships.\n","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.731605397Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2023-02-23":{"title":"2023-02-23","content":"## Historical and Philosophical Foundations of Education\n#EDUC101i #education #philosophy #history \n### Critical Reflection Essay 1: Ancient-Medieval Times\n#### Instructions\n1.  **Describe**¬†an issue/trend in Philippine Education that is predominant today (ex. student discipline, participation of women, use of technology in teaching, etc.)¬†Cite relevant sources to explain the issue and to justify its relevance in Philippine Education.¬†You can draw from articles from news outlets/official government documents and/or published academic work from experts/reputable institutions.

What have I learned?\n\n##### Writing\n###### Draft 1\nWe are living in not just the Information Age, but also the Age of  Information Disorder: a time where all kinds of false, misleading, manipluated, or deceptive information thrives (Wardle, ?). While humans have always been capable of deception, this ability has been amplified by the advent of the Internet. This invention was envisioned to be an utopia: a stateless world where abundant ‚Äúfree‚Äù information would equalize social relations and challenge traditional property rights (Cowles, 2009); however, the current state of our cyberspace falls far from this promise. Fake news, conspiracy theories, false claims, and more contaminate our information ecosystem, and this pollution continues to grow thanks to guilty and innocent people alike.  What was designed to connect us is instead dividing us.\n\nThis disorder was further exacerbated by the COVID-19 public health crisis. While the virus was spreading globally, so was false and misleading information, creating an infodemic (World Health Organization, n.d.). State leaders from all over the world then used this as an opportunity to gain control over their countries' digital environments, and this can be visibily seen in Southeast Asia. As a region with a long history of governments weaponizing the law, it is considered not just a hub of bad examples of disinformation regulation, but also a hub of disinformation innovations (Corpus Ong, 2021). Here, we can observe the various ways governments enact censorship: from forcing silence (Singapore's \"anti-fake-news\" law) to encouraging noise (Indonesia's Instagram clickfarm industry). At the center of this crisis is the Philippines, which is considered \"patient zero\" of the global misinformation epidemic (Rappler, 2018). An army of bloggers, digital influencers, and fake account operators brought Rodrigo Duterte the presidency in 2016. In his term, he incorporated these disinformation workers into the government, thus \"institutionalizing\" disinformation at the state level (Gaw interviewed by Tuquero, 2022). This paved the way for Bongbong Marcos' victory in 2022, despite his family's controversial legacy. Philippine politics exhibits the weaponization of social media -- it is useful not just for winning the presidency, but also revising history. \n\nThe success of Marcos and his family was not fuelled by social media platforms alone; the influence they've gained online was nurtured by the Philippine education system. When K-12  was implemented in the country, the Philippine History course was removed from the high school curriculum; government representatives believed that Araling Panlipunan (AP) sufficiently covered local history (Ignacio, 2019). However, the way AP is taught in school has played a big part in rehabilitating the Marcos family's image (Santos, 2022). First: the resources at hand are unreliable. AP textbooks often contain errors and misinformation about Marcos Sr. and Martial Law; these would present the former president as a beloved dictator. The accuracy of these books is vital because most AP teachers are not history majors, and end up heavily relying on these. Next: the discussion and analysis of Martial Law is inadequate in both textbooks and classroom instruction. Because of its placement at the tail end of the curriculum (since history is discussed is chronological order)   and frequent class suspensions, many AP teachers do not cover Martial Law in depth -- or do not discuss it at all. Then: the presentation, emphasis, and interpretation of Martial Law is not thorough enough. For instance: when corruption is brought up, too much focus is often placed on the Marcos cronies, and not the Marcos family themselves. Finally: Martial Law education is processed, evaluated, and appreciated subjectively. AP topics are usually taught by making students look at the \"positive\" and \"negative\" effects, then asking them to come up with their own conclusion; however, many teachers hesitate or refuse to judge Martial Law due to personal bias, fear, or a false notion of objectivity. \n\nNow that Marcos Jr. is president, historical revisionism is fully thriving. Content creators outshine  historical and news organizations whenever \"Marcos history\" is searched on Youtube (Soriano \u0026 Gaw, 2021); DepEd modules are now calling Martial Law a period of \"The New Society\" (Hernando-Malipot, 2022); movies and musicals (i.e. \"Maid in Malaca√±ang\" and \"Here Lies Love\") are portraying the Marcos Family in a positive light. Meanwhile, the red-tagging against independent media still persists: \"anti-government\" books have been pulled out of libraries, bookstores have been vandalized with anti-communist messages, and many journalists have been charged with crimes -- or even worse, killed (Santos, 2022; Demegillo, 2022).  In this post-truth era, Imelda Marcos' words hold true: \"Perception is real, the truth is not\".  A Philippine Education built on perception holds terrifying consequences for our society.  So how can we save our education system from the impacts of information disorder? We can get a lot of inspiration from both the past and present.\n\nOne era we can learn from is Ancient China. Their concept of education was mostly based on Confusianism: a belief system that focuses on the importance of personal ethics and morality; its influence could be seen everywhere in their education system, from the objectives of education to the ways it was taught. Back then, education was aimed to preserve and perpetuate the past: traditional beliefs, customs, and way of life. The Chinese believed this was needed in order to secure social stability. As a result, ideals and beliefs were the same from generation to generation. To support this educational aim, moral training was emphasized. At the time, moral training revolved around the idea of of noble living; this meant valuing the five relationships and following the five cardinal values. Noble living was also incorporated into their education's content: the Four Books and the Five Classics. The former would discuss abstract values (e.g. moral self-cultivation, devotion to learning, inherent goodness), while the latter would show how these principles were applied to real life (e.g. narrative history, ritual conduct, divination). The methods used in teaching also helped further stress the importance of preserving the past and noble living. Students were required to model essays after sacred writing, along with reciting passages from memory. Aside from rote memorization, there was also the Confucian method of teaching, which expected practical application from students; they learned this by being exposed to the world outside of the classroom, along with developing their own reasoning. Based on what can be seen in this era, the Chinese would definitely have no tolerance for the historical revisionism caused by information disorder. Given that their education also aimed to turn students into civil servants, they would be displeased to see government officials who lack a foundation in history and morals. \n\nAnother era we can also learn from is the Medieval Times, particularly  Monasticism and Scholasticism. In response to moral degeneracy, both of these movements anchored the conception of an educated man on religious piety. They then pursued this ideal through the development of purity and intellect; the former aimed for the salvation of individual souls, while the latter aimed to defend faith through reason. Thus, the types and content of education at the time revolved around God and the church. For instance, the Seven Liberal Arts from Monastic education all had religious purposes. Reading was learnt for studying the sacred books; writing for copying manuscripts; singing for participating in religious cermonies; and calculating for computing times of church festivals. Then, when Scholasticism introduced religious philosophy (a new sytem of philosophizing about theological beliefs), students learned not only how to practice their faith, but also how to stand up for it. Scholasticism was able to impact the secular world thanks to Thomas Aquinas, who taught Western Europe that any human could access great truths whenever they utilized reason. It is thanks to him that the world has a philosophical framework for open scientific inquiry, along with the belief that knowledge can and should come from multiple sources. Based on what can be seen in this era, monks and scholars alike would definitely not approve of the creation and dissemination of false, misleading, manipluated, or deceptive information; it is because these acts go against godly principles (i.e. \"Do not bear false witness\") and cannot be defended properly.\n\nIn our present times, when it comes to fighting information disorder, the Philippines can learn a lot from Finland -- Europe's most resistant nation to the post-truth phenomenon (Open Society Institute, 2018). According to Juha Pyykk√∂, Finland's ambassador to the Philippines, the country was successful because of two things: trust and education (PamPastor, 2022). Trust helps because it is an important concept in Finnish culture. Due to this, the media is highly trusted by the Finnish, which in turn make them less likely to turn to alternative news sources. This value also enables a multi-sectoral approach against disinformation; government, business, civil society, academia, etc. get together to design the policies and decide calls to action. Education helps because it equips the Finnish with the tools to deal with disinformation. Multi-platform information literacy and strong critical thinking are a core cross-subject component of the national curriculum; math shows how easy it is to lie with statistics, art displays how an image's meaning can be easily manipluated, history dissects notable propaganda campaigns, and language exhibits the many ways words can be used for deception (Henley, 2020). Irregardless of background, every Finn gets access to this same curriculum, for they believe in comprehensive and equal education. \n\nWhile differing contexts makes it difficult to copy Finland's strategy, Filipinos can rebuild trust and education in their own ways. First, by supporting the media. Working in media is difficult due to its typically low wage and life-endangering nature (for journalists); thus, initiatives such as the International Fund for Public Interest Media and the Freedom Fund for Filipino Journalists are crucial for keeping the field alive. Next, by embracing technology. \"Truth influencers\" have been utilizing social media for themselves in order to fight information disorder. For instance, on Tiktok, academic Francis Gealogo shares history facts, and journalist Lian Buan shares news reports; meanwhile, on Instagram, independent media like Media Commoner disseminate research through digestible carousels. Finally, by pushing for regulation. Third party fact-checkers help keep social media platforms in check; however, these platforms still need to be held accountable for their influence. This is where legislation comes in. But Maria Ressa (2021) believes that this should be the focus of lawmakers, instead of anti-fake news bills (which can be easily abused by the government). Europe's Digital Services Act Package, which aims to create a safer digital environment, could be a great model for this.\n\n###### Draft 2\n\n- How Historical eras tackle information disorder \n\t- their aims \n\t\t- China: preserving the past, noble living\n\t\t- Europe: salvation of souls, defending faith through reason\n\t- their content and methods\n\t\t- they had figures/influencers as role models: Confucius and Saint Thomas Aquinas... embodiments of these aims\n\t\t- their education reflected these values, so that they wouldn't be forgotten\n\t\t- reliant on memory: memorization, exact imitation (give both examples of China and Europe)\n\t\t- practical application: Confucian method, debate...framework for open scientific inquiry\n\t\t\t- both show the belief that knowledge can come from multiple sources\n\n\n- Comparison paragraph\n\t- Identify similarities/differences between the past and the present\n\t\t- similarities\n\t\t\t- aims: we too are driven by belief systems\n\t\t- differences\n\t\t\t- rote memorization is not as important as before\n\t- Compare/ Contrast the contexts and factors that affected the issue/trend in the past and the present.\n\t\t- geography \n\t\t\t- The geographic features of China isolated it from other regions.

Try to take note of 2-3 things - it can be in terms of the subject of the art, the style? the color? etc.¬† \n\n#### The two faces of humanism\n- To give you a head start, here's a brief overview to set-up the context of the Renaissance Movement.\n- **[What Was the Renaissance? AP Euro Bit by Bit #1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txKiku3qJN4)**\n\t- Renaissance means ==rebirth== and that's how intellectuals saw the time they were living in\n\t- Renaissance thinkers viewed the Middle Ages as a vast chasm that ==divided== them from the ==glory of the ancient world==\n\t- The Renaissance focused on a new appreciation of the ==abilities of the individual==, and along the way, this new focus created what we now recognize is the ==modern world==\n- The early renaissance in Italy put much premium on ==personal culture, individual freedom, and development to attain a full life.== Hence, it was referred to as¬†**[[Individual humanism]].**¬† \n- The renaissance movement¬† that later on spread in northern Europe stressed social and moral reform as instrumental to achieving a meaningful life.¬† It was know as¬†**[[Social humanism]].**¬†\n- These two \"types\" of renaissance gave rise two educational systems.¬†Read this excerpt¬†to learn about the distinct features of these educational systems.\n\n##### Discussion Board\nIn the discussion forum below, share:\n1. **3 ideas**¬†that caught your attention about individual or social humanism (label for alignment. Ex. Idea 1(individual).¬†\n2.¬†**2 \"quotable quotes\"**¬†from the excerpt that you think captures the essence of the Renaissance's contribution to education.\n3.¬†**1 question**¬†that you would like to pose to our learning community (either a point for clarification and/or a reflection question to help us connect to our current context).\n\n**1. 3 IDEAS**\n\t1. Individual humanism: Students of Renaissance schools were exposed to three previously unknown aspects of life: the vibrant life of the past, the subjective world of the emotions, and the world of nature. \n\t2. Individual humanism: Vittorino representing the advent of the professional teacher: pioneering the formulation of important doctrines, championing the development of interest and critical thinking, advocating for holistic development (e.g. importance of physical activity and play)\n\t3. Social humanism: The humanistic educators of the north proposed methods way ahead of their time, such as _The Liberal Education of Children_ and _The Method of Study_. \n**2. 2 QUOTES**\n\t1. Individual humanism: \"Sufficient motivation was to be found in the fact that the higher posts of honor and activity in the life of the times were open only to those who had been thoroughly trained in the humanistic manner.\" (p. 168)\n\t2. Social humanism: \"Where the child doth well, let the master praise him and say, 'Here ye do well,' for there is no such whetstone to sharpen a hard wit and encourage a will to learning, as is praise.\" (p. 172)\n**3. 1 QUESTION:** \"How exactly did broad humanism transition into 'Ciceronianism' (did it naturally happen, or did something trigger it)?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.731605397Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2023-02-28":{"title":"2023-02-28","content":"## Discerning Life Questions\n#DLQ10 #religion #spirituality #philosophy\n\n- [[Sources/Being the Beloved]]\n- [[Sources/Henri Nouwen on Brokenness]]\n\n## Historical and Philosophical Foundations of Education\n#EDUC101i #history #philosophy #education \n\n### Module 3.2:¬†**Reformation**\n_Then, we will see how the \"comeback\" of Religion as a force in education comes to be, with a special mention of the role of the Jesuits in this movement._\n\n#### The Protestant Reformation\n- In response to humanism, what follows is what is referred to in history as the \"reformation\". In this module, we look into 2 movements, led by 2 religious groups: the Protestants and the Catholics.\n- Here's an interesting thought exercise to get you started: **If you were part of a religious group, observing the movements during the Renaissance, how would you react? What would you critique?**\n- Your logic will probably lead you to why these two religious groups felt the need for \"reformation\".\n\n**[History 101: The Protestant Reformation | National Geographic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IATyzSAjC1w)**\n- The Reformation was a revolution of religion in Western Europe. Essentially, it was the result of ==centuries worth of political and social grievances against the Christian Church== as it existed.\n- This tension was exacerbated by the transformative social and intellectual period known as the Renaissance. In particular, this period involved the rise of [[Humanism]]: a philosophy that shifted man's faith from being determined by religious doctrine to being ==determined by man himself==\n- However, one of the most well-known advocates for a reformed Christian church was a German priest named **Martin Luther**. Martin Luther began to question the church in the early 1500s. He believed it was abusing its power and disagreed with some of its practices.\n\t- E.G. he challenged the church's doctrine that stated the Pope, not the Bible, was the ultimate spiritual authority\n\t- Plus he criticized the church for selling indulgences: the practice of purchasing forgiveness for one sins by giving money to the church\n- Luther believed the church needed to revise its doctrine by returning to the Bible's teachings and by saying that ==salvation could be granted by faith in Christ alone.==\n- So on October 31st 1517, Luther took a stand -- what's considered the birth of the Protestant Reformation. Luther is said to have nailed ==95 theses or arguments against the church== on to the door of Castle Church in Wittenberg, Germany.\n\t- Luther was later put on trial in front of church officials to defend his theses but in January 1521 the church declared Luther a heretic and excommunicated him\n- Unlike Luther's predecessors who challenged the church, Luther had one tool at his disposal -- that they didn't have the **printing press**. This new invention allowed his arguments to be ==copied and spread across Europe==\n- This unprecedented access to ideas such as Luther's inspired many others to challenge the church there by splitting Christianity into two major denominations: **Catholic** and **Protestant** (from the word protest).\n- Also the Bible became more accessible. Luther and other reformists translated biblical text from Latin (which was only known by nobility and church officials) to German, English, and French languages (spoken by the general public).\n- While the Protestant Reformation revolutionised the Christian faith, it had ramifications that extended beyond religion.\n\t- Prior to the Reformation, ==many Europeans were dependent on an educated upper class.==\n\t- But perhaps the most resounding impact of the Reformation was that ==the common people were empowered to question religion and other aspects of life.==\n- The Reformation (along with technological innovations and the introduction of other new ideas) gave many in Europe'sgeneral public the freedom and power to decide their own fate\n\nAfter watching the video, read The Reformers Attitude Towards Education\n\n**Guide questions:**\n\u003e1. In what way was Protestant education different from the prevailing educational thought at that time (renaissance/humanism)?\n\u003e2. What educational issues did the reforms addressed?\n\n**Additional reading**\n- [How the Reformation Reformed Education](http://blogs.belhaven.edu/asfaculty/2017/10/30/how-the-reformation-reformed-education/)\n- [How Reformation Shaped Education](https://www.thecollector.com/how-protestant-reformation-shaped-modern-education/)\n\n#### Catholic Reformation\nSo, how did the Catholic Church respond to the protestant reformation? Here, we'll learn about another reformation (referred to as the counter-reformation), this time within the Catholic Church (Watch out for a special mention of the Jesuits).\n\nAside from the Jesuits, three other groups contributed to the propagation of the educational thought of the catholic reform movement.¬† These were the Brethren of Christian Schools, the Port Royalists and the convent schools. Read¬†The Catholic Reformers Attitude Toward Education (Wilds \u0026 Lottich, pp. 190-197)¬†to find out about the contribution of these congregation to contemporary education.\n\n##### Discussion Board\n\u003e Think about the education during the counter-reformation period and answer the following questions:\n\u003e **N**- ¬†What ¬†new idea that you learned about education during the reformation/counter-reformation period?\n\u003e **E**¬†¬†- What do you find exciting about education during this period?\n\u003e **W¬†-**¬†What do you find worrisome ?\n\u003e **S¬†¬†-**¬†What suggestion can you give to improve contemporary education based on the ideas of the Catholic reformers?\n\n**N**- ¬†What ¬†new idea that you learned about education during the reformation/counter-reformation period?\n\nA new idea I learned was how the religious teaching orders‚Äô genius for organization served as the foundation for the structure of¬†modern American education.\n\nExamples of contributions from the Protestants:\n-   The Saxony system was the first state school system of history.\n-   Strum initiated the first development of a graded school system of organization by projecting a ten-class organization (a class-a-year plan).\n-   Strum‚Äôs school also served as one of the first examples of school consolidation, being the combined result of three inefficient classical schools.\n\nExamples of contributions from the Catholics:\n-   Schools run by Catholic teaching orders were considered effective institutions for learning. This is because of their highly structured educational organization.¬†This can be seen in the hierarchy of these orders, which were typically based on the military. The organizations of their schools were also documented in manuals such as the Jesuits‚Äô¬†Ratio Studiorum¬†and the Christian Brothers‚Äô¬†Conduct of Schools.\n-   Noteworthy features of the Jesuit organization were the careful selection and placing of teachers, along with the close supervision of all instruction by the Prefect of Studies.\n-   Meanwhile, the Christian Brothers were known for their flexibility, constantly modifying and expanding their education organization to keep pace with new conditions and demands. This can be seen in their inclusion of industrial schools, reform schools, commercial schools, secondary schools, and colleges.\n\n**E**¬†¬†- What do you find exciting about education during this period?\n\nWhat I find exciting are the innovative contributions Roman Catholic teaching orders made to the development of educational method. I believe that all their teaching devices and methods are still worthy of study because they are still applicable to education today.\n\nOne example I love is how the Jesuits advocated for high quality learning. The steps of their teaching method, prelection and repetition, ensured that the process of acquiring knowledge was realistic, progressive, and effective process. What makes this even more appealing to me is how teaching was always adapted to the pupils‚Äô abilities and interests.\n\nAnother Jesuit method that appeals to me is the development of devices for producing motivation, particularly the stimulation of rivalry and emulation. As a naturally competitive person, I can definitely say that this instinct has constantly pushed me towards pursuing excellence.\n\nHowever, I acknowledge that cultivating individual or group rivalry can get unhealthy. Because of this, I lean more towards the Jansenist method of auto-emulation, or desire to surpass one‚Äôs past efforts.\n\n**W¬†-**¬†What do you find worrisome?\n\nWhat I find worrisome is how classrooms became places of gloom and terror for children during this period. Martin Luther wouldn‚Äôt have wanted this, having advocated tor student-centered ideas (e.g. attractive classrooms, pleasant study, adaptation of subject matter, consideration for disposition).¬†But due to excessive formalism and severe theology, students were subjected to institutional control. They were no longer taught to think for themselves. This even happened in Protestant schools, given that they no longer followed their founder‚Äôs ideals (i.e. exaltation of individual reason and faith).\n\n**S¬†¬†-**¬†What suggestion can you give to improve contemporary education based on the ideas of the Catholic reformers?\n\nInspired by the ideas of the Catholic reformers, a suggestion I have for improving contemporary education is the Jansenists‚Äô prioritization of reason over memory. They insisted that ‚Äúnothing be memorized except what was understood‚Äù; the new textbooks they wrote were based on this idea.¬†Much of contemporary education (especially in the Philippines) consists of rote learning; this can be seen everywhere, from our history textbooks to our college entrance exams. As a neurodivergent student, this focus on memory has made learning a struggle for me. No matter how hard I review or study, I cannot retain information as well as my neurotypical peers. Thus, in order to make contemporary education more accessible, I believe prioritizing the development of reason (particularly critical thinking) is crucial.\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.731605397Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2023-03-05":{"title":"2023-03-05","content":"## Great Books\n#IDS147 \n### Assignment 1: The personal response\n#### Task\nHere is a quote about modernism from Filipino poet and Ateneo teacher, Mr. Ramon 'Rayvi' Sunico:\n\n\u003e_Before modernism, our eyes were windows through which we saw reality.

Introduction\n\t1. Hook: \n\t\t1. Humanity has a deep fear of the unknown, and this shows in how we treat our unconscious.\n\t\t\t1. Thinking with your brain is deemed rational, while following your heart is considered irrational.\n\t\t\t2. This then extends to the disregard of the individual in mass society\n\t\t2. But instead of regarding our psyche as an inflictor of blindness, what if we viewed it as a new kind of sight?\n\t\t3. This is the question brought up by modernism\n\t2. Thesis statement: Modernism shows us that that an objective reality is nonexistent to us; this is because we always perceive it subjectively, through the lens of our psyche.\n\t\t1. Give a summary of essay? To transition?\n2. Windows versus Screens \n\t1. The modern condition acts as a screen; unlike windows, which show us the external world, screens reflect our internal world.\n\t\t1. I believe that there is so much more meaning hidden underneath this statement. \n\t2. To uncover this, I want to dissect the function of windows and screens by analyzing them as forms of media. Both of these objects stand in between spaces (e.g. outdoors-indoors; physical-digital), which enables them to *mediate* the viewing experience between them. Thus, our views are dictated by windows and screens. \n\t\t1. One may assume that the transparency of windows allows only truthful perspectives, while the opaqueness of screens enables the imagination to go wild.\n\t\t2. But are they really as different as we think? This is something I'd like to counter. \n\t3. Windows\n\t\t1. While windows provide clear views of what is outside, they can  also conceal us from what is on the other side.\n\t\t2. The main reason is their function as a barrier, physically separating us from the other side. \n\t\t3. This produces an effect of paranormic perception, wherein we disassociate ourselves from the objects we watch because they belong to a different space. \n\t\t4. And just as the window separates humans from objects, gazing  from behind a window separates us from the people we see. \n\t\t\t1. This division provides a kind of invisibility, explaining why people-watching is such an appealing activity. Perceiving strangers face-to-face is uncomfortable; having a safe space to watch from (like a building or car) removes this tension, which frees us to observe and judge other people.\n\t\t\t2. However, this invisibility inherently clouds our perspective; the people we see outside are reduced to our perceptions of them. \n\t\t\t\t1. What windows represent: \"That is how we see the world: we see it existing outside ourselves, and yet we have only a mental representation of it inside ourselves.\t\n\t\t5. And in line with this, we are reminded of how windows frame our views.\n\t\t\t1. This goes both ways. Take for example a building. Those inside it get a fixed view of the world outside, while those outside it get a fixed view of the building's interior.\n\t\t\t2. We can apply this to our internal perception and external presentation. The world as we see it will always be defined by our psyche; meanwhile, the way we are seen in the world  will always be defined by social identifiers. \n\t\t6. Thus, I'd argue that windows are actually screens.\n\t\t\t1. Despite promising authenticity through transparency, the  incomplete views they provide inherently create their own reality.\n\t\t\t2. This is the modern perspective.\n\t4. Screens\n\t\t1. As exemplified by windows, the screen as a medium is seemingly neutral, yet apparently biased. It affects the viewer through manipluation, which manifests in many ways:\n\t\t2. First, screens manipluate **bodies.**\n\t\t\t1. Screens serve as safeguards. They can do this by acting as dividers, buffers, and protectors.\n\t\t\t3. However, this form of protection can also become a means of enclosure.\n\t\t\t\t1. The same walls used to shield people from the elements can also be used to detain them.\n\t\t\t\t2. Similarily, our psyches can act as prisons. They could lead us to withdraw into ourselves, closing us off from the people around us. \n\t\t3. Second, screens manipluate **information.**\n\t\t\t1. Screens function as filters, simultaenously transmitting and translating the information it intercepts.\n\t\t\t2. This inherently involves exclusion, for interpretation is impossible without this. When information is processed to be comprehendible, there will always be meaning lost in translation. Thus, the screen becomes as a censor.\n\t\t\t3. This kind of censorship can be seen in the mass society's approach to knowledge. Due to its rational viewpoint, collective and scientific knowledge is valued more than self-knowledge.\n\t\t\t\t1. Add more examples from Jung chapter 1\n\t\t4. Third, screens manipluate **images.**\n\t\t\t1. Screens serve as both displays and masks. Take for example Plato's Allegory of the Cave. Acting as a screen, the cave wall presents shadows to the prisoners while also concealing the objects these shadows come from. What this shows us is that both neutrality and bias can be found in a screen's projection.\n\t\t\t2. This paradox is also exemplified by psychological dualism ‚Äî the human person's capacity for good and evil. Our split condition can fragment our image of reality, dividing it into worlds of light and darkness. If we fail to acknowledge our divided nature, we could end up projecting evil onto others, for this is easier to do compared to recognizing evil in ourselves.\n\t\t5. Finally, screens manipluate **memory.**\n\t\t\t1. At first, screens are seen as reflective surfaces, displaying only what is in front of it. But mass media like television, films, and websites show how screens can also act as storage. So what if screens could store experience? Just as screens censor information, experiences conveyed by screens would become inherently warped.\n\t\t\t3. This is best shown by Sigmund Freud's concept of the screen memory: a seemingly trivial childhood memory that is used to cover an associated significant memory. People unwittingly use screen memories to protect themselves from repressed traumas or desires. \n\t\t\t4. Here, we can see how the psyche screens our experiences to leave us with acceptable memories; these screen memories then enable us to maintain the fiction of a stable identity.\n3. Reflection\n\t1. What we can take away from the analogy of windows and screens is that all we see through the lens of modernism is our shadowy internal life.  This life can affect our external world by alienating us from others, restricting our learning, tainting our perceptions, and repressing our memories. Despite the darkness it holds, our psyche only becomes truly detrimental to us when is ignored; by acknowledging its influence, we can learn to live with it. \n\t2. The key to this lies in self-knowledge, which we can acquire through exploring our unconscious. Contrary to common belief, our shadow self need not be an enemy; if we address this self (a.k.a. shadow work), we would gain psychological insights that we could then integrate into our personality. \n\t3. I myself can vouch for the benefits of this process. \n\t\t1. Growing up in a psychologically and financially difficult family situation has deeply scarred me. \n\t\t2. I believed this \"marked\" me for life, deeming me an outcast in a culture driven by close ties. For me, it explained why it was so hard to connect with most people; only those who experienced similar circumstances could bear getting close to me. \n\t\t3. I became a workaholic, pursuing success in hopes of covering this \"mark\", but this trauma continued to bleed into my life; this would end up causing harm to myself and my loved ones.\n\t\t4. Setting aside the time to process my experiences (through conversations with friends, therapists, and myself) enabled me to reframe my mindset. My trauma may have clouded my perpsective of reality, but I believe it has also enrichened it, for it gives me a deeper understanding of human nature. In the past, I assumed the worst in people; now, I understand that everyone comes from a place of pain, and those who hurt others simply haven't addressed their own pains. I wouldn't have been able to adopt this viewpoint if I haven't gone through my own suffering.\n\t4. Thus, I call everyone to embrace this way of seeing. Reality as we know it may not exist, but modernism shows us that we have the power to create our own reality. So will you choose to stay blind, or keep your eyes open? \n\n- in the age of mass communication, windows give us flat images\n- windows are static, while screens are always changing\n- screens and willpower\n\t- we can chooose what to see\n- acts as a filter...an inherently biased function. Screens both handle and sense the information it intercepts. Knowledge that passes through this filter exhibits bias\n- The screen as a translator become   corrupted. ==The bias of the message of the translator encloses the receptor   from the true information.== Screening fundamentally involves such exclusion because it is an inherent characteristic of the screen; it cannot interpret   without excluding. Thus man, already dependent on information, becomes dependent   on the screen for censorship.\n- eyes as windows to the soul?\n- Authenticity opens the path towards self-realization. We must not repress our darkness, but rather confront it.\n\n###### Writing Dump\nAs exemplified by windows, screens are seemingly neutral, yet apparently biased. They affect the viewer through manipulation, which manifests in many ways. First, screens manipulate bodies. Screens serve as dividers, safeguarding us from the potentially harmful. However, this form of protection can also become a means of enclosure. The same walls used to shield people from the elements can also be used to detain them. Similarly, our psyches can act as prisons. They could lead us to withdraw into ourselves, isolating us from others.\n\nSecond, screens manipulate information. Screens function as filters, simultaneously transmitting and translating the information they intercept. But inherently involves exclusion; when information is processed to be comprehensible, there will always be meaning lost in translation. Thus, the screen enables censorship. This can be seen in society's approach to knowledge, wherein collective and scientific knowledge is valued more than self-knowledge. As a result, an individual‚Äôs insight and reflection is often crushed, making them vulnerable to ideological fanaticism.\n\nThird, screens manipulate images. Screens serve as both displays and masks. We can see this in Plato's Allegory of the Cave; acting as a screen, the cave presents shadows to the prisoners while also concealing the objects these shadows come from. What this shows us is that both neutrality and bias can be found in a screen's projection. This paradox is also exemplified by psychological dualism. Our split condition can fragment our image of reality, dividing it into worlds of light and darkness. If we fail to acknowledge our divided nature, we could end up projecting evil onto others, for this is easier to do compared to recognizing evil in ourselves.¬†\n\nFinally, screens manipulate memory. Screens are typically seen as reflective surfaces, displaying only what is in front of it. But mass media like television, films, and websites show how screens can also act as storage. So what if screens could store experience? Just as screens censor information, experiences conveyed by screens would become inherently warped. This is best shown by the screen memory: a seemingly trivial childhood memory that is used to repress an associated significant memory, such as a life-changing trauma or deviant desire. Here, we can see how the psyche screens our experiences to leave us with acceptable memories; these memories then enable us to maintain the fiction of a stable identity.\n\n¬†What windows and screens show us is that all we see through the lens of modernism is our internal life. This can affect our external world by alienating us from others, restricting our learning, tainting our perceptions, and repressing our memories.\n\n##### Draft 2\n###### Outline\n1. Introduction\n\t1. Hook: We all have a deep fear of the unknown, and this shows in our treatment of the unconscious. \n\t\t1. Thinking with your brain is deemed rational, while following your heart is considered irrational. \n\t\t2. But instead of regarding our psyche as an inflictor of blindness, what if we viewed it as a new kind of sight? \n\t\t3. This is what I thought of when I read Mr. Sunico‚Äôs quote, seeing how modernism has turned our eyes from windows to screens. \n\t2. Thesis: This conceptualization shows that an objective reality is nonexistent to us; this is because we always perceive it subjectively, through the lens of our psyche.\n\t3. Summary: In this essay, I will be explaining my understanding of modernity by dissecting windows and screens BLANK\n2. Windows v.s. Screens\n\t1.   According to Mr. Sunico, windows show us the external world, while screens reflect our internal world.\n\t2. What if we interpreted these objects as forms of media? \n\t\t1. Both stand in between spaces, which enables them to mediate the viewing experience between them. Thus, our viewpoints are dictated by windows and screens.¬† \n\t3. One may assume that the transparency of windows only shows what is true, while the opacity of screens highlights the imaginary.\n\t4. However, I would like to argue that windows and screens are not as different as they seem.\n\t5. While windows provide clear views of what is outside, they are also capable of concealing us from what is on the other side.\n\t6. This also reminds us of how windows frame our views.\n\t7. Thus, I believe that windows are actually screens.\n\t\t1. Despite promising authenticity through transparency, the incomplete views they provide inherently create their own reality. \n\t\t2. This is what characterizes the modern condition.\n3. Connection to Demian \n\t1. Reality is created by our own perceptions as opposed to the perceptions of others (Identity, Fragmentation)\n\t2.   The journey to the self can be terrifying (Alienation)\n\t\t1. Tensions of the modernist\n4. Connection to Personal Life\n\n\n- Self-realization is a Lifelong process...‚ÄúI have been and still am a seeker, but I have ceased to question stars and books; I have begun to listen to the teaching my blood whispers to me.‚Äù\n\n- Screens can manipluate our bodies, information, images, and memories.\n\t-  find a focus?\n\t- Screens show us how all we see through the lens of modernism is our internal life\n\n\n- just because it isn't bonafide (it deceives) doesn't mean it isn't real","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.731605397Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2023-03-06":{"title":"2023-03-06","content":"## Majestic Ship\n### Information\n- http://majesticship.com.ph/\n- The goal is to draw in new customers who are not familiar with the company yet.

To him, education and religion were inseparable; gaining an education helped people to build God's kingdom on earth. \n- The purpose of education was to fulfill **the 12 Human Desires**:\n\t- To live \n\t- To have an enduring healthy life\n\t- To know one's surroundings, that is, a perceptive life \n\t- To have understanding, that is, an enlightened life \n\t- To have a life of freedom, that is, to wish and choose what one understands to be good and to refuse and reject the evil \n\t- To have an active life \n\t- To have and hold many possessions\n\t- To enjoy the use of property with a sense of security \n\t- To live an honorable life \n\t- To be able to communicate with others effectively \n\t- To have a peaceful life \n\t- To have eternal life\n- Comenius called life **The School of God's Wisdom.** This was divided into three different schools:\n\t- The Physical School: consisted of the book of nature or the physical world around us. Here, we use our senses to gain knowledge\n\t- The Metaphysical School: involved the book of the human mind. Here, people would use their mind and reason to analyze and discover complex concepts.\n\t- The Hyperphysical School: dealt with things of God as found in the Holy Scriptures. In this school, learning is done by faith.\n- the education ofchildren needed to be developmentallyappropriate he needed to build uponprior knowledge what we would callscaffolding today education should beenjoyable with positive reinforcementfostering the love of learning\n- children learnbest through hands-on experientiallearning it also needed to go at thechild's pace and follow their interestsand talents\n- In conclusion, John Amos Comenius believed that as God's children, everyone should use their senses reason and faithto voluntarily gain a thorough educationof God and the world he created so theycould fulfill the 12 human desires\n\n#### Jean Jacques Rosseau: Realizing the Natural Self\nHere we'll meet another modern thinker, Jean Jacques Rousseau.¬†Rousseau was an 18th century philosopher who later became known as a revolutionary philosopher on education and a forerunner of Romanticism.\n\n##### [Political Theory - Jean Jacques Rosseau](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81KfDXTTtXE)\n- Modern Life is deeply attracted to theidea of progress\n- from that point onRusso's life was marked by deepinstability in isolation\n- one day in 1749 he read a copyof a newspaper the method of course thatcontained an advert for an essay onsubject of weather recent advances inarts and sciences had contributed towhat was called the purification ofmorals in other words was the worldgetting better\n- Rousseau experiencedsomething of an epiphany it struck himthat civilization and progress had notin fact improved people instead they had enacted a terrible destructiveinfluence on the morality of humanbeings who had once been good\n- Russa tookthis insight and turned it into thecentral thesis of what became hiscelebrated discourse on the Arts andSciences\n- his argument was simpleindividuals had once been good and happybut as people had emerged from their presocial state and joined society they hadbecome plagued by vice and sin\n- thatRousseau thought had corrupted peopleand led to moral degeneracy Rousseauclaimed that the march towardcivilization had awakened in people anunhealthy form of self-love a more pophe called it something that wasartificial and centered around pridejealousy and vanity Rousseau argued thatthis destructive form of self-love had\n- emerged as people had moved into citiesand there had begun to comparethemselves to others and created theiridentities solely by reference to theirneighbors civilized people had stoppedthinking about what they wanted and theyfelt and merely imitated other peopleentering into ruinous competitions forstatus and money and losing sight oftheir own sensations\n- Rousseau is foreverassociated with a term noble savagebecause it was his work that describedthe innocence and morality of ourancestors and contrasted it with modern decadence at the time\n- ofnatureRousseau's interest in natural goodnessmade him very interested in the ideathough not quite the reality ofchildren in 1762 he wrote Emil or on education perhaps the most successfulbook ever written about how to raisechildren\n- Rousseau suggested thatchildren were born naturally good andthat the key to raising them wastherefore always to prevent theircorruption by society this idea waswidely influential parents who it beforethis time seen their children as wickedor at best as blank slates now viewedthem as found sub wisdom and tried togive them a childhood full of play andvisits to forests and lakes Rousseaubecame the inventor of child centered education\n- he was also a great proponentof breastfeeding declaring let mothersdeign to nurse their children and moralswill reform themselves nature'ssentiments will be awakened in everyheart and the state will be re peopledit\n- to himthese weren't trivial or self-absorbedtopics they were part of an important task to show what living is like\n- Rousseaucan be considered as one of the founding figures of what we now know as theRomantic movement an ideologyresponsible for valuing the primitiveover the civilized the child over theadult the passionate lover over thecalmly loyal spouse\n- the modern worlddespite its addiction to statusmachinery and capitalist values in manyways continues to be profoundly romanticin its heart\n\n\n##### Naturalism Summary\n1. **What is education for?**\n\t1. systemso when you think about it uma lot of the perceptions about whateducation is for maybe apart from thehumanists that took a moreindividualistic perspectivea lot of the other perspectives arereally coming from a perspective thateducation is to prepare a personfor something outside the person (e.g. religion/philosophy/society)\n\t2. one thing that the naturalists recognizeis nature and when they talk aboutnature it's not justnature meaning what you see outside liketrees the environment but also thenature of a personthatthey use this particular notion to shapetheir particular philosophywherein what they're saying here is thateducation is not necessarily to make apersonsomeone other than the personas if there was something wrong with theperson fundamentally butwe have to begin to recognize thateveryone is fundamentally good or atleast that's what they believed in andsince everyone is fundamentally goodif the goal of education is to shape agood personthen the role of education is reallyjust to allow the person to be good orto allow the person to develop to be thegood person that they are naturally arethey naturally are\n2. **What is the \"bias\"?**\n\t1. Naturalists will probably have a bias for ==human instincts==\n\t2. for naturalists this is one of thebiggest ideas most especially in termsof methodology of educationthat for them and their perspective it'simportant just to allow a child to be achild to allow a child toto grow in their own particular wayto allow their instincts to not restricttheir instincts\n\t3. Contrast to [[Monasticism]]\n\t4. for them discipline should benatural should be driven by naturalpunishment meaning just allow thenatural consequences to happen and theywill learn from itsomaybe\n3. **How should education be?**\n\t1. [[Naturalism]] is a bridge between sense realism and developmentalism \n\t2. naturalism definitely builds on thisit acknowledges that this is animportant part of learning and educationshould be like this but builds on thisand extends thethe definition of of realismuh by saying that when you talk aboutwhat rea what is real we have to look atnature and nature not just in terms ofthe environment uh but also the natureof the person and when we look at thenature of the person one thing thatnaturalism will say is that everyone isinertly good and so the goal ofeducation is just to bring out thatgoodness and to allow that goodness toflourishsome\n\t\t1. some of you might feel like oh my thisis pretty extreme right like no controldo we mean no control do we just allowstudents to go as they areand maybe to a certain extent this iswhypure naturalism is not so much existentin modern education todaysowhat\n\t3. psychological developmentalism is reallysomething that builds on this or thatrecognizes some of the limitations ofthe perspective of naturalistsand sort of cures itand when you look at developmentalismyou'll begin to recognize that most ofthese thingsare quite close to current practiceso\n\n##### Key Ideas about [[Naturalism]]\n1. **Nature v.s. \"artificial\"**\n\t1. \"Return to the natural as opposed to all that is artificial\" (244)\n\t2. Naturalism opposed many existing paradigms and practices in education:\n\t\t1. \"Education as a procedure to be *imposed* from without\"\n\t\t2. Specialization: Education aimed at *producing* workers, citizens, and members of society. \"Education, in making a worker or a citizen, made him less a man.\"\n\t\t3. \"The child is *not to be swaddled*, confined, or rocked but must be allowed the utmost freedom of limb and voice...\"\"\n2. **Nature of individual growth**\n\t1. \"To educate an individual, one must understand the nature of his growth\" (244)\n\t2. Naturalism proposes that morality be naturally developed from consequence.\n\t\t1. \"Rosseau merely permitted the pupil to suffer the natural results of his own acts.\"\n\t3. Naturalism proposed that education followed nature\n\t\t1. Organization *(Individual first, social after)*\n\t\t\t1. Infancy\n\t\t\t2. Childhood\n\t\t\t3. Boyhood\n\t\t\t4. Adolescence\n\t\t2. Order of Nature *(Principle of Growth)*\n\t\t\t1. Need \n\t\t\t2. Activity\n\t\t\t3. Experience\n\t\t\t4. Knowledge\n3. **Nature as content and method**\n\t1. \"Educatirs should 'diligently observe nature and learn from her' study her methods and base their own upon them\" (244)\n\t3. Naturalism proposed that education should be experienced.\n\t\t1. Principle of pupil-activity\n\t\t2. \"Nothing must be done for the pupil that he can do for himself\"\n\t\t3. \"Do not give your pupil any sort of verbal lesson, for he is to be taught only by experience.\"\n\t\t4. \"The teach must start with these elements which the child's senses can grasp, and attempt always to associate the 'the word and the object referred to'\" (Cornenius)\n\t4. Naturalism considers learners as individuals.\n\t\t1. Principle of individualization\n\t\t2. \"The interests and needs of the individual must be placed above those of society: individuality must not be sacrificed for social stability.\"\n\t\t3. \"Do not undertake any teaching...without first arousing the interest of the pupil\" (Cornenius)\n\t\t4. \"The children will be engaging in studies which will given them as much pleasure as if they had spent the day playing games.\" (Cornenius)\n\n##### Discussion Board\n1. For Rousseau what is most important/ should be prioritized in education?\n2. What are the similarities of Comenius' and Rousseau's views on education?\n\nWhat Rosseau saw as most important in education was preserving natural goodness and virtues, and forming a new society based on the realization of these qualities by all its members. This perspective was formed against modern life's conception of progress; unlike the modernists, who believed that recent advances in arts and sciences contributed to the purification of morals, he believed that civilization and progress corrupted the morality of human beings, who had once been good.\n\nDespite how different their perspectives were (i.e. religious v.s. secular), both Comenius and Rosseau advocated for universal education. This was because they believed that it is a human birthright; the former believed in inherent human dignity (which comes from being created in God's image) while the latter believed in natural human rights. Aside from this, they also advocated for child-centered education. This is reflected in their intentions; both see schools as places for kids to just express themselves. It is also reflected in their preferences for teaching; both believe that education must incorporate scaffolding, focus on hands-on experiental learning, and align itself with the interests of the child.\n","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.731605397Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2023-03-16":{"title":"2023-03-16","content":"## Contemporary Issues: Psychology and Personal Growth\n#psychology #personaldevelopment \n### Slavery and Freedom\n#### Journeys and Crossroads\n\n##### **[Magisterial Lectures | Roberto Conrado Guevara PhD - On Journeys \u0026 Crossroads: Reflections on Exodus](https://youtu.be/geVah0hecPQ)\n\n\u003e We end the different modules with the coming together of the personal and communal.\n\u003e In this video, Bobby Guevara talks about the concept of slavery and freedom from a personal stance. Think about how slavery and freedom applies to you and your personal development.\n\n#religion #spirituality \n- **The Reality of Slavery**\n\t- The phenomenal growth of the children of Israel leads to the people's enslavement: \"...they set taskmasters over them to oppress with forced labor... The Egyptians became ruthless in imposing tasks on the Isarelites, and made their lives bitter with hard service\" (Ex. 1:11, 13-14)\n\t- Insight #1: **You might not like slavery, but after a while, you get used to it.**\n\t\t- E.G. Spanish colonization, Martial Law\n- **The Story of Exodus and the Reality of Unfreedom**\n\t- \"...[W]e have constructed patterns in our lives--patterns in relationships, patterns at work, and so often, self-defeating patterns, which undermine our best interests...There is always a 'logical' connection between a surface symptom or pattern and a historic wounding to the soul.\" - *James Hollis, Finding Meaning in the Second Half of Life, 2005*\n\t- **[[Ignatian Spirituality]] and the Reality of Unfreedom**\n\t\t- We can see these self-defeating patterns...this form of slavery...as a invitation to greater awareness\n\t\t- \"With much 'unfreedom' in us we will never be able to do serious discernment and we will just continue to be at the mercy of our attachments.\" *- Ramon Maria Luza Bautista, S.J., Schooled by the Spirit, 2009*\n\t- \"Where is your brother?\" (Gen 4:9). Where is your brother or sister who is enslaved? Where is the brother and sister whom you are killing each day in clandestine warehouses, in rings of prostitution, in children used for begging, in exploiting undocumented labour? Let us not look the other way...The issue involves everyone!\" *- Pope Francis, Evangelii Gaudium #211* \n\t\t- Pope Francis wishes for all of us to hear God's cry.\n\t\t- He tells us not to look the other way, because these issues involve everyone.\n\t\t- Reflect on the question of slavery that is amidst us: Who are our brothers and sisters? The ones whose lives have been made bitter by oppression?\n\t\t- The invitation for greater awareness is not again meant to bring us to a dark place, but really an invitation for deeper compassion and for deeper solidarity\n\t- **The Cry**\n\t\t- \"The Isarelites groaned under their slavery, and cried out.... [T]heir cry for help rose up to God. God heard their groaning... remembered his covenant...and took notice of them\" (Ex. 2:23-25)\n\t\t- The crying out is important because without the crying out, you just end up returning to Egypt. You just end up returning to slavery. The crying out, it's not just an expression of misery you knowthe crying out is also a complaint it'salso a protestit's also an acknowledgement that thingsare not rightthe crying out is the first sign ofopenness to the hopeful expectationthat slavery is not the last wordi\n\t\t- E.G. Student praying to God in a retreat about her anger and resentment towards her parents. By acknowledging these (and thus lifting these up to God), she felt that she had the opportunity to start anew.\n\t\t- That's what tears are all about. They are an acknowledgement that one needs to be saved.\n\t\t- Insight #2: **The basic requirement of freedom is the awareness of \"exile\", the groan of conscious alienation.** *- Avivag Gottlieb Zornberg* [[Freedom requires awareness of exile]]\n\t\t\t- Before one can be free, one must be aware that one is not free. That awareness is manifested in the crying out.\n\t\t\t- [[Cards/Freedom is being conscious of your constraints]]\n\t\t\t- [[Cards/The alternative to freedom is unconsciousness]]\n\t\t- **Ignatian Spirituality and Self-Awareness**\n\t\t\t- Saint [[Ignatius of Loyola]] says that one of the temptations of the evil spirit is to tell us to keep your weakness in the dark. Just keep it hidden, don't let it be known. But we know the change begins when we are able to bring our weakness into the light.\n\t\t\t- \"As [[Ignatius of Loyola]] observes, the enemy of human nature does fear discovery. While our weaknesses remain unacknowledged or closeted away, we are powerless over them. The sometimes painful process of dragging our weaknesses into full light of day by understanding them is the first empowering stride toward conquering them.\" *- Chris Lowney, Heroic Leadership, 2003*\n\t\t\t- Related to insights from #DLQ10 \n\t\t\t\t- [[Cards/The wound is the place where the Light enters you]]\n\t\t\t\t- [[Cards/Brokenness]]\n\t\t- \"When the heart is able to ask itself and weep, then we can understand something... Dear young boys and girls, today's world doesn't know how to cry...[[Certain realities of life we only see through eyes cleansed by our tears]].

The Lord will fight for you, and you have only to be still.\"\n\t\t- Moses uses the word see 3 times. This was probably deliberate because you have to remember that what caused Israel's fear was what they looked at. What caused their fear was what they saw.

When more \"modern\" systems of wealth creation were possible, such as learning a trade and selling your products, or inventing something and employing workers to produce, it was no longer the monarch that was in power but ==those who could have power over production, selling, and of course, earning.== \n- In this system, the poor were no longer tenant farmers but factory workers, cogs in a wheel of production. Now, not everyone is a factory worker but the same system is visible even in corporations, where the \"lower tier\" workers are paid less than those on top. The problem with this relationship is ==the work that a person does does not equal what the person earns and someone (or someones) on the top earn the most for doing the least work.==\n- So, the question that we are forced to confront is¬†_what is the value of a person? And how is that value made possible?_¬†Or, we can change these questions to¬†_how is the worth of a person determined by their relationship to a system of production_?\n\n#### Government systems and Marxist critique\n- If the world is founded on an unfair system, why is it that people don't rebel? Marx argued that eventually, the lowest worker, the proletariat, would rebel. \n- Marx liked that idea of uniting all the workers of the world, who united in an ideology of equality, would break all hierarchies that kept inequalities in place. In such a new system, ==everyone earned as much as they worked. ==\n- And, with State holding all the funds, there would be ==a stronger sense of equitability--a kind of institutionalized \"sharing\".== In this system, wealth would be fairly distributed and everyone would have equal opportunities.\n- The world has seen at least two major Communist economies, China and Russia, with Cuba too, but it's not clear to what extent this system worked, following the intentions of Marx. But that does not mean Marxist thought can't be applied, which is why, in intellectual circles, we have what is referred to as **\"Marxist critique\"**, which is ==a theoretical and practical means of challenging power and resisting the inequalities that characterize our society today.== (See [[Marxism]])\n- Challenging inequality is not easy and successes are few and hard to come by. Have you ever been conscious of how inequalities impact on the totality of our lives? And have you ever heard of or participated in movements that attempt to resist and challenge these inequalities? Did these movements work?\n\n#### The accident of our birth and the conditioning of our lives\n- It's hard to say why we were born in the families we were born in. So for many reasons, the our births seem accidental--we may have been born in burgis families, just as others may have been born in poorer or even wealthier families. But, ==that accident of birth has¬†_birthed_¬†into the conditions that formed us today. ==\n- Marx has also written about how invisible social systems keep the rich, rich, and the poor, poor. If we believe that, then who are now has everything to do with class we were born into. Do reflect on your lives and try to see to what extent this might be true for you.\n- Since systems that ensure the UNEQUAL distribution of power and wealth are invisible, ==we have accepted them.== The concept of¬†_[[Hegemony]]_, which was thought up by an Italian thinker, Antonio Gramsci, means that \"we are oppressed without knowing it\" or \"we are oppressed and we have accepted it\" or \"we have¬†_consented_¬†to the system, and we don't know it\". ==So we are happily oppressed.==\n- Have you ever felt like you had already agreed to an invisible form of oppression? So invisible that you had to think carefully to realize it?\n\n#### The role of critique\n- When Communism has succeeded as a system of government or not, it does not mean Marx is not useful. On the contrary, Marxist thought and critique are still very useful, if they are framed within a view toward making things better for all.\n- What Marxist critique does is ==it makes visible the invisible systems of power and inequality.== ==And that is what literature, art, music, film, can do.== Through these forms of creative expression, writers, artists, thinkers, and anyone who feels compelled to do so, can articulate what is invisible and reveal how systems of power have hurt and impacted on all of our lives.¬†\n- But ==critique has to be deployed in light of concrete action==--at least that is how I see it. For example if an system of gender inequality is revealed through films on LGBTQ++, then what are we supposed to do? What can we do to make things more fair?¬†\n- At this point, it's important to consider what¬†_power_¬†means.¬†To me, power equals access and choice. And these are not available to all. Why is that? Why are some more powerful than others?\n\n#### The twin concepts of fragmentation and alienation\n- Because we are all conditioned socially into certain positions, there is a chance of all of us experiencing¬†_[[Fragmentation]]_¬†and¬†_[[Alienation]]_, which result from us ==being forced in \"a place\" in the system which we don't like.== The result is, a fragmented person, who is at odds with themselves and/or an¬†_alienated_¬†one, who feels dispossessed, disenfranchised and marginalized by the system. \n- For example, students carry the burden of earning money for themselves and for their families. That can be a fragmenting moment, especially if the student does not want to earn in the manner their parents conditioned them to. That situation can also be alienating for the student who feels like their life was \"made\" for them but does not agree with what was made. It does take wisdom and growing up to deal with such a situation, if it's even possible to deal with them.\n- In other words, because of a social system that invisibly keeps us all in our place, ==we wind up with internal problems.== The system conditions us to the point where we accept the system. And that is one reason why Jung says we have no sense of self-knowledge. ==The true self, after all, may be a problem to the system because it may not at all cooperate.==\n- But, one is tempted to ask whether the chance for self-knowledge is also equally distributed.\n\n#### Reading \"Brave new world\"\nHuxley's novel is certainly a brave one! In this novel, we have the human relationship with production and order expressed in very literal ways. But, the orderliness of the brave new world of the novel has cracks, where problem areas show.

(We have to establish this now, because otherwise \"biological processes\" as a term essentially refers to the entire class.) And when we speak of these topics, what we¬†_really_¬†mean to talk about is the body, and the ways in which science fiction upholds and subverts our expectations about how the body is supposed to work.\n\n##### Sex, Gender, and Reproduction\n- We know from our previous discussions that we often equate \"normality\" with ==proximity to what we consider the human norm==: the closer a science fiction alien is to what we call a \"normal\" human body, the more familiar and less strange we find it. \n\t- We know buglike aliens, being rather far from the human shape, are often depicted as exceedingly bizarre and unknowable, while rubber forehead aliens--the species that populate works like¬†_Star Trek_--are often seen as potential allies, or at the very least opponents that might be willing to negotiate. \n- Often these distinctions apply to ==the biological processes that control these creatures' bodies==: human-shaped \"friendly\" aliens often also have two biological sexes and corresponding genders.\n\t- E.G. How do we discern if an alien is \"male\" or \"female\"? What does the question of gender even mean for aliens? And how can we come up with an instinctive answer anyways?\n- One assumption on which much of our society is based is the idea that ==one's reproductive biology is a determinant of one's identity and social role:== people with Y chromosomes are biologically male, and thus are men, who are then expected to behave in particular ways, and the same is true for people with XX chromosomes who are expected to behave in conventionally feminine ways. \n\t- Apart from both erasing intersex people and ignoring people who are transgender or otherwise gender-nonconforming, this assumption falls prey to that most common of human biases: we assume it's the only framework out there. \n\t- We can forget that¬†**gender identity and gender expression are largely social constructs**, ones that are not inherent or assigned or automatically paired with the biological characteristics with which they are often associated--something many people on Earth already know. \n- There are so many creatures on Earth for whom sex and reproduction work vastly differently than they do for us. Assuming such creatures (or aliens sharing their characteristics) even had concepts of gender identity,¬†**who's to say their reproductive biology would correspond neatly to their concepts of gender--or would even allow for gender identity in the same way that ours does?**\n- Consider the asari of¬†_Mass Effect_: a single-sex species of aliens who reproduce more or less ==parthenogenetically==: they can initiate (psychic) sexual intercourse with a counterpart of almost any sentient species of any sex, preferring non-asari to asari, and the child will be carried by the asari and will always be an asari. \n\t- The asari look and sound like blue versions of human women, and they all use female pronouns, with their stages of development being named using feminine terms: maiden, matron, and matriarch. \n\t- If the species is single-sex, why are they designed with a culture that seems so very feminine and female-inflected, from a human perspective, when part of the way we define femininity, culturally speaking, is in conversation with masculinity? \n\t- And just to add another layer to all this,¬†_Mass Effect_¬†seems aware of how strange this is and willing to deconstruct it: the¬†_Mass Effect_¬†games equip the (human) player character with a universal translator, which automatically translates alien languages into English. When the human-female-looking asari use female pronouns, those are not necessarily¬†_their_¬†words; that's the universal translator translating their language into English.¬†**What does gender mean, then, to them, and will we ever really be able to find out?**\n- Science fiction provides opportunities to question a lot of the norms around which we're used to living our lives, and ==biological sex--and the social constructs that we build around it--is no exception.== Sci-fi allows us to imagine aliens that take our assumptions about how sex, gender, and reproduction work and flip them on their heads, creating¬†**new status quos and new norms**¬†that implicitly always question the way we see things in \"the real world.\"\n\t- And that's before we even talk about parasites and pathogens.\n\n##### Parasites, Pathogens, and Body Horror\n- If science fiction can defamiliarize sex, gender, and reproduction in order to create¬†_nova_¬†which present us with alternative definitions for \"normal,\" the genre can also defamiliarize parasites and pathogens to present the opposite:¬†**estranged, hyperbolized versions of¬†*ab*normality**. Both in real life and in science fiction, ==infections are essentially what happens when \"normal\" bodily function is subverted by a foreign organism or agent, often one that seeks to use the body for its own purposes.== In real life, this can manifest as a disease or physical malady; in science fiction, this can be ==hyperbolized into terrifying infestations, mutations, or extreme physical plagues or symptoms.==\n- If sex, gender, and reproduction can be defamiliarized to ==interrogate our definitions of desire and the body==, then parasites and pathogens are often defamiliarized to ==incite fear.== Most common science fiction parasites and pathogens operate in¬†**transformation storylines,**¬†which focus on the ==corruption of the human form==--whether quickly or slowly--into something inhuman and terrifying. \n\t- These are old stories, taking the tradition of mythic curse narratives and bringing them into the realm of alien infestations and zombie viruses. \n\t- The horror is in seeing how some of our primal human fears are ==hyperbolized== and given ==physical form== in fictional afflictions which use scientific ideas to tap into real human terrors.\n- When you look at the vampire, for example, the obvious observation is that it's a bloodsucking undead monster whose bite can transform others into creatures like itself. \n\t- Depending on what texts you're reading, this can be classic fantasy as well as archetypal science fiction, hyperbolizing the idea of a virus and turning it into a curse that bestows great power at the cost of humanity. \n\t- But when you look at how vampires work, they drain bodily fluids (i.e. blood) from victims at night, often after ambushing or coercing said victims, and sometimes turn their victims by feeding them some of their own bodily fluids in turn (again, blood).\n- Add to that the fact that many older vampire stories were either about sinners or foreigners, and the fear that the vampire curse (as delivered by sinners and foreigners) might corrupt innocent young women and turn them into unclean monsters, and you start to get the idea that ==vampires are also an allegory for sex, and the human fascination with and fear of sex.== \n\t- There's something erotic about feeding, something the Bela Lugosi era of vampire movies was able to emphasize, and so our pop culture today sees vampires as \"the hot monster,\" despite the earliest movie vampire, Nosferatu (itself an attempt at adapting¬†_Dracula_) being an decidedly unsexy bat creature. \n\t- The vampire today is¬†_largely_¬†==a sign that estranges sexual desire==, hyperbolizing both its compelling and its terrifying elements, casting it as a monstrous curse that changes those it touches forever. (Or, you know, a sparkly emo teenager.)\n- This is the logic of science fiction parasites and pathogens: ==the fear of the body, which as we've seen is a signifier for normality, being turned against us.== As this year has proven, we link the normal functioning of our human bodies very closely to a sense of normality in the world (rightly or wrongly), and so the belief that there might be a fantastic agent out there that might be able to subvert our bodies towards its own inhuman ends? Terrifying as hell, and very much the subject of a lot of science fiction.\n- Sir Ron's Notes: **[Episode 10 - Body Horror: An Introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mucw86qNVSM)**\n\n#### Sci-Fi Sex\n- When we first defined evolution, we emphasized that for a trait to be subject to evolutionary forces, it must be¬†_heritable_. We've also talked about how¬†_fitness_¬†is an important element in the evolution of a population, particularly when it's evolution through natural selection. Both of these show us how important reproduction is in biology. ==It not only ensures the continuation of a genetic lineage but increases the number of individuals making up a population.== Both genetic variability and large population size make a population less prone to extinction.\n- So yes, reproduction is of absolute importance for life-forms. In fact, we can argue that ==to survive to reproductive age and be able to reproduce (essentially, to be¬†_fit_) is the most important inherent drive of organisms.== We can most likely expect the same in alien species.\n- Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED3kMKUwxXQ) for an overview of sex and reproduction on Earth and how it illuminates certain common sex-related tropes in sci-fi.\n- So there's a lot of interesting stuff going out there both on our real planet and on fictional ones! Whatever the method and how ever bizarre it is, ==the ultimate goal is to transmit the genetic material from one generation to the next.== \n\t- On Earth, casual sex without the goal of procreation is rare; aside from humans and some primates, only dolphins are known to do that. \n\t- But we can generally expect that ==the higher the consciousness and cognition levels of the alien species, the more common that non-procreative sex will be.==\n- **Sexual selection**¬†¬†is an important evolutionary force that shapes organisms, usually (but not always) the males of species. This is the main reason for¬†**sexual dimorphism**, which is the ==condition wherein the two sexes are anatomically different.== \n\t- In most species, particularly in animals, the female makes the choice and so has to be attracted by the males, which compete with each other to get the female. This means that the ==evolutionary pressure to be attractive is stronger on males than on females==, thus the evolution of traits like large body size, bright feathers, loud songs, etc. \n\t- This is largely because in most species, it's the male that benefits from having multiple sexual partners. Think about it: a male that has sex with five females within one mating period can produce offspring from all five, but a female that has sex with five males within one mating period will produce only one batch of offspring from one male. Thus, ==males spend more time looking for mates than taking care of young==, making paternal care generally uncommon.\n\t- _Can you think of sci-fi races that show this type of dichotomy between males and females?_\n- These roles can be flipped in several species, of course. \n\t- Think of the seahorse, whose males carry the young in their pouches. In those species, it's the female that courts and has sex with several partners and it's the male that takes care of the young. \n\t- Understandably, sci-fi is even more adventurous when it comes to defying conventions in sex and gender. In Ursula Le Guin's Hainish Cycle, particularly in the novel¬†_The Left Hand of Darkness_, the natives of Gethen are both male and female at once most of the time, except for a few days every month when they become sexually receptive and adopt the sexual attributes of male or female (and it may change from month to month!).¬†\n\t- _The Orville_'s Moclans have a sexual divide that's explained as much by social politics as by biology; only males are legitimate citizens because of rigid social norms but also because somehow, two males are able to produce offspring! \n\t\t- As¬†_The Martian_¬†author Andy Weir has speculated online, that probably means that the egg-laying Moclan is actually intersex (having both male and female structures functional), which might actually be the common sexual state in the species after the females were exiled from their society. \n\t- Gender and sexual roles in sci-fi can definitely teach us a thing or two about ==how diverse they are in human society and how important it is for us to make an effort to understand them.==\n\t- The¬†_Star Trek_universe, ever the bellwether on diversity and inclusivity, recently celebrated the casting of a non-binary actor and a trans actor in¬†_Star Trek: Discovery_, which in many other ways has shown itself to be the most biologically progressive installment in the franchise.\n- Sex can be messy. \n\t- In SF/horror hybrids like the¬†_Alien_¬†franchise, the gene-editing films¬†_Splice_¬†and¬†_Species_, and the Cronenberg body horror staples (particularly¬†_The Brood_), females can be as deadly as the Earth spider and insect females that eat males after sex. Just think about the Ardat-Yakshi of¬†_Mass Effect_. \n\t- The \"monstrous-feminine\" has been a common and oft-studied trope in horror and sci-fi that has horror elements. \n\t- Conversely, you have dysfunctional males like Freddy, Jason, and Michael whose true horror story from a biological perspective is that they are abominably warped men (physically and psychologically) who will not be found conventionally attractive.\n\n**Points for Discussion**\n1. Is it reasonable to assume that reproduction is as important in alien life as it is on Earth? Why or why not?\n2. What are the advantages of parthenogenesis over sexual reproduction? Why isn't it more common on Earth despite these advantages?\n3. If aberrant sexual morphologies and/or behaviors are¬†_nova_, what could they be signifying? Give specific examples.\n\n#### \"Bloodchild\" - Kid Pro Quo\n- \"Bloodchild\" by Octavia Butler is Ridley Scott's¬†_Alien_¬†franchise as an almost-wholesome dark mpreg fic, and it baffles me that I am completely serious about that entire string of words. \n\t- Drawing on the traditions of body horror, the coming-of-age story, and social science fiction, it revolves around a human boy, Gan, who lives in a human settlement on a planet dominated by the Tlic, a sapient species of large buglike aliens who have a matriarchal society and a parasitic mode of reproduction. \n\t- The humans and the Tlic have an arrangement: the Tlic protect and maintain the human reservations, and in exchange human families promise their male children to Tlic women to serve as hosts for their eggs in a process that is (usually?) not dangerous.\n- Coming-of-age texts are about ==gaining maturity at the cost of innocence: the loss of some illusion or comfort from childhood.== \n\t- Here, Gan struggles with the decision of whether or not to fulfill the duty to which his family has committed him: hosting the eggs of his Tlic intended, T'Gatoi, an influential politician and administrator. \n\t- T'Gatoi is in a position of prominence, and also is a large and terrifying (but not necessarily unkind!) bug creature, all things that represent a kind of danger, ==an inequality== between Gan and T'Gatoi. \n\t- Moreover, T'Gatoi claims that she needs to lay her eggs in someone, and if Gan does not follow up on the commitment to host her eggs, she might lay them in his younger sister instead, as Terran females are supposedly even better hosts for Tlic eggs even if they are not offered as such due to the (supposedly small) risk to the host. \n\t- If the process goes wrong, or if the Tlic larvae hatch and are not extracted in time, they might begin to eat the host from the inside, and losing a human female in this way would hurt both the humans (as they would have lost a daughter) and the Tlic (as they would have lost a potential mother for the next generation of Terrans and Tlic egg hosts alike).\n\t- Suffice it to say, Gan is scared as hell.\n- \"Bloodchild\" is a story about the ==subversion of gender roles.== This is, ultimately, a story about male pregnancy, of course, but there are many other aspects to Gan's and T'Gatoi's relationship--a synecdoche for the Terran-Tlic arrangement--that further reinforce this theme. \n\t- T'Gatoi exudes an aggressive, arguably masculine energy; Tlic eggs are deposited into Terran males via the ovipositor, an organ strongly coded with phallic symbolism. Moreover, T'Gatoi is in a position of power over Gan, both physically and politically, something echoed by all of Tlic society: most leadership roles seem to go to Tlic women, whereas Tlic men are dismissed and Terran men are made into spouses. \n\t- And Gan, for his part, spends much of the story reacting rather than enacting--even when he considers running away, it is a potential act of defiance against a role and a system that have previously been thrust upon him, rather than a decision to do something completely new. His arc is inward, emotional, and circumscribed by relationships, in a way typically associated with women in traditional patriarchy-fueled Western writing.\n- Furthermore, while the Terrans are colonists on the Tlic world, their position is not that of the standard European colonizer: they, and not the Tlic, live in reservations, and it is the Tlic who seem to retain power over the land. \n\t- The role of recipient--the person to whom things are done--is often feminized and exoticized in the colonial setup, but here, these traits are given primarily to the Terrans, despite the fact that the main point of interface (heh) between Terrans and Tlic is in the relationships between Tlic women and Terran males. \n\t- \"Bloodchild\" is an excellent example of social science fiction, the sort whose¬†_novum_¬†includes ==heightens, subverts, and otherwise affects social fabric==, and whose preoccupation with its¬†_novum_¬†includes focusing on the ==society that contextualizes it.==\n- I say \"males\" rather than \"men\" deliberately, largely because Gan here is still quite young, whereas T'Gatoi is coded as a grown woman. Here we see another interesting layer to their relationship: that of the child spouse promised to an older person, another role that is often feminized but which here is flipped on its head. \n\t- The multiple layers of imbalance, coupled with the very deliberate choice to use Gan as the point of view, mean that reading this text will always have a certain level of ambiguity: while Gan does make a decision at the climax, and while we do see the process that leads up to his decision, there will always be the question of whether we view it, ultimately, as a free choice or not. (For that matter, given his age, do we think he is even capable of consent in this situation?)\n- To further emphasize the ambiguity of¬†_Bloodchild_¬†by way of counterexample, let's detour into a mini-**Creature Spotlight**, and talk for a bit about arguably the most famous human-incubated bug alien of all time, the xenomorph from¬†_**Alien**_. \n\t- Here, the horror is unambiguous--the creature's anatomy, both as a facehugger and as an adult xenomorph, is so evocative of human anatomy, combining shapes reminiscent of sex organs, hands, and so on, but these are estranged to the point that they are horrific and frightening. \n\t- The way the facehugger \"impregnates\" the human victim isn't just subversive, as with the Tlic; the facehugger is coercive and violent, smothering the victim's face with its finger-like legs in a way that ==semiotically hides their face, erasing their personhood and reducing them to a body and an incubator for a violent, monstrous progeny.== \n\t- And the way the adult xenomorph hunts its victims is methodical, calculated, reminiscent of stalking in the worst way. There is clearly ==no consent== here; the relationship between humans and xenomorphs is terrifying, harmful, and destructive.\n- In contrast,¬†_Bloodchild_¬†is far more ambiguous in how it wants us to read it. It's kind about sex, but it also isn't. It's kind of about body horror, but it also isn't. And one of the most interesting questions is whether or not, given all of this, we can truly call this a love story. \n\t- It seems like Gan and T'Gatoi truly do care about each other, but ==given the power imbalance at play, are they ever truly able to speak as equals?== How is this affected by the fact that T'Gatoi needs Gan too? And does any of this even matter? \n\t- This ambiguity is another thing we see echoed in the relationship between the Tlic and the Terrans as well, a pact that is as uncomfortable as it is workable--which, indeed, probably describes many more relationships than we'd like to admit.\n- **Sir Ron's Note:**\n\t- What the T'lic do (i.e. depositing their eggs into other organisms) is a common behavior in many insect species, particularly wasps. These are¬†**parasitoids**. \n\t- Female wasps use an extension of their abdomen called (just like in the story) the¬†**ovipositor**¬†to inject their eggs into aphids and bugs and other insects, all unsuspecting because the process tends to involve an anesthetic. \n\t- By the time the insects realize that they've been serving as living incubators, it's too late; when the eggs hatch, the larvae literally eat their way out of the host's body, killing it. The similarities with T'lic behavior are uncanny but likely not coincidental.\n\n**Discussion¬†Points**\n1.  How does \"Bloodchild\" display cognition and estrangement/defamiliarization when it comes to patriarchal society and/or relationships informed by patriarchy?\n2.  Why do you think the Tlic are designed the way they are?\n3.  Discuss the relationship between the Terrans and the Tlic. Do you think it's fair? Do you think it's equitable? Do you think it's just?\n4.  Would you call this a love story? Why or why not?\n5.  Use¬†the dichotomous key in Module 2¬†to try to classify the Tlic using Earth-based systems.\n\n#### Creature Spotlight: The Moclans\n- Continuing our apparent subtheme of Dudes Who Give Birth, let's turn our attention now to the episode of¬†_The Orville_¬†titled \"Sanctuary.\"¬†_The Orville_¬†is a dramedy science fiction show created by and starring (in live-action!) Seth MacFarlane, who in this show proves that he's way more than just the¬†_Family Guy_¬†guy. Together, MacFarlane as Captain Ed Mercer and a competent, diverse, weird-as-hell ensemble crew fly the USS Orville on behalf of the Planetary Union, in a show that began as \"the¬†_Family Guy_¬†guy tries to ape¬†_Star Trek_\" but by its second season develops into a series that builds on a lot of the nuance, heart, and spirit of shows like¬†_Star Trek: The Next Generation_. (You can see why we'd want to give this to you after \"The Chase.\")\n- The episode titled \"Sanctuary\" focuses on the Moclans, an overwhelmingly uni-gendered and homosexual species represented on the Orville by Lieutenant Commander Bortus, his husband Klyden, and their son Topa, who came out of a very large egg that Bortus laid in season 1. The earlier episode in which Topa hatched, \"About A Girl,\" revealed that Topa was originally female, something thought incredibly unlikely and aberrant to the greater bulk of Moclan society, and \"About A Girl\" focused on whether or not the child should undergo a \"corrective\" procedure to become--and thus be raised--male. Notably, the procedure went through, despite Bortus' eventual disapproval and desire to raise his child the way they were born (an early hint that¬†_The Orville_¬†was going to be more than fart jokes in space), a desire which brought him into conflict with his more conservative husband, Klyden, and set up one of the oft-repeated moral lessons of the show: Klyden is a huge jerk.\n- Then we get to \"Sanctuary,\" an episode that builds on and expands the themes of \"About A Girl,\" and¬†_oh boy._¬†This episode offers answers and questions alike about Moclan society, explores what happens when culture, history, realpolitik, the music of Dolly Parton, and the stubborn desire to make a better world all collide into each other, and shows that any historical reckoning with oppression is likely to be as messy as it is necessary (as well as reaffirming that, yes, Klyden is a huge jerk), while still being pretty funny and offering a surprising amount of heart and emotion when you least expect it.\n- The crux of \"Sanctuary\": Topa isn't alone, and female Moclan births are far, far more common than most Moclans know, a fact that Moclan society desperately tries to cover up. The titular sanctuary refers to a hidden planet which has become a base of operations for a rebel group of female Moclans run by Heveena, a once-revered Moclan poet and scholar who was revealed in \"About A Girl\" to also be female. While many Moclans who find that their children are hatched as females do opt for the \"corrective\" surgery, as Klyden advocated, it turns out that many others instead bring their children to this sanctuary world where they can be raised the way they are. The discovery of this world sets off a chain of events that implicates Moclus, the rebel colony, the Planetary Union, and the entire crew of the Orville as they find themselves balancing the female Moclans' right and desire to exist as they are against the conservative bigotry of the Moclans, who themselves play an important role in galactic politics and whose disfavor might imperil the Union.\n- The Moclans reflect an interesting estrangement of traditional norms around sex and gender in a different way from \"Bloodchild\": where that story presented an implicit role reversal, \"Sanctuary\" shows ==a forced attempt at erasing one gender completely, and the consequences of that for both sides of the equation.== Most Moclans are homosexual but also extremely bigoted, a combination that shows the very natural result of a conservative society in which they believe in only two genders,¬†_normal_¬†and¬†_female_. To further complicate matters, while \"mainstream\" Moclans self-identify as male, use male pronouns, and are treated by their fellow Union species as male, a biological reading suggests that according to our standards, male Moclans are probably technically female--but then, if mainstream Moclans think of themselves as male, and if all of galactic society sees them as male, and if even the members of the other sex whom they have tried to erase think of them as male and themselves as female, then does it even matter? ==The Moclans, having built a society that strictly reinforces the link between sex and gender¬†_within_¬†the world of the text, are also, paradoxically, a¬†_novum_¬†that completely subverts that link when it comes to our own¬†_reading_¬†of the text.==\n- (This also raises the question of whether male Moclans might be parthenogenetic, like deep-voiced dudebro whiptail lizards, as homosexual Moclan couples are fully capable of having offspring, or whether their sexual reproduction just works differently. This then leads to a further question: can Moclan¬†_women_¬†conceive, and if so, with which sex do they need to mate for that to happen? Or does it not actually matter? Worth speculating.)\n- **Sir Ron's Note:**\n\t- Moclan reproduction is really intriguing, if only because it's really difficult to understand it from an Earth perspective because is no known species of Earth life where the male's are parthenogenetic! This might a case of the writers wanting to make a statement on sex and gender and not really caring too much about the science of it. But I like Andy Weir's (writer of¬†_The Martian_) theory on it: that the intersex condition, once not too common (but still more common in Moclans than in humans), was favored over time because they have gametes that can be fertilized and they can produce eggs, and so the genes for the intersex condition became more common over time! The science still isn't exactly sound, but it's the best explanation that I've heard.\n\t- _The Orville_, in the way it has developed and used the Moclans, gives us a great example of how a seemingly simple¬†_novum_--a sapient, supposedly all-male species--can be, as Suvin says, ==\"developed with totalizing rigor,\" such that all the social implications make for a wealth of interesting complexities, contradictions, and stories.== And the Moclans themselves show us the ==dangers of a society founded on the idea of overbearing conformity to any identity and the subsequent marginalization and erasure of all others.== But most of all, they show us how ==these ideals that we assume to be unshakable are often in fact constructed and arbitrary, and how sometimes all it takes is sustained, thorough examination and inquiry==--perhaps with a little help from a song--to imagine something different.\n\n**Discussion Questions**\n1.  Explore the ways in which Moclan culture displays cognition and estrangement in relation to the traditional gender binary.\n2.  Discuss the Planetary Union's compromise at the end of the episode. What factors are they weighing, what does their proposed solution achieve, and could there have been a better one?¬†\n3.  Talk about the Dolly Parton reference. What was it doing there, what significance does it have, and did it make you feel feelings?\n4.  Fellas, is it [Moclan society] gay?\n\n#### \"Coming of Age in Karhide\": It's Kemmer Time\n- \"Coming of Age in Karhide\" is a deceptively simple story about Sov Thade Tage em Ereb, a fourteen-year-old Gethenian about to undergo their first kemmer. Kemmering is the¬†_novum_¬†at the heart of the story; it's the monthly process in which most Gethenians become fertile and express a particular gender (not always the same one each time, for most of them) for a short period, similar to the estrous cycle of female dogs and cats.\n\t- The kemmer cycle and its implications inform many parts of Gethenian society--from their family structures and social mores to the literal structures they build around it, such as the Fastness and the iconic kemmerhouse--and one's first kemmer, in particular, is seen as a significant moment, a moment of celebration and transition into adulthood.\n- This is the central conflict of the story: Sov's first kemmer, but more importantly, them dealing with their anxieties around kemmering (as well as the physical symptoms, of course). It's a small, domestic story, but one that explains a lot about the Gethenians' culture, which I think is by design. \n\t- A coming-of-age story, as we previously talked about, is anchored primarily on gaining maturity and losing innocence, but that need not always be as fraught a loss as Gan's in \"Bloodchild\"--here, innocence also takes the form of the childhood fears that Sov holds about kemmering and the stories that they, Sether, and their peers have heard. \n\t- But as Sov goes through the story and experiences their first kemmer, they find that kemmer is not something to be feared, but something natural and even beautiful, and the story is their way of sharing that beauty with their audience.\n- This is also ==a story about language==; it's a story that very much calls attention to the fact that it¬†_is_¬†a story being told by someone. There's a key paragraph on the second page that goes:\n\u003e \"I have already had some trouble trying to tell this story in a language that has no somer pronouns, only gendered pronouns. In their last years of kemmer, as the hormone balance chances, many people tend to go into kemmer as men; Dory's kemmers had been male for over a year, so I'll call Dory \"he,\" although of course the point was that he would never be either he or she again.\"\n- This one paragraph accomplishes many things. It reminds us that Sov is narrating this in a language that isn't theirs; this is something being translated for our benefit. \n\t- It reminds us that the human-centric default is something to which Sov is actively adjusting for the sake of telling us this story, and that ==our experience and language not universal and cannot be expected to be universal.== \n\t- This emphasis on the story being something Sov is actively telling in a language other than their own also further reinforces its status as something intended, in-universe, for human consumption, as a way of introducing them (and us) to Karhide society.\n\t- (It's also worth noting that Sov is technically incorrect about English not having somer pronouns, as I think¬†[neopronouns](https://intercultural.uncg.edu/wp-content/uploads/Neopronouns-Explained-UNCG-Intercultural-Engagement.pdf)such as xe and zie, as well as the singular \"they,\" would probably qualify. In-universe, this can probably be explained by Sov not having met any humans who use these pronouns; out-of-universe, we have to remember that Le Guin published this story in 1995, when awareness of neopronouns and the singular \"they\" hadn't entered public discourse as much as it has today.)\n- The world of Gethen--and, particularly, Gethenian biology and societies--is Ursula Le Guin's ==response to the feminist movement and the conversations it raised about sex and gender.== \n\t- Le Guin attempts to explore sex and gender by positing a world that actively upends traditional notions of both; Gethenian culture does not link sex and gender nearly as intrinsically as we often do--gender is largely seen as a phase rather than an identity, and the majority of Gethenians have the same biological sex, as we understand the concept. \n\t- This is also reflected in the language used--while there is still no singular \"they\" in the text, there is a very deliberate deployment of \"he\" and \"she,\" used only for Gethenians when they've kemmered as a particular sex (or halfdeads locked into one sex or the other), and never otherwise.\n- While on some level Karhide may seem like a gender utopia, it's also interesting to see the ways in which taboos and prejudice are treated here. \n\t- It's mentioned briefly towards the end that the desire to avoid having children with biological relatives is a \"modern scruple,\" something that sets Sov and Sether apart from their older relatives. \n\t- The generation gap is also mentioned earlier, when Sov speaks of the stigma around the halfdeads, the rare Gethenians who are permanently in kemmer and born locked into one sex or the other, viewed by older Gethenians not only as deviants but as perverts.\n- Karhide offers us a vision of a society that thinks about gender in such a different way than much of the world does, and in so doing it reminds us that ==different perspectives are not only possible but already exist, and existed long before this story came out.== \n\t- (I'm sure trans people and nonbinary people will have very different experiences of this text than cis readers, for instance, as would Native American readers from communities that recognize two-spirit people.) \n\t- Le Guin, to our knowledge, is a cisgender woman, and that perspective probably colors her handling of the text--the exploration is, by her own admission, kind of messy and more than a little flawed--but the work is still a great contribution to science fiction that explores ideas of identity, sex, and gender. And in a world where we are finally having these long-overdue conversations--perhaps even finally coming of age--I think that's a pretty great thing.\n- **Sir Ron's Notes:**\n\t- In many ways, the Gethenian kemmer resembles the¬†**estrous cycle**. Many mammals (including dogs and rodents) exhibit this type of reproductive behavior, where ==they are sexually receptive only at certain times of the year (largely hormonally determined).== \n\t- This is unlike the¬†**menstrual cycle**¬†of humans and several other mammals, which are sexually receptive at any time. In fact, the physiological and behavior changes that kemmer triggers are very similar to estrus (colloquially know as being \"in heat\"), as seen in these paragraphs:\n\n\u003e \"I was sick. My back ached all the time. My head ached and got dizzy and heavy‚Ä¶ Tiny needles of agony shot through my nipples, hot as fire‚Ä¶ My clitopenis was swollen hugely and stuck out from between my labia‚Ä¶ My labia itched and reddened as with loathsome insect bites.\"\n\u003e \n\u003e \"To get jerked around like that by your own body, to lose control‚Ä¶ Of being just a sex machine. And everybody just turns into something to have sex with. You know that people in kemmer go crazy and die if there isn‚Äôt anybody else in kemmer?\"\n\n- The latter paragraph describes the sexual urge that seizes estrous animals during periods of sexual receptiveness. ==It is a compulsion.==\n\t- Anyone who has had an intact (i.e. unspayed) male dog would know this. And as anyone who has had a female dog would know, failure of an intact one to mate within its lifetime can lead to a serious medical condition called¬†**pyometra**, which is a disease in the uterus.\n- The appearance of a clitopenis and a labia, as well as the alternation of roles during kemmer, clearly shows that Gethenians are¬†**monoecious**¬†organisms, or functional¬†**hermaphrodites**¬†that are functional both as males and females, if we define such based on their gonads and reproductive organs and their ability to produce both eggs and sperm. \n\t- The term hermaphrodite has historically been used to describe humans that deviate from expected anatomical characteristics of males and females, or having anatomical characteristics of both sexes, but it has come to be a loaded term that has led to stigmatization. \n\t- The preference in recent years has shifted to calling humans with these conditions (which come in many forms, several of them involving chromosomes)¬†**intersex**. No intersex individual has been known to be able to produce both male and female gametes, so the term hermaphrodite as it is used on non-human animals is not appropriate even from a biological perspective. \n\t- Based on how they are described in the story (and the brilliant novel¬†_The Left Hand of Darkness_, which is set in the same world), Gethenians are true hermaphrodites. Specifically, they are¬†**simultaneous hermaphrodites**, which are born with both gonads already functional, unlike s**equential hermaphrodites**, which change in sex later in their life, like clownfish. Regardless of its biological bases, \"Coming of Age in Karhide\" certainly invites us to rethink our norms in assigning sex roles, making it a very timely work of literature.\n\n**Discussion Points**\n1.  What did you think of Sov as a character? How did you respond to them as a protagonist?\n2.  Which parts of Gethenian society did you find interesting? What parts of it do you wish we could have seen more of?\n3.  In what ways do you think \"Coming of Age in Karhide\" succeeds as an exploration of ideas around identity, sex, and gender? In what ways do you think it fails?\n\n#### The Unruly Body: Disease and Parasitism\n\u003e _**\"If we cannot rely on our own bodies then on what can we rely?\"**_\n**-Andrew Tudor (1995)**\n\n- Sickness and wasting away of the body due to disease and parasitism as body horror is very well captured by these words from Andrew Tudor in his paper \"Unruly Bodies, Unquiet Minds\" in the first volume of¬†_Body and Society_. \n\t- When we are sick, or to be more specific, when we have something inside our bodies that is threatening our normal bodily functions, it is ==as if we are losing control of our bodies==, and that is horrifying. This is why disease and parasitism are very common tropes in science fiction and horror and works that hybridize this genre. \n\t- An outbreak of such a condition, where the pathogen or parasite strikes a greater number of people than expected, is the horrifying element at its most horrific. On top of ceding control of our bodies to invisible alien elements, the threat is now on the ==level that threatens the very fabric of society.== We can all understand what this means, all too sadly.\n\n##### Disease and Parasitism: Basic Definitions and Common Threads\n- Disease and parasitism are often discussed together because they work in very similar ways. In fact, scientists often use the same models to understand them.¬† \n- **Disease**¬†is a ==state of sickness or abnormal bodily condition== caused by a¬†**pathogen**(the causative agent), usually but not always biological. \n\t- Examples of common biological pathogens are bacteria, viruses, protozoans (unicellular eukaryotes), and fungi. The effects of disease are an interplay among three factors: the pathogen, the host, and the environment. This is why environmental sanitation and health are very important when dealing with a disease. \n\t- The study of the distribution and determinants of disease in organisms and of the subsequent control of these health problems is called¬†**epidemiology**.\n- On the other hand,¬†**parasitism**¬†is an ==ecological relationship== wherein one (or several) organism invades the body of another and lives off it for nutrients. \n\t- This is not the same as predation because parasites would typically live for an extended period of time on (if it's an¬†**ectoparasite**¬†like a tick) or in (if it's an¬†**endoparasite**¬†like a tapeworm) its host. Therefore, ==it would benefit the parasite to not kill its host outright.== \n\t- Typical human parasites are other animals, particularly arthropods (ticks and fleas) and various worms (tapeworms, flukes, roundworms, etc.). They can be quite bizarre. Many of them have complex life stages where they can undergo both asexual and sexual reproduction, in a transient¬†**intermediate host**¬†and a more long-term¬†**primary/definitive host**. For example, the flatworms called flukes, which usually infect the liver and the digestive system, can use freshwater snails as an intermediate host where they will reproduce asexually to produce many offspring, which will then penetrate the skin of an unsuspecting human bather who will serve as a primary host and an incubator of offspring produced through sexual reproduction. Many parasites can stay metabolically inert and dormant for a long time outside of the host in a tough state called a¬†**cyst**. Parasites often look bizarre, too, because of such modifications as hooks¬† and suckers. \n- Disease and parasitism are usually modelled using the equation¬†**R0¬†= NBL**, where:\n\t- _R0¬†= number of infected hosts over time;_\n\t- _N = number of susceptible hosts in the population;_\n\t- _B = transmission rate of disease/pathogen;_\n\t- _L = average period over which the host remains infectious_\n- This essentially means that ==an increase in any of these values will also increase R0, the reproductive number, which is usually how the virulence of a disease is reported.== An R0¬†value of greater than 1 means that the disease will spread. \n\t- If for example a disease's R0¬†is 15, then that means that one person can infect 15 people. A¬†[July article in the¬†_Emerging Infectious Diseases_¬†journal](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/7/20-0282_article)¬†reported a median R0¬†value of 5.7 for COVID-19.\n\t- The current value differs from place to place. For example, the most recent reports from the UK state the value as ranging from 0.8 to 1. \n\t- Science fiction diseases, particularly those figuring in outbreaks, usually play around with the reproductive number and its overall virulence.\n\n##### Outbreaks: Sci-fi's World Killers\n- When cases of disease go beyond what is expected for a given community, geographical area, or season, there is an¬†**outbreak or epidemic**. When the disease starts penetrating geographical boundaries, particularly when it spreads to other countries, the epidemiological community usually calls it a¬†**pandemic**. \n\t- The world has seen many epidemics and pandemics such as smallpox, Spanish flu, Black Death, malaria, TB, cholera, yellow fever, typhus, and polio. The Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is one of the most important in current times. The Black Death, commonly referred to as the plague, killed 75-200 million people (30-60% of the European population) in the 14th century. It was caused by the bacterium¬†_Yersinia pestis_¬†in fleas on black rats. Smallpox, caused by the¬†_Variola_¬†virus, caused 400,000 deaths in Europe in the 18th century and 400-500 millions deaths by the 20th century, with a death rate of 20-60% (80% in children). Thankfully, smallpox was virtually eradicated in 1979. The Spanish Flu epidemic of 1918, caused by the H1N1 virus mutated from birds and pigs (thus making it a¬†**zoonotic**¬†disease, one that spreads from other animals to humans), infected 500 million people and killed 50-100 million in two years.¬† COVID-19 is nowhere near as virulent as any of these, though we also have modern medicine to thank for that.\n- Predictably, sci-fi and horror authors love using pandemics. Stephen King's¬†_The Stand_¬†is a prime example in the horror genre. The Captain Trips virus is likely the deadliest in fiction; it exterminates 99.4% of the human population. Michael Crichton's¬†_Andromeda Strain_¬†is a completely alien pathogen, a virus-like entity that has no DNA, RNA, or amino acids. Interesting, many sci-fi works have used a disease to negatively affect human reproduction. In the comic book series¬†_Y: The Last Man_¬†by Brian K. Vaughan and Pia Guerra, an unidentified disease kills virtually all mammals with a Y chromosome. Raccoona Sheldon's \"The Screwfly Solution\" is an alien invasion story by way of murder and reproductive failure; the aliens release a pathogen that drives men to kill women (quick biological note: it likely affects the frontal lobe, which mediates social behaviors). And of course, we have Alfonso Cuaron's¬†_Children of Men_, one of the finest films ever made in any genre, an unknown condition has made females infertile or incapable of producing offspring.\n\n##### Mind-Controlling Parasites\n- In the amazing short story \"The Only Neat Thing to Do\" by James Tiptree, Jr. (who happens to be the same person as Raccoona Sheldon; her real name is Alice Sheldon), the intrepid young space adventurer Coati Cass encounters and becomes the unwitting host to an intelligent but equally naive microbe, Syllobene, who nestles in her brain and uses her own vocal cords and mouth to talk. It's a sweet coming of age and friendship tale that is nevertheless shadowed by the logical biological diagnosis that Syl satisfies all the criteria for an endoparasite. By her own admission, her species forms spores that are inert (i.e. cysts) outside of a host. She's feeding off the nutrients in Coati's blood and brain (even if she'd rather not be, the sweet thing!). And she has control over some of Coati's motor and behavioral functions. Yikes.\n- It's not really mind control, but many Earth parasites¬†_do_¬†have the ability to affect and drive their hosts' behaviors in a way that would be advantageous to the parasite. \n\t- For example, the bacterium¬†_Toxoplasma gondii_¬†hitches a ride in rats and makes them less afraid of the smell of cat urine, thereby increases the likelihood of the rat being eaten by a cat, which just happens to be¬†_T. gondii_'s preferred host! \n\t- The worm¬†_Euhaplorchis__californiensis_¬†infects fish and makes them go up to the surface of the water and shimmy, so that the fish attracts a predatory shorebird. As you may have guessed, the shorebird is¬†_E. californiensis_'s preferred host.\n\t- And of course, we have the¬†_Cordyceps_¬†fungus made insanely popular by the video game series¬†_The Last of Us_¬†(the¬†_Cordyceps_¬†overlords thank thee!), which in their original, real-life ant hosts compel the ant to seek out the fungus's optimal growth conditions, usually high up in a tree, before bursting like a chestburster from the poor insect. \n\t- Such amazing parasites do all of this by high-jacking, co-opting, and manipulating their hosts' nerve impulses and¬†**neurotransmitters**, which are the ==hormones produced by our nervous system that regulate our behaviors.== Examples of neurotransmitters are dopamine, adrenaline, oxytocin, gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), and endorphins. You can imagine how rich a source of inspiration this could be for sci-fi/horror authors.\n\n##### And Finally, Zombies\n- I've argued in my paper¬†_Mutations and Metamorphoses: Body Horror is Biology Horror_¬†that ==zombies are the ultimate in bodily abjection; there is complete loss of control of bodily functions, including and especially reproduction, and thus essentially an end in evolutionary tendencies.== \n\t- Zombies in the true sense of being animated corpses are not alive, with non-functioning brains and hearts, and so they should not be able to move on their own. \n\t- Supernatural causes such as dark rituals (pop culture depictions of voodoo), necromancy¬†(*Dungeons and Dragons*¬†and many other fantasy works), and demonic possession (_The Evil Dead_,¬†_[REC]_) need not bother about the biological explanations. Sci-fi, however, does, and in this genre, the common culprits are radiation (the George Romero films, presumably), viruses (_28 Days Later_,¬†_The Walking Dead_) or other biological agents (_The Last of Us_), and¬†**prions**, which are mutated proteins like the ones that cause mad cow disease and Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD). This has proven to be quite attractive an explanation because of ==the association of prions with kuru, a disease caused by prions in the brain and spread by the cannibalistic practice of eating the brains of the dead in some indigenous New Guinea communities.== Also, prion diseases are ==neurodegenerative; they cause loss of balance, disrupted coordination, blindness, dementia, and sleep disorders.== Sound familiar?\n- The beautifully romantic and bittersweet story \"Love Will Tear Us Apart\" by Alaya Dawn Johnson uses prions to explain the zombification of Philip Grayson. Interestingly, it also explains his lack of compunction to kill by saying that the prion has eaten away a good part of his ==frontal lobe, one of the many functions of which is to mediate human behavior according to social norms==; we behave in accordance with what society deems to be good behavior because of our frontal lobe. In Gene Wolfe's¬†_Book of the Dying Sun_¬†(I don't know what else I need to tell you to convince you to read them!), certain humans in far-future Urth (Earth?) have elected to have their frontal lobes removed so as to remove all emotional and social obligations to fellow humans.\n- That Johnson focuses so much on the brain is critical. Any attempt to scientifically explain a zombie would have to account for how it is moving on its own (unless some endoparasite like¬†_Cordyceps_¬†is controlling the body), and ==only the brain functioning even at a very low level would explain that.== Typical zombie characteristics can be easily matched with damage or disorder in particular parts of the brain, such as slurred speech (speech centers in the cerebrum), rattling breath and moaning (medulla oblongata), and the slow, jerky, shambling motion (motor cortex and cerebellum).\n\n**Points for Discussion**\n1. Do you consider¬†_Contagion_¬†to be science fiction? Why or why not?\n2. In what ways can a pathogen or an element of it be a¬†_novum_?\n3. From both literary and biological perspectives, why do a lot of dystopian or apocalyptic sci-fi target human reproduction with their diseases or parasites?\n4. What¬†_novum_¬†in zombie literature do you find most interesting? Why?\n\n#### \"Love Will Tear Us Apart\": Warmer Bodies\n- Our next text for this module is \"Love Will Tear Us Apart\" by Alaya Dawn Johnson, a short story about a zombie who meets a boy whom he finds himself wanting to eat in, ah, more ways than one. We thought this was an appropriate text with which to begin to wrap up this module for a few reasons: because it invokes ideas of both sex and pathogens, identity and infection; because it's dark and cute and funny in a way that we think you all might really enjoy; because it would be irresponsible to let a course focused on biology and science fiction end without talking about zombies.\n- The zombie is a classic monster with roots that go as far back as 1819 Brazil (with the word's roots seemingly being African), but its current form owes just as much to the tradition of undead-focused horror of the 20th century. The closest we've come so far in this class to providing a reasonably comprehensive definition of zombies is¬†**\"undead or sick humans characterized by physical resilience, impaired or absent mental faculties, and a hunger for the flesh of non-zombies.\"**¬†While the early Haitian zombie was most often seen as a single undead being (a tradition echoed by works like H. P. Lovecraft's writing and even more recent texts like Stephen King's¬†_Pet Sematery_), Oscar Romero's¬†_Night of the Living Dead_¬†cemented two ideas in popular consciousness: the image of the zombie horde, and the associative link between zombies and capitalism.\n- Where the vampire is most popularly portrayed as a creature of¬†_desire_, the zombie is a creature of¬†_hunger_, and this is a really interesting difference to explore. ==Vampires are characterized by control--domination and seduction--while zombies more exemplify the loss of it, the erosion of higher faculties by a force (usually a curse or a virus, or, as in this story, a prion) that replaces them with animalistic cravings and needs.== Our fear of the zombie is often described as ==a hyperbolized fear of the other==--a fear of the crowd, the belief that other people fundamentally cannot be reasoned with and are out to get you--but the¬†_experience_¬†of the zombie is ultimately ==a defamiliarized version of being slave to wants and needs imposed on us by an external force.==\n- Philip is a zombie in a world that has more or less gotten used to living with zombies.¬†(How unrealistic, a world in which we learn to live with a terrifying disease instead of curing it.)Unlike \"Bloodchild,\" whose status as a love story is tentative and a little ambiguous at best, Philip's story with Jack is very much a romance, passionate and fierce and kind of sexy and wholly consensual despite one of them being, essentially, undead. Desire in all its complexity is very much a driving force behind this narrative: the second paragraph of the story, where Philip reflects on his attraction to Jack, goes thusly-\n\u003e And what if he‚ÄîI mean ‚Äúit‚Äù‚Äîwere really hot? Tall and lanky and weirdly well muscled, with bright blue eyes and ginger hair? So, he smells like the best meal you‚Äôve ever eaten, but you kind of want to bone him too. Can‚Äôt have it both ways. You aren‚Äôt a necro. But a boy‚Äôs got to eat‚Äîmaybe you could just nibble a bit at the edges? A part he won‚Äôt miss, and then fuck the rest of him. Eat an arm or something. He can still fuck with one arm. Not that well, though. Probably wouldn‚Äôt like it. Okay, a hand. Who ever needed a left hand? Then you remember that Jack‚Äîthat‚Äôs his name, the mac and cheese‚Äîplays lacrosse. That‚Äôs probably where he got all those yummy muscles. You need two hands for lacrosse.\n- Philip's attraction to Jack is multi-layered: physical, emotional, aesthetic, and carnal, in the hungry-zombie sense of the word as well as the sexual sense. For Philip, it seems, desire and literal hunger are tangled together in a way that we as readers may find unusual (especially if we're students in a science fiction class who have just been told that ==zombies usually signify hunger¬†_as opposed to_¬†desire, lower-order wanting as opposed to higher-order yearning==). Here we see that Johnson's story is almost a response to traditional zombie fiction, a subversive shift in what the zombie¬†_novum_¬†signifies: here, ==being a zombie is almost a metaphor for queerness==, a state of being and desiring that is seen as deviant, unnatural, and other, tolerated but not embraced, kept at the margins for fear that it might \"infect\" \"the rest of us.\"\n- The thing is, this is a scenario that shows both ==the power and the limitations of¬†_nova_¬†as metaphors==: whether or not we read Philip's zombie state as a metaphor for queerness, he is also¬†_literally a zombie_. And, much like with mutants and the mutant metaphor, we can't assume 1-to-1 correspondence between the signifier and the signified at all times, because otherwise you get into rather unfortunate implications, given that untreated zombies are dangerous, brain-rotted man-eaters. While Philip's zombification is very much tied up with queerness in this text in terms of how both play upon his body and the manner in which he desires, we can't then use this to say that being a zombie is exactly like being gay, or, worse, that being gay is just like being a zombie. Even in the world of the text, being a zombie means being a victim of a disease which eats away at parts of your brain, seems to impair your ability to regulate your actions, and, oh yeah, makes you want to eat people, whereas contrary to what your overly conservative relatives might say, being gay is not comparable to that¬†_at all_. ==In this case especially, signifier and signified merely align; they are not one and the same.==\n- And speaking of overly conservative relatives--let's talk for a bit about Jack's father, the Ice Man. On the face of it, the Ice Man isn't literally a homophobic dad standing in the way of his son's relationship because it's gay. He is, in fact, a zombie killer, one who's training his son to follow in his footsteps; in any other work, we might be rooting for this guy. But given what we know of Philip and his relationship with Jack, as well as our knowledge of the setting as a world in which some zombies have in fact successfully reintegrated into society, the Ice Man functionally plays the disapproving father role in the text to a T: committed to a worldview that brands certain types of people as monstrous and other, and refusing to broaden or change it even when presented with evidence to the contrary. The difference here is that just as queerness is entangled with zombification in the text, so too is the homophobic father trope mingled with the monster slayer image, which makes the stakes for this relationship dangerous on a much more literal level. The way in which Philip and the narrative confront and resolve this danger--the forces arrayed against the relationship as crystallized into the character of the Ice Man, to say nothing of the decisions faced by Jack--perfectly encapsulate what the relationship must go through, and (without spoiling anything) truly make the ending of the text earned, in every way that matters.\n\n**Discussion Points**\n1.  In the text, Philip's internal narration frequently compares Jack to mac and cheese. How do you read the fact that he's comparing the guy he likes to food? (Bonus: Why do you think mac and cheese specifically is the food in question?)\n2.  Both love stories and horror stories are ultimately about encounters with the other. Compare and contrast how the other behaves in a love story vis-a-vis how it behaves in a horror story.\n3.  Considering how the story ends, the final image on which the text ends is a strangely dissonant one. Why do you think that's the image we're left with?\n4.

Then you will explore 3 different philosophies and reflect on the decisions and actions that they might influence in educational settings._\n\n#### The 3 Big Words of Philosophy\n- **What is education philosophy for?** One of the best ways to really dig deep into this question is to unpack what it is. \n- Here's a short excerpt from an article from Oregeon State University¬†([https://oregonstate.edu/instruct/ed416/PP1.html](https://oregonstate.edu/instruct/ed416/PP1.html)). While reading the excerpt below, be aware of your \"head nod moments\" - or parts where you find yourself agreeing - since most probably you have the same views, or your \"head shaking moments\" - or parts that go against your current beliefs or views.\n\n\u003e Philosophy means \"love of wisdom.\" It is made up of two Greek words,¬†philo, meaning love, and¬†sophos, meaning wisdom. Philosophy helps teachers to reflect on key issues and concepts in education, usually through such questions as: What is being educated? What is the good life? What is knowledge? What is the nature of learning? And What is teaching? Philosophers think about the ==meaning of things== and ==interpretation of that meaning.== Even simple statements, such as \"What should be learned? Or What is adolescence?\" set up raging debates that can have major implications. For example, what happens if an adolescent commits a serious crime? One interpretation may hide another. If such a young person is treated as an adult criminal, what does it say about justice, childhood, and the like? Or if the adolescent is treated as a child, what does it say about society's views on crime?\n\u003e \n\u003e Your educational philosophy is ==your belief about why, what and how you teach, whom you teach, and about the nature of learning.== It is a set of principles that guides professional action through the events and issues teachers face daily. Sources for your educational philosophy are your life experiences, your values, the environment in which you live, interactions with others and awareness of philosophical approaches. Learning about the branches of philosophy, philosophical world views, and different educational philosophies and theories will help you to determine and shape your own educational philosophy, combined with these other aspects.\n\u003e \n\u003e ==When you examine a philosophy different from your own, it helps you to \"wrestle\" with your own thinking.== Sometimes this means you may change your mind. Other times, it may strengthen your viewpoint; or, you may be¬†eclectic, selecting what seems best from different philosophies. But in eclecticism, there is a danger of sloppy and inconsistent thinking, especially if you borrow a bit of one philosophy and stir in some of another. If serious thought has gone into selection of strategies, theories, or philosophies, this is less problematic. For example, you may determine that you have to vary your approach depending on the particular learning needs and styles of a given student. At various time periods, one philosophical framework may become favored over another. For example, the Progressive movement led to quite different approaches in education in the 1930s. But there is always danger in one \"best or only\" philosophy. In a pluralistic society, a variety of views are needed.\n\n- I remember one of the first days from a class in my graduate studies class, where a teacher of mine asked us, \"Why do you want to learn about education philosophy?\" Of course, a lot of us, albeit already being teachers ourselves, were a bit dumbfounded, but I still remember how our teacher answered that question. She said, **\"We study philosophy and education, so that we can have a ==common language== and we can ==build on each other's ideas== in our profession\".** \n- This made a lot of sense - we study the history and philosophies of education because ==if we have this shared knowledge, we can begin to understand each other's perspectives and we can build on each other's ideas.== Hopefully throughout the course, you've felt like we've been doing some education ==\"vocabulary building\".==\n- Education Philosophies provide us with vocabulary to answer three fundamental questions:\n\t- **What is the nature of Reality (Metaphysics):** ==Often, ones perception about reality affects the aims, concerns and curriculum of a particular kind of education.==¬†Is reality mental or spiritual? Is it objective, existing outside our minds? Is it based on our experience?¬† Do we construct our own reality?¬†\n\t- **What is the nature of Knowledge? (Epistemology):** This second question is about one's belief about knowledge - is knowledge something discovered from reality? or from universal truths that we discover through thinking and discourse?¬†Is knowledge (truth) intuitive, subjective or personal? Is knowledge (truth) revealed from God in a sacred or holy book?¬† Is knowledge (truth) revealed from reasoning? Is knowledge (truth) empirical, constructed by using our sense and the scientific method?¬†==Often, our perspective about knowledge affects our methods of instruction.==¬†\n\t- **What is the nature of Values? (Axiology):** This third question is quite interesting, because it reminds us that when we look at education history, it's never just been about a transfer of knowledge and skills, but ultimately also about ==behavior and attitudes.== Recall how education in the historical era's we've covered aimed to form a certain kind of educated person. This third question¬†examines ==what is right and wrong; good and evil.==¬† Are the ethical standards of behavior, objective and universal?¬† Are ethics subjective? (personal likes and dislikes) Are ethics culturally relative, depending on cultural norms at a given time?\n- These three questions often form the building blocks of the \"isms\" or education philosophies we will study. Pause and think about your own answers to these three questions. Give yourself permission to be a Philosopher in the next few minutes of this module. \n\n#### Your 3 big words\n##### Prompt\nLet's begin the process of building towards your own teaching philosophy. Answer the 3 questions below:\n1. What is reality for you? Based on this, what is important to be learned?¬†(Metaphysics)\n2.  What do you believe about knowledge?¬†(Epistemology)\n3. What do you think are values and behavior that need to be taught to everyone?¬†(Axiology)\n\n##### Answer\n###### Outline\n- Metaphysics\n\t- [[Cards/Modernism]], [[Cards/Metamodernism]]\n\t- We construct our own reality...this is made more prevalent in the post-truth era\n- Epistemology\n\t- I believe that knowledge is empirical\n\t- But I also believe in an intuitive/personal perspective\n- Axiology\n\t- Morals are universal...for instance human dignity\n\t- But ethics? Can be subjective\n\n###### Writing\n\n**Metaphysics:** I like to perceive reality through the lens of metamodernism. Having developed from modernism (a maximalist and optimistic perspective, where people wanted to be godlike and make history) and postmodernism (a skeptical and disillusioned perspective, where people no longer believed in a universal reality), this philosophy spotlights plurality. We live in a complex world, which none of us are capable of understanding to the fullest. This can make us resort to reductionism; we can either ascribe to fundamentalism (rigidly adhering to a limited set of beliefs) or relativism (believing that objective truth doesn't exist, for it is always context-dependent). Metamodernists accept the complexity of life by allowing paradoxes to coexist. They believe that the world isn't so black and white, and more like a wide spectrum of gray; they also believe that these binaries crucially complement each other, enriching each other's perspectives (just like the Yin and Yang). So based on all this, I believe that it is important to cultivate critical thinking. This indicates not ony thinking critically about the world, but also ourselves ‚Äî what thinking traps do we often get caught in, and how can we prevent ourselves from falling into these in the future?\n\n**Epistemology:** In line with metamodernism, my take on knowledge is also paradoxical. While I believe that knowledge is empirical, I also believe that it is intuitive and subjective. For instance, I am both a STEM advocate and a believer in God and magic; to me, both natural and spiritual perspectives are needed in order to learn more about ourselves and the world. This belief also reflects in the roles I play in life. I work as a technologist, but I also consider myself an artist at heart. I value both the knowledge I get from my surroundings (like whenever I conduct user research or build with tools) and the knowledge I get from within myself (such as artistic intution); all of this makes me the creator I am today.\n\n**Axiology:** One value I believe everyone needs to learn is **empathy.** I believe that most conflicts that are going on in the world (from a personal to global scale) are caused by a lack of understanding we have for another. We tend to assume that others think just like us, forgetting that we all experience the world differently (due to factors like gender, sexuality, race, socioeconomic class, religion, etc.). But despite our differences, we all share universal moral principles: individual rights, freedom, equality, etc. Thus, I believe that we are capable of reaching shared understanding if we take the time to listen to one another. So in line with this, one behavior that I think should be cultivated in everyone is introspection. What are the beliefs underlying our actions and reactions in this world? What do these beliefs say about us? Having a greater self-awareness will help us not only understand ourselves, but also the others around us.\n\n**Sources:**\n- https://metamoderna.org/metamodernism/\n- https://nesslabs.com/metamodernism\n- https://open.maricopa.edu/culturepsychology/chapter/culture-and-morality/\n\n### [[Idealism]]\n#### The philosophy of [[Idealism]]\n- We'll begin with a philosophy that might sound familiar because you've already encountered it when you read about Education in Ancient Greece.\n- Spend a few moments recalling what comes to mind when you hear the term \"Idealism\" - maybe you've encountered it already in Philosophy class, or if you haven't just by reading the word, what are some guesses as to what is meant by this philosophy?\n\t- _It often helps to take note of the root word as an anchor to help you remember what the philosophy is all about. In this case, the obvious root word is \"idea\". The¬†**word idea comes from**¬†Greek ·º∞Œ¥Œ≠Œ±¬†**idea**which means\"form, pattern,\" from the root of ·º∞Œ¥Œµ·øñŒΩ idein, \"to see.\"._\n- Watch this [brief overview on Idealism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYV9BqnC4X4) by Dr. CJ Dubash from the Virtual University of Pakistan¬†_(approx. 5 minutes)._\n\t- [[Idealism]] believes that ideas are the only true reality, the only thing worth knowing\n\t- Its focus was on the mind\n\t- Originators were Plato and Socrates\n\t\t- Always returned questions, so that students were for ed to think\n\t\t- Think...is training or education happening in the classroom?\n\n Let's dig deeper by unpacking the 3 key questions:\n 1. **What is the nature of Reality (Metaphysics)?**\n\t 1. Plato is said to be the founder of Western Idealism. If you remember the article you read on Greek Education, in the latter Athenian Era, Philosophers like Socrates, Plato and Aristotle came into the picture, promoting intellectual discipline as an aim of education. \n\t 2. This aim was grounded on the perspective that **\"Ideas are the only permanent reality\"**.\n\t 3. One of the most commonly cited illustrations of this thinking is Plato's [[Allegory of the Cave]]. Watch this [short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWlUKJIMge4)  to remind you of this allegory. As you watch, try to uncover what is meant by the quote above.\n\t\t 1. Plato believed that philosophy was a kind of therapy for the soul\n\t\t 2. This story was intended to compare \"the effect of education and the lack of it in our nature\"\n\t\t 3. On the enlightned man: \"Previously he had been looking merely at phantoms; now he is nearer to the true nature of being.\" (a.k.a. being exposed to stars)\n\t\t 4. This story serves as an allegory of the life of all enlightened people\n\t\t\t 1. Cave dwellers: humans before philosophy\n\t\t\t 2. Sun: light of reason\n\t\t\t 3. Alienation of returned philosopher: what all truth tellers can expect when they try to teach people who have devoted their lives to not thinking\n\t\t5. In Plato's eyes, we are all for much of our lives in shadow. The things we strive for tend to be phantoms (e.g. fame, success)\n\t\t6. No one chooses to be in the cave. It's just where we happen to begin\n\t\t7. Solution: a process of widespread carefully administered philosophical education.\n\t\t\t1. Socratic method\n\t\t8. Confucius: \"Wisdom starts with admitting ignorance\"\n\t4. As you saw and heard about in the video, from the perspective of the Idealist, there are two worlds:\n\t\t1. **The Physical World**¬†(or what is sometimes referred to as the external world)¬†\n\t\t2. **The Spiritual World**¬†(or what is sometimes referred to as the internal world or the world of the intellect).\n\t5. **Think about that for a moment.**¬†Does this make sense to you?What comes to mind here is the movie: The Matrix (what your generation might already call one of the classic sci-fi films). In one of the movie's most famous scenes, Morpheus asks Neo to choose the blue pill or the red pill. Where taking one would keep him ignorant of the actual reality and the other opens his eyes to what is \"really\" real (like how in the allegory of the cave, one of the characters left the cave).\n\t6. In idealism, ==what is \"really\" real is the world of ideas==, and ==the material world that we encounter are mere \"shadows\".==\n\t\t1. _\"The main tenant of idealism is that ==ideas and knowledge are the truest reality.==¬† Many things in the world change, but ideas and knowledge are enduring.¬† Idealism was often referred to as ‚Äúidea-ism‚Äù. Idealists believe that ideas can change lives. The most important part of a person is the mind. It is to be nourished and developed.\"_\n\t7. **This means that the aim of education for idealism is the pursuit of the internal through reasoning:**¬†that through reason one can embark on the a search for truth, beauty, and justice that is enduring and everlasting. If you find yourself grappling with this idea, then that's great! That's exactly what idealists would want us to do.\n 2. **What is the nature of Knowledge? (Epistemology)**\n\t 1. Because of this view of reality, knowledge, for the idealist, is not something to be found from the external world, but rather should be ==rediscovered internally.==\n\t\t 1. \"In idealism, knowing is recognition or reminiscence of latent ideas that are performed in the mind...through intuition, introspection, and insight, ==the individual looks within his or her own mind and therein finds the absolute==\" (Gutek, 1997)\n\t 2. This means that in education, the teacher's aim is to ==help students grown into mental awareness==, recognizing that this ability is just a latent one that needs awakening. \n\t\t 1. A common manifestation of this belief in teaching is [the Socratic Method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1VcFggcLTY), that relies on uncovering truth through questions.\n\t 3. **This means that idealism in education**¬†is ultimately ==the pursuit of abstraction== - the ability to attain the highest intellect, for it is only with the use of such faculties that we can begin to \"see the light\".\n 3. **What is the nature of Values? What is good? (Axiology)**\n\t 1. Finally, in idealism, \"values are more than mere human preferences\" (Gutek, 2017), they are absolute. In particular, those of ==truth, beauty and justice==:\n\t 2. _For the Idealist, ==goodness is found in the ideal, that is, in perfection.== It is found on the immaterial level, that is, in the perfect concept, or notion, or idea, of something. Thus, perfect goodness is never to be found in the material world. Evil, for the Idealist, consists of the absence or distortion of the ideal. It is a breaking of the eternal law. Since ideals can never change (because they are static and absolute), moral imperatives concerning them do not admit of exceptions. That is, these imperatives are stated in terms of \"always\" or \"never.\" For example: \"Always tell the truth\" or (put negatively) \"Never tell a lie.\" Since truth is the knowledge of ideal reality and a lie is a distortion of that reality, truth must always be told and lying can never be justified. (Barger, 2001) source:¬†[https://www3.nd.edu/~rbarger/philblfs-with-epis.html](https://www3.nd.edu/~rbarger/philblfs-with-epis.html)_\n\t 3. Therefore,¬†**the educated person in idealism**¬†is someone who ==upholds these absolute values.==\n4.

I agree with the takeaways from Plato's Allegory of the Cave. Now that I'm in my early 20's, I can definitely attest to our tendency to pursue \"phantoms\", a.k.a. extrinsic motivators (e.g. money, fame, success); I too have fallen prey to these rewards. Thus, I can see the value of philosophy; in order to free ourselves of these chains, we need to go deep inside ourselves.\n2. I disagree with the binary nature of moral imperatives. The world we live in isn't so black-and-white; thus, I believe that the laws we learn aren't always applicable to every situation. For instance, there are cases where lying can be justified (e.g. you may not out a loved one with a marginalized sexuality in the interests of protecting their safety).\n3. What I find interesting about idealism is how it values cultivating individual agency. When Dr. CJ Dubash asked \"In the classroom, are you doing training or education?\", it really struck me, making me more conscious of the methods used to share knowledge. Teaches don't always have to treat knowledge as something to transfer; instead, they can guide students in drawing out this knowledge from themselves.\n\n#### [[Idealism]] in Education\n- In the previous activity, you learned about the Philosophy of Idealism. Here's a quick recap of some of the key ideas. In idealism...\n\t- the spiritual, conceptual, non-material world is the ultimate reality\n\t-   knowing (gaining knowledge) is the intuitive recall of ideas present in the mind\n\t-   follows the deductive thinking/reasoning\n\t-   values are universal, absolute, and eternal\n- Grounded, on these key ideas, how does this philosophy influence education? Let's imagine what an school that purely adheres to idealism might look like.\n-  ü•Ö¬†**Goal:** \n\t- The goal is for learners to be ==truth-seekers==, the truth in this case is to ==attain the eternal values of Goodness, Truth and Beauty==. It is for them to:\n\t\t- Realize their full potential, as inherent in human nature - which is to access the world of the mind through intellect\n\t\t- As a social institution, to learn from and contribute to wisdom\n\t- This goal opposes other perspectives about the aim of education, such consumerism, and vocationalism. In fact, Idealists have ==condemned materialism as an obstacle to a true vision of reality.==\n- üìö¬†**Curriculum:** \n\t- The idealist curriculum then, at its summit, has Philosophy and Theology at the top, since these courses entail a ==higher level of abstraction and intellectual thought==. The curriculum, should then be ==successive and cumulative==, arranged based on complexity, so as to prepare learners for this higher order thinking.¬†_Sounds familiar?_\n\t- Since the aim is to expand a learner's access to the world of the mind, the passing on of wisdom through subjects such as Art, History and Literature were also given importance.\n- üí¨¬†**Methodology:**\n\t- Since Idealism presupposes that learning is a process of reminiscence, it recognizes every learner's ==inherent ability to uncover the truth== (in their minds). Therefore, teaching and learning is often done through ==reflection== (recognition, introspective self-examination, self-activity). An ideal methodology being the Socractic Method (which you learned about in the previous activity).\n\t- One interesting fact is that, Froebel, the founder of the kindergarten was an idealist! He believed in the learner‚Äôs own self-activity - and we continue to see this in most kindergarten schools - there is a great sense of allowing the students to uncover things on their own.\n\t- For idealists, ==exposure to cultural heritage== is also an important part of the learning process, since this is where the ==wisdom of the past== can be learned.\n\t- Finally, the idealist teacher is recognized ‚ÄúAs a ==mature person==...one who has established a cultural perspective and has integrated various roles into a harmonious orchestration. While the learner is immature and seeks the perspective that the culture can provide‚Äù\n- To deepen your understanding further, read more from this¬†excerpt from Gutek, 2017.\n\n##### Think and Share\nIn 2018, this headline was highlighted by media, spotlighting the¬†Philippines' Ranking in the recent PISA study, which showed that we ranked lowest in reading, math and science.

How different is their perspective of reality and of knowledge? Watch this [brief overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sw25HjXRmU0) by Dr. CJ Dubash from the Virtual University of Pakistan.\n\t- According to [[Realism]], reality exists independent of the human mind. World of physical objects = ultimate reality.\n\t- Its focus was on the body\n\t\t- Seen in the disciplines of biology, chemistry, physics, sociology, psychology...\n\t- Originator: Aristotle\nLet's dig deeper by unpacking the 3 key questions:\n1. **What is the nature of Reality (Metaphysics)?**\n\t1. \"While Plato was concerned with an abstract world of perfect forms or ideas, Aristotle used ==common-sense observation== to investigate a public world of ==natural and social phenomena==\" (Gutek, 2017)\n\t2. As opposed to plato's views of reality, for Aristotle: **\"We live in an objective order of reality that exists independent of and external to our minds\"**\n\t3. This means that objects in the world exist, even if we have not experienced or thought of them yet. Unlike the views of the idealist that the spiritual world is real, and the material world is not, realists believed in a ==dualistic view of reality== - where mind and body are two components of reality.\n2. **What is the nature of Knowledge? (Epistemology)**\n\t1. Because of this view of reality, \"Knowing is to have knowledge about an object. Cognition or knowing, involves an ==interaction between the human mind and the world outside of the mind.==\" (Gutek 2017)¬†\n\t\t1. (Personal note: feels related to embodiment...my obsession with dance and learning)\n\t2. This assumes that knowing begins with ==sensation (encountering the world)==, and leads to ==abstraction (knowing about the world).== \n\t\t1. For example, we encounter a chair first, and are able to describe its shape, color texture etc, and this sensory data is sorted in our minds through conceptualization, where we form the concept of a \"chair\". \n\t\t2. If an idealist would ==look inward== to gain knowledge, the realist will seek to ==look outwards== to discover knowledge.\n\t3. Watch the [short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrQ442KEokk) that follows to further investigate the perspective of the realists, from the perspective of Aristotle.¬†_(Approx. 5 minutes)_¬†As you do, take note of quotes that you can connect with or those that challenge your thinking.\n\t\t1. [[Empiricism]]: knowledge is gained by sense experience of the mterial world\n\t\t2. [[Correspondence Theory of Truth]]\n\t\t\t1. When our understanding corresponds identically to an object, we have knowledge of it\n\t\t\t2. When it corresponds poorly, we only have an *opinion*\n\t\t3. Unlike Plato, Aristotle rejected rationalism as the basis of knowledge\n\t\t\t1. He believed that the changeable physical world could be an object of knoweldge\n\t\t\t2. He also rejected Plato's idea of rationalism being *innate* -- the idea that we have within us some truth that we gained through prior experience\n\t\t\t3. He then rejected the world of forms as superfluous because we don't need it as an explanation...we don't need to rely on reason to acquire knowledge\n\t\t\t4. Instead, he argued that we have an ==innate capacity to perceive==, and that ==everything you know comes from perception==\n\t\t4. Knowledge gained empirically (through sense experience) is called *a posteriori* knowledge\n\t\t5. Aristotle argued that even our most basic first principles come from experience. Things like mathematical and logical truths, and that includes as well our understanding of universals and abstract ideas like a perfect triangle\n\t\t6. One of Aristotle's most important observations about the physical world was that ==everything has a purpose== and theword for this is *[[Telos]]*\n\t\t\t1. Teology: study of purpose; Aristotle used this as a way of studying the world\n\t\t\t2. Examples:\n\t\t\t\t1. Walking about ‚Üí health\n\t\t\t\t2. Strategy ‚Üí victory\n\t\t\t\t3. Medical art ‚Üí health\n\t\t\t\t4. Shipbuilding ‚Üí vessel\n\t\t\t\t5. Economics ‚Üí wealth\n\t\t\t3. He believed that to know something fully, we need to understand its purpose and the purpose of a thing determines what that thing is like its nature or its essence. In other words, ==the why is finally reducible to the definition.==\n\t\t\t4. Aristotle argued that how effectively something fulfills its [[Telos]] determines its goodness. ==So the more effectively it fulfills its purpose, the better it is.==\n\t\t7. [[Induction]]: process of looking at specific examples to generalizing all examples. Going from a few specific observations, then assuming that all similar things will be like that.\n\t\t\t1. Observed As are B ‚Üí all As are B\n\t\t8. Aristotle argued that having a [[Telos]] doesn't imply a mind or an intention. So he's not saying that someone created all these natural things so that they had these purposes or ends. He's just observing that that is the way that things are. Everything does have an end, and that the end is what makes it truly itself.\n3. **What is the nature of Values? What is good? (Axiology)**\n\t1. _\"Realists encourage us to ==shape our values== in terms of the ==structures of reality.== By knowing the structures of physical, natural, social and human reality, we can frame realistic and viable alternatives. Through knowledge, we can rationally frame choices about life.\" (Gutel 2017)_\n\t2. Values, for realists are eternal and are based on Natural Law. Therefore, the value of something is based on its nature. ==Therefore, humans, to be true to our nature, should live up to our full potential as rational beings.==\n\t3. Contemporary realists such as Harry Broudy would say that the ultimate aim of education is to ==\"live the good life\"== - meaning, to reach one's human potential through self-determination, self-realization and self-integration.\n\n##### Think and Share\nTo help you process what you currently understand about Realism, we will use another visible thinking strategy called¬†**Step Inside: Perceive, Know about, Care about****. Imagine that you a realist educator teaching now in this time of the pandemic:\n1. How do you think you would see the situation (perceive)? What would they see as an opportunity or as a challenge?\n2. What do you think will a realist know that will come in handy in this situation?\n3. What do you think would a realist teacher care about the most?\n\n#### [[Realism]] in Education\nIn the previous activity, you learned about the Philosophy of realism. Here's a quick recap of some of the key ideas. In realism...\n-   reality is objective and exists independently of us but we can know it\n-  knowing consists of conceptualization based on sensation and abstraction\n-   values are absolute and eternal, based on universal natural laws\n\nGrounded on these key ideas, how does this philosophy influence education?\n- ü•Ö¬†**Goal:**\n\t- Realists believed that ==institutions had its own functions== - family, government, schools. Schools should then be ==focused on forming the intellect==, and should an exert an effort to maintain this focus¬†_(no UAAP, no intrams, no Orgs,etc :( )_\n\t- The main goal of realists, similar to the idealists is to ==cultivate human rationality==, since it is the ==human's highest \"natural\" power. ==\n\t- However, the purpose of rationality is not to access the world of the mind for the sake of intellect, but to ==discover, transmit and use knowledge of the world==, wherein schools are seen as centers for transmitting bodies of knowledge and the skill of inquiry. \n\t- In knowing the world better, the goal is for¬†humans to ==define themselves by framing their choices rationally.==\n- üìö¬†**Curriculum:**\n\t- _\"Basic to realistic curriculum is the rationale that the most efficient and effective way to find out about reality is to study it through systematically organized subject-matter disciplines\"._¬†This means that realism favors a curriculum that is ==organized based on the structures of reality==, this is similar to the way most curricula is organized today - with subjects like history, language, chemistry, physics, english, pol. sci,, etc.\n\t- A realistic curriculum is also organized according to the ==readiness and maturation of learners==, and to what has previously been learned. In primary years, the basic tools of reading, writing and computation form its foundation. In higher learning, as with today, the curriculum aims to be able to equip students with research skills and produce more generalizations about reality.\n- üí¨¬†**Methodology:**\n\t- Given this, teachers aptly serve as ==experts of subject matter== - specialization in what he/she is teaching is of utmost importance, while students are expected to be ready and willing to learn.\n\t- _The realist tends to view the Learner as a sense mechanism, the Teacher as a demonstrator, the Curriculum as the subject matter of the physical world (emphasizing mathematics, science, etc.), the Teaching Method as mastering facts and information, and the Social Policy of the school as transmitting the settled knowledge of Western civilization._\n\n##### Think and Share\n###### Prompt\n1. Do you think Filipinos are realists? Reflect on the various issues we have been facing in Philippine society in the past few months (fake news, diverse political views, dealing with the pandemic, etc.). Would you say that most of Philippine education has formed us to be realists? Why or Why not?\n2. As a future educator, what aspects of realism would you want to bring into your practice? Why?\n\n###### Answer\nPhilippine education has definitely been inspired by realism. I can see it in the curriculum and methods most universities utilize ‚Äî a subject-matter mode that is facilitated by teachers that are experts of such subject matter. However, I wouldn't say that our education system has formed us to be realists. One of the realists' goals was cultivating human rationality; seeing how the Philippines is afflicted by information disorder and post-truth politics, I would say that most Filipinos think emotionally, not rationally. This is best encapsulated by Imedla Marcos' statement: \"Perception is real, the truth is not.\" While the realists would agree with the first half of that statement (given Aristotle's beliefs in our innate capacity to perceive, and how everything we know is derived from this), they would be distraught to hear the second half (since they believed that teaching equates to disseminating truth). Therefore, I'd say that most Filipinos ascribe by a warped version of realism.\n\nAs a future educator, one aspect of realism that I would want to bring into my practice is its epistemology ‚Äî particularly its view of knowing as a twofold process involving sensation and abstraction. As a dancer and developer, I seek knowledge by looking outwards, whether it's to my body or technology; the data I get from such experiences (like bodily aches or bugs in code) help me better make sense of the world. So if I ever get to teach in the future, I would definitely utilize a constuctionist approach: emphasizing context, situated knowledge, and learning by doing.\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.731605397Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2023-03-30":{"title":"2023-3-30","content":"## Great Books\n#IDS147 \n### Assignment 2\n#### Outline\n\u003e  **Prompt:** Get a quote from any of our texts and analyze how it relates to modernism\n\n##### Ideas\n- _‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt want comfort.

Explain context of Brave New World\n\t\t- John says that the New World citizens don‚Äôt regard that ==unhappiness may also be a concept to like or to desire==, like John.\n\t\t\t- \"But I don‚Äôt want comfort. I want God, I want poetry, I want real danger, I want freedom, I want goodness. I want sin\"\n\t\t- Mustapha Mond tells him he's claiming the right to be unhappy (which sounds ridiculous at first), and John accepts it\n\t2. This quote resonates with me because...\n\t\t- I feel very alike to John in this passage, so I think this is the reason why I like it so much. I think that ==unhappiness is also a part of life that you have to experience==; you can‚Äôt avoid it and think that everything is perfect, besides, I like some aspects of being unhappy. I really think that being a happy person during all your life would be boring. ==My aim in life isn‚Äôt to be happy, it is to live.== And life consists in feeling, in having experiences, although some of them may be unpleasant.\n\t\t- A perfect world has been created, a world in which everybody is happy, people don‚Äôt get bored and nobody has problems. It is the ideal paradise on earth. Huxley makes his readers think; after reading the novel, the reader is incited to think about the meaning of real happiness, and the price for it, as well the importance of truth. The reader, if he/she has understood the meaning of the novel, would ask a question: what is better: living happily ever after (although personally I think it is a stupid happiness) or living according to the truth but suffering all kind of inconveniences.\n\t\t- I have strong indication of masochistic personality traits.\n\t\t\t- You may find that you have a pattern of self-defeating behaviors such as working to the point of exhaustion; feeling as if you have to accept pain and humiliation; always saying ‚Äúyes‚Äù even if you mean ‚Äúno‚Äù; ending up in relationships with people who are abusive towards you. You may also feel unloved, tired, and humiliated, but you do not find it easy to show others how you feel.\n\t\t\t- https://existentialcafe.blog/2021/12/14/everyday-masochism-why-are-we-workaholics/\n\t\t\t\t- Masochism is self-discipline run amok.\n\t\t\t\t- Human nature seems to reside in extremes. I don‚Äôt know why, but when we do something or believe something, we can‚Äôt half-ass it; our minds lust after broad strokes. And to so many of us, suffering is the key to bliss. Growing up, you‚Äôll recall learning about the importance of hard work and discipline; all sorts of platitudes will easily come to mind. As a culture, who we are and become are defined by our willingness to sacrifice for better days. And when people ask you what you do for a living, they really want to know how hard and how much you work. Suffering is a fetish.\n\t\t\t\t- Masochism is usually thought of in the context of S\u0026M, but it's much more prevalent ouside of sex... Fundamentally, masochism entails feelings of self-esteem and relief. On the one hand, we‚Äôre living up to our potential as we‚Äôre suffering; on the other, we feel less guilty and afraid of future catastrophes.\n\t\t\t- https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/tracking-wonder/201512/masochism-mastery-in-creative-fields\n\t\t\t\t- Whether you excel in a creative field has largely to do with problems. Namely, how you respond to them. Every big idea begets a series of challenges and problems. \n\t\t\t\t- When we hit a wall or impasse, we usually respond in one of three ways: We react, we surrender, we get inventive.\n\t\t\t\t- When you react or surrender, you disempower yourself from your innate capacity to do what creative people do best: solve problems. Both reacting and surrendering also can lead to subtle self-sabotaging.\n\t\t\t- https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1986/08/13/coping/97574b1b-e244-4a60-88fd-daf2c2cf23dc/\n\t\t\t\t- ==\"Everyday Masochism,\"== says Brandt \"is a condition rooted in low self-esteem and guilt.

At first glance, this quote seems to been said by a masochist. \n\t\t1. The character who said this, John the Savage from *Brave New World*, could definitely be seen as one, especially in the eyes of the World State.\n\t\t2. When Mustapha Mond tells him that his society prefers to do things comfortably, John counters this, stating that he desires \"inconveniences\" instead: God, poetry, danger, freedom, goodness, and sin. \n\t\t3. In response to this, Mond tells him he's claiming the right to be unhappy, which John happily agrees to.\n\t3. This quote resonated with me because it made me realize that I too, may be a masochist.\n\t\t1. To be clear, I'm not talking about masochism in the bedroom; what I'm more concerned about is the more subtle form it takes in our daily lives. Psychologist David Brandt calls this Everyday Masochism, a condition rooted in low self-esteem and guilt. Everyday masochists tend to punish themselves for exaggerated/imagined crimes, which they express through unconscious acts of sabotage, self-criticism, and repated subordination of one's interests and needs (Washington Post, 1986).\n\t\t2. In my case, such masochism mainly manifests as workaholism, or \"self-discipline run amok\" (Garber, 2021).  In the following paragraphs, I will be discussing how workaholism has taken over my life (and others'), the drivers behind this compulsive tendency, and how modernism can help us face this head-on. \n2. My experiences\n\t1. Career\n\t\t1. One of the rights John claimed was \"...the right to live in constant apprehension of what may happen tomorrow\", and I can see how I've embodied this in the exhaustive effort I put into building my career. Anxiety about my future was what led me to become career-centric early on in life.\n\t\t2. In senior high school, I started interning for entrepreneurs;  during my early college years, I got into UX/UI design; this then led me to becoming immersed in the tech industry, interning and freelancing for startups, incubators, and venture capital funds. Outside of work, I would also volunteer for local tech communities, helping other members develop their skills through my own workshops, writing, and mentorship.\n\t\t3. While I was able to achieve tremendous success (i.e. jobs, leadership positions, and scholarships), it comes with a cost: perpetual exhaustion, which is caused by working constantly. I often get stuck in an insiduous cycle: I overwork, and eventually get burnt out; I try to rest, but eventually get restless; I end up working just so I could feel fulfilled again. What keeps me stuck in this pattern is peer pressure, which is then further exacerbated by my own high expectations. So whenever I see my peers achieve all kinds of things, I can't help but worry about being left behind.\n\t2. Hobby\n\t\t1. To escape this cycle, I sought solace in my hobbies. But even workaholism bled into this part of my life. Another right John claimed was \"...the right to be tortured by unspeakable pains of every kind\", and I can see how I've lived this out in my love-hate relationship with dance.  While dance has given me immense joy and precious relationships, it has also been a source of physical and emotional pain. \n\t\t2. You see, I really wasn't born to be a dancer, given my late start, bulky body, and neurodivergence. Because of these traits, I naturally lagged behind my peers. This led me to constant rejections, such as getting less attention from my teachers and failing competition team auditions. \n\t\t3. These rejections drove me to work harder than most, but this also came with a dark side. I have a tendency to overtrain; in the past, I was afraid of taking rest days because I thought I needed to make the most of the time I have, given that I was so far behind.  Of course, this led to tons of injuries, and not being able to move at full capacity made me even more frustrated with myself.  \n\t3. Both my career and my hobby are examples of obsessive passion. I can't help but feel like these activities control me, to the point that it's difficult to imagine my life without them. How can I disengage from these pursuits when much of my self-worth relies on them? Is there even a me that exists outside of these passions?  (Morales, 2020)\n3. How modernism helps deal with this issue \n\t1. I'm sure I'm not the only one like this. Why are many people nowadays masochistic?\n\t\t1. Sam Altman: \"Existential angst is part of life. It is particularly noticeable around major life events [or] career milestones...[and] seems to particularly affect smart, ambitious people. I think one of the reasons some people work so hard is so they don‚Äôt have to spend too much time thinking about this. Nothing is wrong with you for feeling this way; you are not alone.\" \n\t2. Thesis statement: Everyday masochism is rooted in our avoidance of existential angst. I believe modernism can help us understand and thus tackle this issue by helping us develop self-awareness. It does this by equipping us with the words needed to describe our struggles...our state of being \n\t3. Concepts. Summarize the paper\n\t\t1. Absurdity\n\t\t\t1. the threat of personal meaninglessness has become a pervasive feature of modern life\n\t\t2. Identity: \n\t\t\t1. Many of us can be considered as New Cosmpolitans: People who were born with acquired the privilege to fuse their professional interests and identity with the creative expression of their inner selves\n\t\t\t2. the individual‚Äôs project of building self-esteem has become increasingly difficult in a culture that values the ‚Äúillusion of omnipotence‚Äù above all else\n\t\t\t3. instead of freeing them, this limitlessness gives rise to a nagging feeling of inadequacy that throws doubt on the meaningfulness of a life that does not actualize the deepest levels of one‚Äôs talents and contribute to the advancement of one‚Äôs chosen field in a significant way\n\t\t\t\t1. absurdity\n\t\t3. Fragmentation \u0026 Alienation\n\t\t\t1. Fragmentation\n\t\t\t\t1. two seemingly incompatible stances of acute disengagement with the world and a heightened sense of self-importance\n\t\t\t\t2. tendency toward the extreme, which, at the extreme, destroys the possibility for shared meaning.\n\t\t\t\t3. Human nature exists in the extremes. \n\t\t\t\t\t1.  For many of us, suffering is the key to bliss. \n\t\t\t2. Alienation\n\t\t\t\t1. contemporary culture‚Äôs focus on limitlessness...has created a much more isolated individual who has difficulty coping with basic human vulnerability.\n\t\t\t\t2. The tendency to feel isolated or shunned from the larger group, coupled with a sense of specialness that comes from significant intellectual talent, ‚Äúleads most New Cosmopolitans to develop a visceral antagonism to mob situations; they see natural groups as a source of danger; they are always wary of the tendency of groups to attack those who are different‚Äù. Groups, rather than serving as a source of comfort and safety as they have in all traditional societies, are experienced by the New Cosmopolitan as a source of anxiety.\n\t4. How can we find freedom?\n\n###### Dump\n- This quote resonated with me because it made me not only ponder the meaning and cost of happiness, but also question how I'm currently living my life. \n- Like John, I too choose to be unhappy, and this is seen in my masochistic tendencies. These tendencies aren't as scandalous they seem, for they are prevalent in our everyday lives. \n\n\n#### Writing","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.731605397Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2023-03-31":{"title":"2023-03-31","content":"## Biology of Science Fiction\n#BIO21i #biology #sciencefiction \n### Biology and Society\n#### Biotechnology in Science Fiction\n- **Biotechnology**¬†is the ==application of living organisms or their parts or processes for the improvement of human society and the environment.== It's something that we've been doing since 11,000 years ago when humans started domesticating plants and animals, without necessarily knowing the science behind it (proof that the applied science can come before the basic science). \n\t- The molecular revolution of the 1970s, when information about DNA, genes, and evolution took big leaps forward, transformed the field not only in real science but also in science fiction.\n- Here's the [recording of my introduction on biotechnology](https://youtu.be/0ODNqZ_umuw) during a synchronous session on 10 December for the first semester run of this course\n- And here's a [long-ish (at least longer than usual) video discussing some of the history of biotech in sci-fi](https://youtu.be/SsAKACFMquQ), with highlights on cybernetics, genetic engineering, and cloning\n- Since¬†**CRISPR-Cas9**¬†is so awesome and will play a critical role in many future biotech innovations perhaps even in sci-fi, let's hear from one of its pioneers, [2020 Nobel Prize for Chemistry winner Jennifer Doudna herself, about how it works](https://youtu.be/_PU5bCflzEM), what its potential uses are, and perhaps most importantly, what we as a society should remember when we use it.\n\t- Take special note of what she says about CRISPR-Cas9 ==being usable on the germ line, which means that these genetic changes can be inherited.==\n\n**Points for Discussion**\n1. How have you personally benefited from biotechnology?\n2. Why is biotechnology usually used as the playground of sci-fi/horror works? Is the fear of GMOs, mutants, and genetic abnormalities justified?\n3. What biotech-related sci-fi tropes do you find most fascinating and why?\n4. How can biotechnology be used to further human evolution and possibly even promote speciation of our species?\n5.

How do you feel about the prospect of a future with human clones being a common occurrence? Would you want to be cloned? Why or why not?\n\n#### Biotechnology and Utopia\n- Biotechnology, both in fiction and in real life, is usually driven by a pretty simple idea:¬†**the use of nature and its processes for the good of humankind**. \n\t- The idea is, if the bodies we currently have, the organisms with which we currently interact, the resources to which we currently have access, and the environments we currently inhabit all play major roles in the lives we lead, so ==why should we not be encouraged to alter them in order to give ourselves better lives?==\n- The spirit of biotechnology is heavily informed by the concept of¬†**[[Utopia]]**, \"an imagined society in which everything is perfect.\" \n\t- The term comes from the Greek¬†_ou_¬†(\"not\") and¬†_topos_¬†(\"place\"); a utopia is quite literally a ==non-place.== \n\t- Utopia has always been seen as ==unreachable==--for St. Thomas More, who coined the term, it was always¬†_somewhere else_, as the titular utopia in his 1516 work¬†_Utopia_¬†was an imaginary faraway island, whereas for many people today, the idea of utopia is an impossible, asymptotic vision of a perfect society. \n\t- This doesn‚Äôt mean utopia is literally impossible, bu==t the concept is informed by impossibility:== the impossibly good, the kind of good so great as to be called perfection.\n- Here's the thing: utopia is ==never objective.== Any concept ostensibly founded on the greater good is in fact ==heavily dependent on whose definition of \"good\" is at play.==\n\t- The \"perfect society\" in St. Thomas More's¬†_Utopia_, for example, reflects perfection¬†_as More and his contemporaries saw it_: the society of the text includes an elected Prince who rules for life unless removed due to tyranny, state-controlled household sizes, no private property, no lawyers, priests being allowed to marry, free hospitals, women confessing their sins to their husbands, normalized slavery, and a slew of other characteristics that more than a few people today would likely find objectionable (and not always the same kinds of people).\n- As fiction will tell you, most things require tradeoffs, and utopian-leaning science is no exception, in real life or in fiction. And more than telling us what is desirable, ==our vision of the good affects what sacrifices we see as acceptable.== \n\t- Would we trade freedom for security, perhaps, or security for freedom? Would we rather live in the harsh reality or the comforting illusion, and would our answer change depending on what our friends and loved ones chose? In biotechnological terms: ==what is immortality worth, and how many people would we sacrifice to save one life?==¬†\n\t- It's the classic¬†_Soylent Green_¬†question: if we could keep everyone fed, would it be okay to use already-dead human remains to do so? What if we killed terminally ill people with no hope of recovery to do so--is that different? What if it were murderers on death row? What if it were the dead body of someone you loved? ==To what extent are we willing to use nature's processes, and for what good, and for whom?==\n- This is the question at the heart of all visions of utopia: ==how has this happened, and was there a cost?== When these fall short, or when what is sacrificed is deemed unacceptable, we call that¬†_dystopia_, and the secret is that ==this, too, is subjective.== \n\t- In the United States today, people call enforced mask-wearing dystopian, while other (sane) people call it necessary to preserve life. This is not to validate anti-masker thought--seriously y'all, don't be a jerk, wear a mask--but to point out that ==just as our view of utopia depends on our values, so too does our view of its shadow.==\n- Biotechnology-oriented texts lend themselves to two related strands of critical thought: on the one hand, examinations of what biotechnology does for ==our perceptions of ourselves and the notion of human identity==, and on the other hand, ==the whole strain of Marxist thought==, the idea of biotech as a¬†_product_¬†and how it shapes and is shaped by capital, power, and who control them. \n\t- These two are very much related: as we gain the ability to manipulate and estrange our own identities and personhoods, we remember that ==this ability is conditioned by technology, capital, and power==; with the ability to self-define comes the risk of commodification and subjugation, to both those who control the technology that allows this self-definition as well as to the technology itself.\n\t- Relevant for #thesis \n- As we look at biology and society in this penultimate module of Biology of Science Fiction, through our readings of \"Nine Lives,\"¬†_Okja_, and House¬†_of X_, I hope we can look at them not just as cool texts, but also as explorations of the idea of utopia: its promise, its danger, its endless possibilities.\n\n#### **\"Nine Lives\":** The Measure Of A Man\n- Ursula Le Guin's \"Nine Lives\" is a short story about a future in which cloning is normalized, and, as with all things that are normalized, immediately bent to serve capitalism. The clones on which this story focuses, John Chow, are not a single individual, but rather a¬†_tenclone_: a group of ten individuals, five male and five female, all cloned from the genetic material of the original John Chow, differentiated (barely) by only their middle names. In this setting, clone units are often used as work teams, and the John Chow group are no exception.\n- We meet John Chow through the perspectives of Martin and Pugh, two non-clone members of Earth's Exploitation Corps--Martin a technician and cartographer, Pugh a geologist--tasked with working with the tenclone. The initial part of the story is mostly scene-setting, establishing Martin's and Pugh's responses to the tenclone and the way they behave, both towards each other and towards their new non-clone colleagues. The second part, set off when a tragedy leaves John Kaph Chow as the last surviving member of the tenclone, sees Martin and Pugh watching and working with Kaph as he begins to navigate life without his nine other siblings.\n- It's difficult to really sum up \"Nine Lives,\" as much of the power of the text is in the little moments it creates with and between its characters--the things that don't really make it into a plot outline--but the obvious starting point is that it's very much ==a text about identity.== What's interesting about it, though, is in the way it navigates that question. \n\t- First, the text distances it from us by centering the question of identity primarily in the character of Kaph, whereas our perspective lies more with Martin and Pugh: we as readers are not in the head of the character most affected by the question, so we're trying to figure them out as they try to figure themselves out. \n\t- Second (related to the above), the text never fully and explicitly¬†_says_¬†what Kaph is trying to figure out, but rather shows us their life before they started asking, reduces them mostly to silence after they lose their siblings, and leaves us with Martin's and Pugh's theories to try to fill in the gaps.\n- From a worldbuilding perspective, it's clear that Kaph and the rest of the tenclone are the ==archetypal worker-type artificial human: they are created to fulfill specific functions.== (Marxist criticism would have a¬†_field day_¬†with this text.) \n\t- A world like this naturally raises any number of ethical questions: should we be making clone laborers? If so, is it ethical to create them in this particular way? But what the text does so interestingly is that it doesn't raise any of these questions as part of the plot, and even its characters treat the existence and nature of the clones as matter-of-fact; the story's conflict revolves entirely around the consequences of Kaph's clone nature for his own development, but it never raises it to the level of morality. \n\t- Le Guin trusts us as readers to ponder the ethics of cloning in this story without forcing the text to revolve around it, which actually gives us more to talk about as the story focuses on the personal experience and development of one of the clones and in so doing gives us a window into what being a clone is like in this universe. ==We are presented an alternative set of norms¬†_as norm_, as fact, without reducing it to an if-then hypothetical== (and paradoxically treating Kaph more like a person or character than an issue or idea, if you want to look at it that way), which then forces us to be critical both of it and of our own world in turn.\n- Additionally, this further contextualizes Kaph's striving for us as readers, implicitly prefacing it with,¬†_\"Given that this is how I was made._\" \n\t- This sets the very personal question of identity up against the social and technological forces that created these clones, and in so doing reminds us that all our own attempts to figure ourselves out must also include ==reckoning with the world that created us.== \n\t- \"Who are we,\" the text seems to ask, \"and what do we truly have the space to be and become?\"\n\n_**Sir Ron's Note**_\n- I hope that reading¬†\"Nine Lives\" made you ask: \"How can female clones be produced from a male donor?\" because that's a legitimate concern! Remember that SCNT transfers the nucleus of the clone's cell to the surrogate egg, and that nucleus will contain the sex chromosomes. So how can an XY be turned into a female clone?\n- Theoretically, it's not too difficult. ==The presence of a Y chromosome does not automatically, 100% of the time make an individual display male characteristics.== There is a gene on the Y chromosome called the sex-determining region Y (SRY) gene that normally is active, but if it is ==inactivated by a mutation or error==, male characteristics may fail to develop properly. \n- People with Complete Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (CAIS) have XY chromosomes but physically present as females because of the inactive SRY gene. However, they generally have testes found within the abdomen (and not seen externally in a scrotum), lack a uterus, and are infertile. Le Guin's clones are mentioned to be infertile, so we can imagine that the female John Chow clones were created by ==inactivating the SRY genes== (and not by removing the entire Y chromosome!).\n- We can assume that male clones are produced from female donors, but that's much harder to explain, because the Y chromosome would have to come from another source and so that wouldn't be much of a clone!\n\n**Discussion¬†Questions**\n1.  Talk about the implications of being part of a tenclone: raised from birth with clone siblings as a single unit made for a specific purpose. What implications might this have for the clones' self-concept?\n2.  Discuss why an institution or corporation might want to create clone laborers in this way, and what this might say about this institution?\n3.  Towards the end of the text, Kaph asks Martin a question about Pugh, and when Martin responds, Kaph asks another question: \"How can you... How do you...?\" What do you think he means by this, and what are the implications of the question?\n\n#### **Severance** - Work-Life Balance\n- Here's a question to think about as we go through this discussion (and as you either watch¬†_Severance_¬†for the first time or re-watch it for the nth): if you could, would you get yourself severed?_Severance_¬†is both the title of this new Apple TV+¬†science fiction series and the name of its central¬†_novum._\n\t- A severed individual has a chip implanted into their brain, causing their access to their memories to be spatially dictated: while in the designated severed areas of their workplace, they have no access to any episodic memories they have formed outside of the workplace, while likewise being unable to access any memories from work while they are anywhere apart from these areas. \n\t- Effectively, you get to leave all your real-life baggage at the door when you come to work, and you pick it back up and leave your work baggage at the office when you leave. It's a tempting proposition--the ultimate boundary between work and the rest of your life--and it's one that Lumon, the company that invented and advocates for severance, has no doubt used to attract its workforce to itself.\n- Being severed is undoubtedly a disquieting experience (one might even call it \"a strange newness\"), both when you're at work and out of it--we see that through Helly's experience as thew new hire (we see the other side of it in the pilot) as well as Mark's conversation during his date. But the date and the scenes immediately following it show us another angle to the compelling argument for severance: in his regular life, Mark is deeply, deeply unhappy, and the thought of being able to silo off that kind of despair for half a day and get to work has got to be at least somewhat appealing.\n- But one way the show cleverly subverts that and introduces one of its major themes (more on that shortly) is in how the severed workers are discussed and talk about themselves: the terms ==\"innie\" and \"outie,\"== used depending on which facet of a severed worker is being referred to. \n\t- While at work, severed Lumon employees speculate about what their outies are like; when Mark calls in \"sick\" from outside the office, he is told his innie will be sad to have missed the day. \n\t- This very deliberate use of language helps subtly introduce a question, one the show devotes much of its first season to exploring: ==are the outie and the innie two different versions of the same person, or are they in fact two separate people?== And as viewers, the show invites us to consider how our assessment of an idea like severance changes depending on how we respond to that question.\n- _Severance_¬†also owes a lot to Karl Marx's theory of [[Alienation]] -- the idea that ==unjust labor conditions and economic stratification of society estranges people from their basic humanity.== \n\t- On some level, this is something many of us undoubtedly experience: we often feel like (or are told that) we need to prioritize work or academics or financial success, \"the things we need to do,\" over the things that make us feel alive, \"like ourselves.\" \n\t- We feel like different people when we're \"on the job\" versus we're at home, and for many of us, that difference includes feeling¬†_less_¬†like people.¬†\n\t- _Severance_¬†takes that experience and turns the volume up, literalizing Marx's theory to an almost absurd degree--\"what if we really¬†_were_different people when we were on the job?\"--and explores the implications of that hyperbolization: how society reacts to severance, how the company that employs it crafts policies and office culture to both reinforce and be shaped by it (oh look, is that a base and a superstructure I see?), and how the severed workers themselves experience the whole thing.\n- Some works of science fiction utilize ==semiotics and signification== in very philosophical, conceptual ways--\n\t- see¬†_Arrival,_¬†where the heptapods' design is an abstract signifier for the idea of Other-ness and their mind-bending language is an almost Lovecraftian representation of what it means to be able to see things differently and see things from another person's (or being's) perspective. \n\t- Others function more like¬†_Severance_, rooting themselves and their¬†_nova_¬†in concrete, on-the-ground experiences and blowing them up using the tropes and tools of science fiction, literalizing and defamiliarizing the metaphors we use to describe our experiences so they can more freely explore them.\n\t- Both \"types,\" and the infinite varieties between and around them, will have fans and people for whom they don't work, but they're really just different ways of approaching what the genre does: presenting cool, terrifying, wondrous ideas in ways that invite us to consider how different and much bigger our world might be as compared to what we see--and how much bigger and more different it might yet become.\n- Works like¬†_Severance_, like all works of science fiction, ask the question, \"What if?\"--but they also invite us to ==consider whether we should be asking something else too.== Because while we ask the question of whether or not we would get ourselves severed, we should maybe ponder whether--and in what ways--==we already are.==\n- Here's some more questions! Again, these are just prompts; feel free to answer any or all of them, or ignore them and just talk/ask questions about the text.\n\t- Do you think innies and outies should be considered different people from each other, or different versions of the same person? What from the text makes you think that?\n\t- Let's talk linguistics: how does the use of possessive pronouns (e.g. \"_my_¬†innie,\" \"_my_outie\")? affect the way we see the innie-outie dynamic? Do you think it's meant to reference anything? How does it play into the signification going on in the text?\n\t- Marx's theory of alienation and¬†_Severance_. Go nuts.\n\t- How does Lumon's workplace culture (and/or any particular aspects of it) contribute to the text's exploration of alienation?\n\n#### **House of X:** Pax Krakoa\n- Normally we talk about the X-Men in this class in context of ==evolution and the mutant metaphor.== It makes sense; they're popular superheroes, the most famous examples of the mutant metaphor, and frequently spoken of as \"the next step in evolution\" by both their allies and their enemies. The X-Men's status quo--the fear and hatred shown them by the Marvel universe's human race--is a classic example of how science fiction can portray the¬†_novum_¬†of superhuman abilities as a metaphor for the ==conditions of marginalization and oppression==: in short, people fear superpowered individuals in the same way they fear people different from them. And the X-Men are a classic response to that, a team of activist-superheroes dedicated to the idea that this discrimination can be combated through good works and a commitment to shared understanding.\n- Jonathan Hickman's ongoing run on the X-Men franchise, beginning with 2019's¬†_House of X/Powers of X_, looks at that status quo and swerves¬†_hard_¬†in another direction. In this run, the mutant race,¬†_Homo sapiens superior_, united under X-Men founder Professor Charles Xavier, have founded a country on the living island of Krakoa. Mutants from all eras of the X-Men comics can be seen throughout¬†_HOXPOX_, using both their own superhuman abilities and the wondrous properties of the island itself to create the systems--political and biotechnological--that uphold their new country. This attention to history is mirrored in the event's structure, as the comic is (almost) neatly divided into¬†_House of X_, which focuses on the present-day work of building Krakoa, and¬†_Powers of X_, which contextualizes¬†_House of X_by showing various points in the X-Men's history: the past on which Krakoa's foundations were built and the future that awaits it. Tying all this together is the trinity of Professor X, his¬†husband¬†former ideological nemesis and closest friend Magneto, and their hidden ally Moira X, a secret mutant (thought to be \"just\" a brilliant human ally of the X-Men for decades) with a power that gives her unparalleled and vital knowledge.\n- Technology is often seen as future-looking, and¬†_HOXPOX_¬†and Krakoa very much uphold this tradition while synthesizing it with what makes mutants both compelling and strange. Most mutant technology is biotechnological now, from the Cerebro helmet that interfaces with Professor X's psychic abilities to the organic architecture of the embassy to which the human ambassadors are invited in¬†_House of X_¬†#1. Even the mutants' own powers can be used in ways that are treated as biotechnological systems, from the Sleeping Giant technopath network to The Five, the group of young mutants who give Krakoa its greatest strength.\n- One especially important example of biotechnology in¬†_HOXPOX_¬†is the way in which the Krakoan nation uses the island's flowers. While some of these flowers are used to grow organic habitats and teleportation gateways, others are used to synthesize drugs that benefit¬†_Homo sapiens_. Xavier uses these drugs to gain political leverage with the human race, highlighting something very clear about the new status quo for the X-Men: this is no longer your average superhero story, but a much stranger story about ==the work of building a nation.==\n- This deliberate othering is echoed throughout the rest of the text. From the otherworldly organic architecture to the sentient, unsettling nature of Krakoa itself to the new mutant language and alphabet, our heroes are estranged as slightly bizarre and alien. (That said, if you read enough of these X-Men comics, you eventually start learning to sight-read Krakoan, which is both wonderful and the nerdiest feeling in the world.)¬†This strangeness is in keeping with what I think Hickman is doing with the mutant metaphor. Over the years, the X-Men have grown and evolved and changed: they were first seen mainly as a race metaphor (see:¬†_X-Men: God Loves, Man Kills_, the otherwise amazing comic where Kitty Pryde regrettably says the N-word), but by the 90's and 2000's, they seemed more similar to the LGBTQIA+ community, made particularly apparent by the mutant-exclusive disease called the Legacy Virus. (See also: the moment in the second X-Men film when Iceman's mother says, \"Have you ever tried... not being a mutant?\" Much later, the comics reveal that he is actually gay, so that's neat.)\n- Krakoa might then be seen as a strange version of Israel and the Jewish diaspora. (There's an¬†_excellent_¬†article about this reading¬†[here](https://www.xavierfiles.com/2019/11/04/from-jerusalem-to-krakoa-house-of-x-the-state-of-israel/).) But another way to look at it is that Hickman might be ==developing not just what the metaphor stands for, but the comics' position on how the metaphor can be responded to.== The X-Men's thrust for decades--Professor Xavier's so-called dream--wasn't just about integration, but specifically the idea that if the X-Men showed normal humans that mutants could be good, then humans would give them acceptance. But in¬†_HOXPOX_, which shows us Orchis' actions in the present as well as the past and future knowledge of Moira X, both echoing the anti-mutant violence from throughout Marvel history, the argument is different: mutants shouldn't¬†_need_¬†to be heroes to be accepted. ==The marginalized should not need to be likeable to be seen as human.==\n- Put another way,¬†_HOXPOX_¬†uses Krakoa to give us something truly unsettling: something that appears to be a genuine utopia in the making. The comic gives us a lot to fear in terms of things that could go wrong with the country, but we also see that a lot of the systems that Krakoa uses, both social and (bio)technological, seem to be genuinely oriented towards the benefit of its people and making a better world for humans and mutants alike.\n- What opposes the dream of utopia here is ==the weight of history and hate==, as shown by the multiple timeframes of¬†_Powers of X_¬†and the knowledge possessed by Moira X. The present, however, is bright, and that is itself terrifying--to mutants afraid to hope, to us as readers who distrust the idea that things might get better, to the humans in the text that want to crush it because they don't understand it. While many texts seem to believe that technology must go wrong in order for there to be a story,¬†_HOXPOX_¬†seems interested in another direction: ==what kinds of stories can there be when the technology goes right? What kinds of stories can we tell when the marginalized are able to hope?==\n\n\n**Discussion¬†Points**\n1.  What are your thoughts on the flower-produced drugs of Krakoa? How do you feel about the way Xavier uses them?\n2.  Relate #1 to the real-life search for biotechnological products among natural products from plants and animals.\n3.  Talk about The Five and their process as examples of biotechnology. What symbolic significance do they hold in light of the mutant metaphor?\n4.  Discuss how¬†_HOXPOX_¬†views the future.\n5.  Think back to Professor Doudna's four fundamental issues in CRISPR-Cas9 usage. How do these apply to Krakoa's use of biotechnology?","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.731605397Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2023-04-08":{"title":"2023-04-08","content":"## PLAY Agenda\n1.

He said this with utmost respect and love for our countrymen. And given the weight of this article, it is the best time to shed light on possible issues that could come from our go-getter attitude (see: martyrdom) to prove ourselves worthy of the opportunities we have, despite these being exploitative and ==inhumane.==\"\n\t\t- Labor Export, OFWs\n\t\t\t- Indeed, it is safe to say that ==the Philippines‚Äô main export now is its people==...Many observers would easily agree with the observation that ‚Äúno other phenomenon has paved the way for such deep and pervasive changes within the Philippine economic and social landscape‚Äù\n\t\t\t- Going on since the Spanish colonization\n\t\t\t\t- Push factors: poverty and unemployment\n\t\t\t\t- Pull factors: labor needs and labor rights in other countries\n\t\t\t- Effects\n\t\t\t\t- Individual de-skilling and national ‚Äúbrain drain‚Äù\n\t\t\t\t\t- OFWs‚Äô educational and work attainments contrast sharply with the ==‚Äúelementary occupations‚Äù== in which they are employed, especially in their first jobs abroad. Doctors become nurses; teachers become domestic workers; college graduates become construction workers. As such, ==overseas work often results in de-skilling== (Pertierra, 1994). At the national level, concerns have been raised that the ‚Äúinvisible hand has not been able to solve‚Äù problems in the ‚Äúsupply of [skilled and technical] manpower‚Äù in the country (Gonzalez, 1992, p. 30). In other words, ==skills, knowledge and labour that could be utilised for the country‚Äôs development are going out of the country.==\n\t\t\t\t- Questionable impacts on development\n\t\t\t\t\t- Aside from debt payments, OFWs‚Äô remittances are mostly spent meeting their families‚Äô needs for food, education, and healthcare‚Äîin short, ==what a decent job and government services should provide citizens with.== This has fuelled an economy that is ‚Äúconsumption-driven‚Äù, with household consumption accounting for 70% of the GDP, and ‚Äúservice-oriented‚Äù, with the service sector contributing a majority share and employing many Filipinos (Batalla, 2018, pp. 217-220).\n\t\t\t\t\t- Half a century after the start of the labour export policy, the main reason for the migration of Filipinos‚Äîthe lack of domestic employment opportunities‚Äîcontinues. The vast majority of OFWs cite gaining employment, changing jobs, or relocating for jobs as reasons for leaving the country (PSA \u0026 UPPI, 2019). The labour export policy traps Filipinos, and the Philippines economy as a whole, in ==underdevelopment and subservient neocolonialism.==\n\t\t\t\t- Distorted education priorities\n\t\t\t\t\t- Even before labour export, domestic education generally failed in ==‚Äúfostering or promoting engaged, participatory notions of citizenship that might lead to searching social or political critique‚Äù==, and thus expectations of the state are correspondingly ‚Äúminimised‚Äù.\n\t\t\t\t\t- At the same time, global labour demands result in ==education being consciously reshaped to support out-migration== by ==producing skilled and semi-skilled labour== for overseas work.\n\t\t\t\t\t- In this context, progressives and nationalists describe Philippine education as ==‚Äúcolonial,‚Äù== serving the interests of ==global powers== and other ==foreign countries and employers.==\n\t\t\t\t\t- Education also devalues local knowledge and raises students‚Äô dissatisfaction with local conditions, while the provision of knowledge of outside communities and raised expectations in life to suggest the inescapability of migrating outside of the community‚Äîall anchored in ‚Äúcolonial roots, including the powerful symbols of democracy, education, and modernity implanted by the Americans‚Äù (Pertierra, 1994, pp. 61-63). Thus, ==‚Äú[s]tudents are systematically being prepared to participate in the global arena as highly-trained, English-speaking, cheap and docile labour force catering to the demands of the international market in line with the neoliberal project‚Äù== (del Rosario-Malonzo, 2007, p. 94).\n\t\t\t\t- Aspects of culture\n\t\t\t\t\t- Desire to support families\n\t\t\t\t\t- Deep religosity\n\t\t\t\t\t- ^ The last two, in particular, are insidious. Filipinos are being trained into an attitude of finding a way or ‚Äúpakikipagsapalaran (destiny-playing or adventure) and pagbabakasakali (chance-taking)‚Äù (Tadiar, 2004, p. 244) in a framework of subservience and inferiority. ==The education system teaches them that their country is in bad shape, that they are suited for jobs abroad, and that the only way to a better life for them and their country is to leave and be exploited by foreigners.== Socially, there are those who deal with the trauma of exploitation and suffering in narratives of triumph and self-sufficiency, glorifying their subservience and exploitation. In the long term, what does this do to the psyche of a country and a people?\n\t\t\t- Takeaways: Decolonizing the Philippine Economy\n\t\t\t\t- We can support measures and struggles upholding the various rights of OFWs, even as we recognise that these ==only address the symptoms== of the problem. \n\t\t\t\t- We can also support measures and struggles that seek to change the ==root causes of labour migration.==\n\t\t\t\t\t- Since OFWs are everywhere, every call for improving migrants‚Äô working and living conditions anywhere would most likely be to their benefit. The easiest step and bare minimum step is supporting calls for ==living and fair wages, minimum rest days, and non-discrimination,== among others. \n\t\t\t\t\t- Support migrant workers‚Äô efforts to ==form organisations at the grassroots== level to lay claim to their rights, bearing in mind that in some contexts, even citizens are denied such freedoms. While the national migration survey states that a small minority of OFWs belong to organisations, there are efforts among OFWs in most migrant-receiving countries in this direction. \n\t\t\t\t\t- Supporting calls directed by OFWs to the Philippine government. These include creating decent jobs at home, providing immediate support, removing government exactions, and expanding the range of services provided by embassies and consulates. \n\t\t\t\t\t- Filipinos, talk to your friends and family. Ask yourself what working abroad does for your country and your people. What country do you want? How can you collectively change it? \n\t\t\t\t\t- ==Demand that your government take responsibility.== Send this article to politicians. Tell them about the damage the labour export policy does to the nation and the people. Support calls for an end to the labour export policy in favour of increased domestic economic growth and job creation. We recognise that this is difficult to achieve. However, it is only by ==generating genuine agricultural and industrial development== to create decent jobs at home and provide for the basic needs of Filipinos that a significant solution can emerge.\n\t- The Miseducation of the Filipino\n\t\t- [Summary](https://businessmirror.com.ph/2021/02/04/the-university-as-a-sanctuary-of-critical-thinking/)\n\t\t\t- In brief, the thesis of Constantino is that ==the growth and progress of the country lie in an emancipatory educational system.== This is an educational system capable of graduating students possessing the knowledge and skills to decipher the problems and development challenges facing the country in various fields of human endeavor‚Äîsocial, scientific, economic, cultural, political and so on‚Äîand to find the answers to these problems and challenges. Honing these knowledge and skills requires the existence of educational institutions that are fully dedicated to the search for knowledge based on a critical understanding of ourselves, the world we live in and our place within it.\n\t\t\t- We need educational institutions that promote critical thinking, reflected in the free yet rigorous inquiry, discourse, debate and dialogue on the problems haunting the nation. For this to happen, educational institutions, especially those of higher learning, must be able to ==foster an environment of critical and scientific inquiry free from outside interference and censure==, as enunciated by Unesco and great universities worldwide.

This is especially true in the Philippines, which relies on labor export in order to keep its economy afloat. Nonetheless, despite the demands of the globalized world, the Filipino children and youth should not only be sent to schools to be taught skills that would make them competent laborers for capitalist markets, but more importantly, ==they should be trained to become critical thinkers so as to be open, sensitive, and understanding of the beliefs and values of others as well as not to be enslaved by their respective belief and value systems.== In this light, this paper discusses how critical thinking can be taught more effectively in education institutions in the Philippines through reconsideration of the Taxonomy of Learning Objectives and a push for Critical Pedagogy. I will argue that the ==Taxonomy is reductive and lacking in terms of developing critical thinking in students, whereas, critical pedagogy brings the children and the youth to the table of dialogue by teaching them how to raise and accept questions without the attitude of hostility, the latter being a characteristic of an uncritical and enslaved mind.==\n\t\t- Problem\n\t\t\t- The Taxonomy of Educational Objectives and Its Detriments to Philippine Education\n\t\t\t\t- Philippine education is by and large influenced by ==capitalist interests.== This means that students and graduates are geared toward ==replenishing the country‚Äôs labor force.== For this reason, the quality and objectives of education are focused on ==skills training.== Thus, educational objectives are formulated in relation to ==skills development==\n\t\t\t\t- dangers in viewing thinking skills as stringently hierarchical\n\t\t\t\t\t- education may simply be reduced to skills training since skills-based jobs rarely require a level of thinking that goes beyond Bloom‚Äôs socalled ‚Äúlower order‚Äù.\n\t\t\t\t\t- it may develop the misconception that there are people who are capable of higher order thinking and there are those who are not.\n\t\t- Proposed solution: [[Cards/Critical pedagogy]] (a.k.a. develop a counter-consciousness)\n\t\t\t- Methods\n\t\t\t\t- Allowing avenues for dialogue\n\t\t\t\t\t- the role of dialogue is to ==break the culture or theme of silence==, which is characteristic of oppression\n\t\t\t\t\t- it is the responsibility of teacher education institutions to produce educators that are not afraid to establish a dialogical relationship with their students in order to develop them to become critical thinkers.\n\t\t\t- Examples: \n\t\t\t\t- Liberal arts universities like Ateneo\n\t\t\t\t- Educational Discussions? by NDMOs?\n\t\t\t- Benefits\n\t\t\t\t- critical thinking skills can benefit Filipino students in the globalized world by making them open-minded, sensitive, and understanding of the beliefs and values of others. \n\t\t\t\t- This is important because in a globalized world, individuals from different cultures and backgrounds interact with each other more frequently. Critical thinking skills can help students navigate these interactions by enabling them to analyze information, evaluate arguments, and make informed decisions based on evidence. \n\t\t\t\t- Additionally, critical thinking skills can help students become more adaptable to change and better equipped to solve complex problems\n\t\t\t- Challenges\n\t\t\t\t- Introduction\n\t\t\t\t\t- Misconceptions in teaching for thinking\n\t\t\t\t\t- The quantity of information given is prioritized over the development of critical thinking\n\t\t\t\t\t- Didactic teaching is easier than reflective teaching considering all the other things that a teacher is expected to do (lesson planning, checking and grading of exams, etc.) \n\t\t\t\t\t- Many teachers are not used to the reflective approach\n\t\t\t\t\t- The government is bent on producing skilled laborers more than critical thinkers\n\t\t\t\t- ‚Äúwill a nation stand up against oppression and welcome critical pedagogy if they do not feel oppressed at all?‚Äù\n\t\t\t\t\t- majority of the Filipino people need to overcome their desensitized attitude towards their oppression and not become oppressors, themselves.\n\t\t\t\t\t- convince the public that domination is not the key to social transformation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t- Domination is a product of power struggle wherein the strong overcomes the weak and oppresses them\n\t\t\t\t- market-driven outlook on education. \n\t\t\t\t\t- ‚ÄúTeachers are increasingly reduced to the status of technicians and denied any control over their classrooms or school governance structures‚Äù (Giroux, 2011, p. 153). \n\t\t\t\t\t- Whereas students are seen as investments for the job market, teachers are regarded as manufacturers of skilled laborers and schools as factories.\n\t- Hook: [Dreamless Pinoys](https://www.philstar.com/business/2022/01/14/2153698/dreamless-pinoys)\n- Eras\n\t- Renaissance\n\t\t- Humanism: man's faith is determined by man himself (instead of doctrine)\n\t\t- New spirit of inquiry into knowledge brought about by...\n\t\t\t- Scholasticism\n\t\t\t- Explorations and scientific discoveries\n\t\t- Italian\n\t\t\t- About:\n\t\t\t\t- Individual humanism\n\t\t\t\t- Personal culture, individual freedom, and development\n\t\t\t\t- Artistocratic\n\t\t\t- Aims:\n\t\t\t\t- Liberal education\n\t\t\t\t- Holistic development\n\t\t\t\t- Individual excellence and personal self-realization\n\t\t\t- Types:\n\t\t\t\t- Literary education: knowledge and models for new creative literary effort\n\t\t\t\t- Aesthetic Education\n\t\t\t\t- Moral Education\n\t\t\t- Content: (can use as inspiration for curriculum)\n\t\t\t\t- Life of Past\n\t\t\t\t- World of Emotions\n\t\t\t\t- World of Nature\n\t\t\t- Agencies \u0026 Organization:\n\t\t\t- Methods:\n\t\t\t\t- Written themes\n\t\t\t\t- Self-expression and self-activity\n\t\t\t\t- Adjustment to individual differences\n\t\t\t\t- ==Development of interest and power to think==\n\t\t\t\t- Play, Variety, Motivation\n\t\t- Northern (we need this more)\n\t\t\t- About:\n\t\t\t\t- Social and moral reform-- means of achieving a full life\n\t\t\t\t- Religious in spirit\n\t\t\t\t- Democratic: aimed at rich and full lives for masses as well as for the favored few\n\t\t\t- Aims:\n\t\t\t\t- Social \u003e individual\n\t\t\t\t- Objective and moralistic\n\t\t\t\t- Social reform and improvement of human relationships\n\t\t\t\t- Rich and full life of society as a whole\n\t\t\t- Types:\n\t\t\t\t- Religious ed\n\t\t\t\t- Moral ed\n\t\t\t\t- Social ed\n\t\t\t\t- Democratic type\n\t\t\t- Content:\n\t\t\t- Agencies \u0026 Organization:\n\t\t\t- Methods:\n\t\t\t\t- Avoid Ciceronianism\n\t- Reformation\n\t\t- both sides used education as a weapon\n\t\t- Protestant\n\t\t\t- Education for everyone\n\t\t\t- Broad \u0026 Rich Curriculum with Best Teaching Principles\n\t\t\t\t- Luther advocated for a broader range of subjects to be taught to students based on¬†==_liberalis_¬†study that taught students to contribute to society== rather than¬†==_servilus_¬†education that simply taught one skill to keep people in servitude.==\n\t\t\t\t- He also insisted on teaching being in the vernacular.

They are deemed modern-day heroes due to the impact of their overseas remittances. On a macro level, these help grow GDP, energizing the economy; on a micro level, these help ensure better lifestyles for their families. However, labor migration's positive effects are short term; left in their wake are long-term problems for the country‚Äôs development, including: individual de-skilling, national \"brain drain\", encouragement of *endo* (contractualization), and scarcity of local jobs. Overall, the Philippines' labour export policy traps its citizens and economy in underdevelopment and subservient neocolonialism (Marasigan, 2022).\n \nBehind this trap is the Philippines‚Äô colonial education, which is designed to serve the interests of global powers and other foreign countries/employers. Through the use of English as the medium of instruction, the influx of duty-free cheap American goods, and the transplantation of Western institutions/ideas, Filipinos were trained to become the perfect labor force for the international market. But we have also become aliens to ourselves, disconnected from our identities and each other; this lack of nationalism has crippled us in many ways, from preventing critical thinking to barring democratic leadership (Constantino, 2010; Marasigan, 2022). Therefore, unlocking the Philippines' potential for growth and progress lies in an emancipatory educational system; here, students and teachers alike are not only able to acknowledge and question their current realities, but also able to work towards better futures, free of society's mental constraints.\n\n\n\nThis requires environments of critical inquiry\nThis isn't a new idea; for inspiration, we can take a look at the Renaissance and Reformation movements.\n\n\n- the same country that lauds/upholds them is the one that condones their exploitation. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConstantino (2010) believed that the country's potential for growth and progress lies in an emancipatory educational system. ==SENTENCE EXPOUNDING ON WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE FOR STUDENTS.== This isn't a new idea; for inspiration, we can take a look at the Renaissance and Reformation movements. \n\nSimilar to Constantino's vision, the humanists of the Renaissance saw education as a way to bring out human beings' full potential. This was driven by a new spirit of inquiry into knowledge, which was brought about by dissatisfaction with intellectually surpressive institutions. Italian humanists aimed to live rich and full lives through the harmonious development of the mind, body, and morals, along with the encouragement of individual excellence and personal self-realization. In line with these objectives, the main skill emphasized by Italian humanists was appreciation of the world. Their main types of education ‚Äî literary and esthetic ‚Äî exposed students to the literary, visual, and performing arts; meanwhile, their curriculum highlighted three aspects of life: the life of the past, the world of emotions, and the world of nature (Wilds \u0026 Lottich, 1961, pp. 161-166). I believe this humanities-centered approach can be used to create a nationalistic education; this builds strong foundations (a.k.a. knowledge of local culture and history) that make people less prone to the influence of foreign media. However, this is not enough. To assure national survival, education must \"...produce a citizenry that [not only] appreciates and is conscious of its nationhood...[but also] has *national goals for the betterment of the community* [emphasis added]...not an anarchic mass of people who know how to take care of themselves only\" (Constantino, 2010, p. 15). Italian humanist education fails to fulfill the latter objective due to its individualistic and aristocratic nature; it has self-centered aims, and is only available to a privileged few. Northern humanists fill this gap by aiming at a rich and full life for society as a whole; they thought that achieving a meaningful life required social and moral reform. This can be seen in their emphasis of religious, moral, and social education, much of which was grounded on classical and Biblical texts. They also worked to provide democratic education, believing that rich and full lives should be possible for the masses too (Wilds \u0026 Lottich, 1961, pp. 169-170). \n\nNaturally, the Northern humanists' zeal for social reform led to criticism of the church, which then propelled the Reformation era. After unjust societal systems were brought to light (e.g. oppressive political and economic conditions; religious and eccleiastical evils), the masses learned to question religion and other aspects of life; this gave them the freedom and power to decide their own fate, freeing them from being dependent on an educated upper class (Wilds \u0026 Lottich, 1961, pp. 178-179; National Geographic, 2017).  We can trace this paradigm shift to one of the Reformers' principles:  Scripture Alone (_sola Scriptura_). It demanded that every person must be able to read and understand the Scripture on their own ‚Äî which discouraged reliance on the church and clergy. This also entailed a need for every person to develop literacy and critical thinking, calling for a reformation of education. Reformers like Luther advocated for this by promoting human-centered ideas, such as universal education, along with broad and rich curriculums. These were based on humanist teaching principles: holistic development, inclusivity (shown by use of the vernacular), Academic Freedom. Luther believed that education must teach students how to contribute to society (*liberalis* study) instead of skills that simply keep them in servitude (*servilus* education) (Criss, 2017). To summarize, humanists and reformists alike would be against the Philippines' colonial education due to its dehumanizing nature. By keeping the country subservient to global powers and other foreign countries/employers, it prevents Filipinos from living rich and full lives. \n\nThe influence of these past eras can still be seen in Philippine education. Humanists would be delighted to see the liberal arts education offered by most of our top universities. But they would be saddened to see that the humanities is currently fighting for its place in curricula: Philippine history was removed in high school, Filipino/Panitikan are no longer mandated subjects in college, and general education subjects were proposed to be removed from the tertiary level (Ignacio, 2019; Rey, 2019; Cahiles-Magkilat, 2022). Exacerbating this issue is a prevalent culture of anti-intellectualism, where most Filipinos tend to see high intelligence as a negative trait. This is rooted in longstanding colonialism and classism; it's difficult for the (typically uneducated and poor) masses to empathize with the intelligent, especially when these people often become their oppressors (Madrazo-Sta. Romana, 2015). Meanwhile, similar to the Reformation, Philippines education is being utilized as a weapon of indoctrination. But instead of the church, I'd' argue that it's the state waging war. They want to teach Filipinos *what* to think, not *how* to think. Aside from the removal of the humanities, this is also exhibited by the reintroduction of mandatory ROTC and the authorization of police/military to enter campuses; these examples display officials' limited conception of education as \"...a narrow program of skills development, rote learning and even simple indoctrination\" (Ofreneo, 2021). \nBut we must remind ourselves that even the state is just a puppet ‚Äî it's the international powers that are pulling the strings. How can we claim we're independent when our schools still nurture colonial mindsets? Because of these minds, we remain enslaved laborers. \n\nThe main insight I drew from this process is that Filipinos are deeply embedded in intersecting systems of oppression, particularly capitalism and colonization, which leads to all the various ways we experience domination (Collins, 2000). Thus, solutions that do not acknowledge these underlying systems are likely to be ineffective in the long-term; for instance, measures upholding OFW rights is not enough to stop brain drain.  Related to this, reviewing history is helpful for becoming a systems thinker. As a designer, I want to ensure that the solutions I come up with aim to not just treat surface symptoms, but also tackle root causes. However, I admit that this process makes me feel helpless too; seeing how deep and pervasive problems can get makes me wonder if there is actually anything impactful that I can do, especially when it comes to macro forces like the economy. \n\n\n- End: Martin Luther King on labor and dignity? \"No work is significant.

In contrast, \"Dewey emphasized a changing and evolutionary universe where the human situation was not to transcend experience but rather to use it to solve human problems\" (Gutek, 2017) \n    4. He critiqued the metaphysical dualism that philosophies like Idealism and Realism had assumed (mind and body). According to him, the effect of such a perspective was the separation of theory and practice - making formal education \"excessively abstract and bore little relationship to the learner's own personal and social experience.\" (Gutek, 2017). The detachment of Idealism and Realism from life's personal and social realities was his biggest critique.\n**2. What is the nature of Knowledge? (Epistemology)**\n    1. Because of this view of reality, knowing then should be \"experimental and in a common-sense way followed the method of scientific inquiry\" (Gutek, 1997). \n    2. Intelligence, for the pragmatist, is not measured by the ability for intellectual thought or the amount of knowledge one has acquired, but is ==\"the ability to define and solve problems, acquired through the experience of persisting and working through problem-solving situations\"== (Gutek, 2017) \n**3. What is the nature of Values? What is good? (Axiology)**\n    1. Dewey rejected an absolute hierarchical arrangement of values that the idealists and realists believed in, because in reality, ==humans are confronted with conflicting hierarchies and value systems.== He also critiqued how the hierarchy of values are often based on the past, justified in the context of a certain time and place, and not of the needs of the present. ==Goodness for a pragmatist is what is best for the present.==\n    2. For the pragmatist, value is based on \"human preferences, wants, wishes, desires, and needs...If a person had only a single desire, then he or she would act to satisfy that desire. In the case of value conflict, it was necessary to unify the apparently conflicting desires. If the desires could not be unified, then one had to choose between conflicting alternatives. Choice was made by evaluating the possible consequences of acting on the chosen preference. (Gutek, 2017)\n    3. The way pragmatists see value or the good is consistent with the ==rejection of dualism== - in society, democracy is favored, and dualisms in society are rejected - such as segregation based on class, race, sex, or ethicity. \n    \n#### Pragmatism in Education\n- Here's a quick recap of some of the key ideas. In pragmatism,\n  - reality is based on experience, the individual's interaction with the changing environment\n  - knowing results from experiencing, testing ideas by acting on them, and using the scientific method\n  - values are situational and culturally relative\n- Grounded, on these key ideas, how does this philosophy influence education? \n- **ü•Ö GOAL**\n  - In pragmatism, the goal is ==growth== - for students to grow to be able to reconstruction of experiences that leads to the direction and control of subsequent experiences. As mentioned, Pragmatism is grounded in the fundamental belief that reality is every changing, thus education is not aimed at simply knowing, but preparing students for this changing world - for them to understand the relationships and interconnections among experiences. \n  - In education that followed idealism or realism, the goal was mainly \"preparation\" - for one set of knowledge to be understood to prepare them to understand the next. The application of knowledge is to happen in the future.  For pragmatists, to defer the application of learning or action to the future is unacceptable because ==the future might have changed, and what has been learned may no longer be appropriate anymore.==\n- **üìö CURRICULUM**\n  - The pragmatist curriculum challenges the traditional subject-matter curriculum. It critiques how formal schooling that has taken this former approach has made it ==abstract and separated from the child's own interest, needs and experiences.== In pragmatism, the following are instead what is seen as essential \"subjects\":\n    - Making and Doing - using and manipulating raw materials\n    - History and Geography - to enlarge the scope of a child's temporal and spacial experiences.\n    - Social education - gradual contact with actual realities and needs of society.\n    - Organized Sciences - knowledge of various sciences as tools for problem solving.\n    - Ideally interdisciplinary.\n- **üí¨ METHODOLOGY**\n  - The pragmatist teaching methodology is ==Problem-solving.== This is consistent with the aim of preparing students for an unforeseen future - instead of aiming for knowledge, the aim for a capacity to deal with this uncertainty. \n  - In a pragmatic classroom, the teacher is a guide and not just the expert. Thus, there is a bias for forming a strong sense of ==self-direction and self-discipline.== Teachers frame learning experiences by posing problems or situations relevant to the learners, and allows learners the space to go through a process of problem solving.\n  - A common pragmatic approach popular now is project-based learning.

Each philosophy is grounded on a belief about reality, and what is important in reality. As you form your own teaching philosophy, this might be a good question to ask. \n\t2. What for you is most important? Why do you think so? How is what you think is important related to your notion of reality?\n2. **What should be known?**\n\t1. A second question that each philosophy asked was one about knowledge. \n\t2. As an educator in the future, this is a common question you will continue to ask as you design curriculum and prepare for lessons - what is important to know? Therefore, what should be taught?\n3. **What is valuable?**\n\t1. Finally, as we have discovered in the course, education is not just about knowledge or abilities, but also about values - what are your values? \n\t2. What is goodness to you? What values do you think are most important to impart to your students?\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.735605378Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2023-04-20":{"title":"2023-04-20","content":"## Contemporary Issues: Psychology and Personal Growth\n#psychology #personaldevelopment \n### Self-Help Manual\n#### Outline\n##### Insight List\n- The Good Life\n\t- [[Eudaimonia]]\n\t- Good life = flourishing\n\t- Flourishing is historically and contextually contingent\n\t\t- Karl Marx tied the good life to revolution -- particularly a proletariat revolution against capitalists and against the capitalist system\n\t- The good life requires tensions\n\t\t- Situational\n\t\t- Creative\n\t\t- Accepting\n- Identity\n\t- PVEST\n\t- Personal identity is...\n\t\t- Dynamic\n\t\t- Intersectional\n\t\t- Interactional\n\t- Relation to habits\n\t\t- Habits are resilient\n\t\t- Willpower is the most important keystone habit\n\t\t-   Movements are born from strong ties, peer pressure, and new habits.\n\t\t- Habits are really about identities (see PVEST)\n- Emotional Hygeine\n\t- [[Emotional Hygeine]]\n\t- [[Loneliness creates a deep psychological wound]]\n\t- [[Cards/Stop emotional bleeding]]\n\t- [[Human connection is the built-in mechanism for stress resilience]]\n\t- [[Caring creates resilience]]\n\t- [[Procrasination is a self-defense mechanism]]\n- Social Capital as Brokerage and Closure\n\t- [[Social capital]]\n\t- [[Brokerage]]\n\t- [[Closure]]\n\t\t- [[Closed networks facilitate trust and shared beliefs by creating and maintaining reputations]]\n- Intimacy, Sex, (In)fidelity\n\t- Sexual projects\n\t- Sexual citizenship\n\t- Sexual geography\n- Organization and Mental Health\n\t- [[Stress is a culture]]\n\t- [[Structural secrecy]]\n- Slavery and Freedom\n\t- We get used to slavery\n\t- [[Freedom requires awareness of exile]]\n\t- [[God calls each of us to the vocation of freedom]]\n\t- [[What makes change difficult is fear]]\n\t- [[Leadership involves helping yourself and others see things in a new light]]\n\t- [[Cards/Change happens only when we are willing to leave the familiar-that-enslaves behind]]\n\t- [[Ubuntu]]\n- Art of Choosing\n\t- [[Passion principle]]\n\t- [[Passion perpetuates inequality]]\n\n##### Idea Dump\n- Something similar to woke scientist substack\n\t- Abolotiomism, decolonization, liberation, unplug from capitalism, ground in community and our ecosystems\n- Self-help manual for artists?

These all mark the end of an era, but also the beginning of a new journey. However, I can't help but feel like nothing is going to change. Many of us have already been through this process before, just in different flavors: internships, org positions, college applications, etc. We put so much effort into developing ourselves just to ensure better futures. But in an increasingly competitive world, will we will never stop fighting for this security?\n\nProbably not. \"The trouble with the rat race is that even if you win, you're still a rat,\" Lily Tomlin says. We can't get off the hamster wheel because we don't know what life is like without constantly running. So what drives this hamster wheel? According to Yancey Strickler, our society is trapped by three assumptions: (1) the good life is all about  maximizing your self-interest and wealth; (2) we're individuals trapped in an adversarial world; and (3) that this path is inevitable ‚Äî a necessary tension for achieving this good life. Behind all of these assumptions is \"financial maximization\": the belief that the rational choice in any decision was whichever option made the most money.  As a result, we are always optimizing for money.\n\nConsequently, we see everything through an economic lens. We unconsciously view ourselves and other people as commodities, judging based on the amount of \"value\" that can be provided; this leads us to curating our identites and networks, as shown by both recruiting and dating. Through our resumes and interviews, we present ourselves in  a way that makes us look like a potential asset for hiring companies; similarly, through our profiles, we depict ourselves in a way that makes us look like a potential partner  for searching singles ‚Äî who alre also filtering themselves. So through this lens, everything becomes a transaction. For instance, when we connect with others, we inherently expect to benefit from it: love, opportunities, information, etc.  \n\nI believe that this perspective (the economic lens) is reductive, and it has led us to indiscriminate destruction ‚Äî of ourselves and those around us. For instance: burnout is so pervasive within this generation, yet we continue to allow it anyways. Why? It's because being burnt out is now part of our identities. Living in a reign of financial maximization has pushed us to constantly work in order to assert our worth. This way of coping with the times  became a self-reinforcing habit (workaholism), which then brought about a dominant identity: (workaholic). Basically, we never quit the rat race because we consider ourselves rats. \n\nAnd this workaholism is further encouraged by our culture; you know what they say: ‚ÄúChoose a¬†job¬†you love and¬†you will never have to¬†work¬†a¬†day¬†in¬†your life.‚Äù It won't feel like running if you enjoy it, right? But in the end, it's still work. To us, passion is our motivation; to society, it is fuel for labor. In fact, according to Erin Cech, this passion principle has culturally legitimized and reproduced an exploited, overworked white-collar labor force. The psychological harms of being exploited and overworked are  undeniable; workers are constantly exposed to failure and rejection (thanks to living in a dog-eat-dog world), and they are estranged from their humanity (Marx's theory of alienation). In other words, passion enables dehumanization. And minorities bear the brunt of this ‚Äî for passion perpetuates class, race, and gender segregation and inequality. No one wins in this rat race...except the capitalists.\n\nWe learn to deal with this inhumane system through emotion-focused coping, or what I like to call self-care: reciting affirmations, engaging in hobbies, practicing mindfulness, etc. While these coping skills are helpful, they are also band-aid solutions, addressing only the symptoms of the problem that is capitalism. I would argue that these solutions actually perpetuate it; looking at the giant wellness and self-help industries (e.g. skincare and the book genre), we can see how capitalism both profits from self-care and utilizes it to sustain worker productivity. Self-care encourages us to go at our own pace, but it also motivates us to continue running the race. In order to save ourselves, we must tackle our problem by the roots. \n\nIt all starts with recognizing our enslavement. It's quite the paradox, isn't it, how in a laissez-faire system we are unfree? We are enslaved by not only a capitalist society, but also ourselves (through certain habits like workaholism). Acknowledging our undesirable status quo (while painful) will open us to new possibilities, which will allow us to rethink our conception of the good life. Personal fulfillment alone is no longer enough; if we want to be truly free, we must work *together* towards the liberation of others. The ancient African concept Ubuntu (\"I am because we are\") represents this beautifully; it indicates that our freedom is tied to everyone else's, and that we cannot be free if others remain enslaved. This is best exemplified by movements (e.g. mutual aid groups, strikes, campaigns, etc.) and their power to create change. \n\nTherefore, the best way to challenge our status quo is by building community.  According to Dr. Ayesha Khan, it helps us cope with our distress more sustainably and critically engage with oppressive systems when necessary; she writes: \"If we don't spend time together or laugh and cry together, cook together, mourn together and practice being emotionally vulnerable together...how will we fight oppressive systems together? If we cannot prioritize caring for each other, being intimate with each other, being soft, and nurturing, how will we be free\"?. Human connection is our built-in mechanism for stress resilience; given that we are deeply immersed in the culture of stress, caring for each other is more vital than ever.\n\nOverall, hustle culture is dehumanizing; as a form of slavery (both internally and externally), it applies not just to the captured (workers), but also to the captors (owners). In the end, everyone is a servant of money. We will only be able to truly flourish when we are all free from enslavement, and this all starts from connecting with each other. In a society that aims to isolate us from ourselves and one another, caring is truly revolutionary. To end this reflection, I'll leave you with this beautiful African proverb: \"If you want to run fast, run alone. If you want to run far, run together.\"\n\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/Co8BVHIuNRg/\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.735605378Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2023-04-21":{"title":"2023-04-21","content":"## Discerning Life Questions\n#DLQ10 #religion #spirituality \n### The Book of Job \n- **Why does God allow the Innocent to Suffer?**\n- The Book of Job is one of the most beautiful pieces of¬†**Hebrew poetry**¬†in all of the Bible even if it deals with such a harrowing theme.\n### \"Everything happens for a reason\"\n- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcJmIbn5nw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTcJmIbn5nw)\n- **Supplementary reading:**¬†\n\t- This reading is the preface and first two chapters of his book¬†_Where the Hell is God?_¬†In simple and down-to-earth language filled with stories, this short book brings its readers to a reflection of the mystery of suffering in the Christian tradition.\n\t- Here is its bibliographical entry:¬† Leonard, Richard.¬†_Where the Hell is God?:_¬†Mahwah, NJ: Paulist =Press, 2010.\n### Jesus' Context\n#### [Immersing in a Pool (Jesus is Human)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HV28dGSPicU)\n\u003e  I miss swimming! (Believe it or not, yes I do swim!) I want to use this as an image to describe what I think the appropriate response to suffering is. It will then lead us to a timeless Christian theological question:¬†**Who is Jesus?**  From here on, we will observe the life and ministry of Jesus Christ as a way of looking at how we can deal with suffering in this world.\n\n- Why does God allow the innocent to suffer?\n- How do we respond to suffering?\n- One response to suffering is **resentment**. But another response to suffering is **immersion**. \n\t- Immersion = learning how to enter the suffering of another person\n\t- May not provide all the solutions, but it's a good place to begin\n- An image we can use to visualize immersion is swimming. It's really about putting your whole body under water so that it all gets wet.\n\t- Immersion = when your whole person is involved\n- Problem: For many of us, Jesus is a very familiar figure. However, our images of Jesus tend to be so distant. Is Christianity jsut all about this?\n\t- Jesus is more than just a miracle-worker.\n- Proposal: **Jesus is God's immersion in our condition.**\n\t- God doesn't just sit by the pool of our existence and gets his feet wet. He doesn't just wade around the pool of human condition, not fully involved.\n\t- Christians believe that in the person of Jesus, God goes underwater, fully immersed, fully involved in the human condition.\n- Jesus is fully divine, but he is also **fully human**\n- Our images of Jesus are truthful, but they are also polished\n\t- The human element is underemphasized/neglected\n\t- Jesus suffered too\n- The \"hocus pocus\" moments are *not* what make Jesus special. But it was His uncanny, radical ability to immerse in people's suffering.\n- Summary\n\t- Yes, Jesus is **divine**. But don't forget that He's also as **human** as you and me. \n\t- His **divinity** is seen in His **humanity.** They are not separate dimensions.\n- In Jesus, we will find a God who immerses and connects with the suffering of His people.\n\n\n#### [Are Crowns Still a Thing? (The Kingdom of God)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJNbkZhhn8w)\n\u003e We will talk about whether or not \"kingdoms\" are still relevant today and why Jesus seems to be promoting one. And what does this have to do with suffering?\n\n- *The Crown* show\n\t- Likes how it portrays the royal family in a balanced way\n- To understand Jesus, we must start with what He stood for: **the Reign of God**\n- Albert Nolan's *Jesus Before Christianity* (Chapters: The Poor and the Oppressed; Healing; Forgiveness)\n\t- Reason for title: Nolan wanted to deal with Jesus in his historical context\n- In Jewish society, there were these social classes:\n\t- Phraisees: scholars and teachers of the Law\n\t- Sadducees: priestly class; Temple authorities\n\t- Essenes: pious group of Jews who withdrew from the city\n\t- Zealots: revolutionaries\n\t- Skilled workers: those who had a decent, middle-class livelihood\n\t\t- Jesus belonged to this group\n\t- ^ These groups are the minority population\n\t- *Anawhim*: the poor and oppressed\n\t\t- Collective term\n\t\t- Majority population\n\t\t- They didn't matter; they were set aside because of their \"uselessness\"\n- Jesus' mission was especially for the **marginalized** in Jewish society.\n- Who exactly are the poor and oppressed?\n\t- **Sick persons** (lepers, crippled, blind, deaf, mute, etc.)\n\t- **Persons of ill repute** (tax collectors and prostitutes)\n- ^ Assumption: \"They must have done something for God to punish them in that way\"\n- The Book of Job destroys the **\"scoreboard model\"** of morality.\n- What was currently going on? **Humanity's flawed ways were in charge.**\n- The Great Prohibition: **Do not consume for yourself all the forces and powers in the world!**\n\t- From Genesis; The Fruit of Good and Evil\n\t- Implication: when humanity takes control, things tend to be corrupt\n- ***Splagchnizomai*** (Greek term): \"compassion\" that arises from the pain of seeing something wrong\n\t- Jesus' response\n\t- The English word \"compassion\" is not enough to encapsulate what it truly means; it's truly painful, like a pain in the gut\n\t- Similar to the compulsion of wanting to squeeze a baby's cheeks\n\t- When you see something bad, you feel compelled to do something about it\n- The Reign of God is more about **service** than it is about power.\n\t- *Shalom:* an order that yields well-being, goodness, love, peace -- the things that make us fully alive. These are what God stands for\n\t- Versus humanity that tends to be pusillanimous ( see [[Cards/Pusillanimity]])\n\t- It's not about taking control, but learning how to use what you have in the service of others\n- Jesus will aim to reverse ~~hubris~~ with ***diakonia***: service to the poor and oppressed\n\t- Not a self-oriented power, but a self-bearing service\n- You will find that Jesus will dedicate His life to reversing this mistaken sense of ***temporal retribution.***\n- \n \n\n### Jesus Before Christianity\n- After dealing with who Jesus is, we now focus on His life and mission by asking this next theological question: **How did He respond to the suffering of His time?**\n- Answering this question will hopefully lead us to reflect on this other question which is closer to our experience: **Looking at what Jesus did, what do we do with the suffering of our own time?**\n- Generations of Ateneans have read this text that you're about to encounter. A lot of them have said that this reading has radically changed how they understand who Jesus is and what He stood for. So trust me when I say that you're in for a treat!\n- _**Brief Introduction of the Reading:**_ We seem to forget that Jesus came from a particular historical context. He is a Jewish man from first-century Palestine who dealt with the problems of His day. He was not a white man who dealt with European problems as He is often depicted. That is why Albert Nolan wants us to go back to the Jesus ‚Äúbefore Christianity‚Äù. He wants us to pay attention to the unique ways that Jesus responded to the problems of His time so that we can see how we ourselves can respond to those problems which still pervade today.\n### Suffering - From \"A Sacred Voice is Calling\"\n- To supplement your lessons for this module, let me show one of the most beautiful reflections on suffering I've ever read. I still get chills reading it.\n- _**Brief Introduction of the Reading**_\n\t- In this chapter taken from¬†_A Sacred Voice is Calling_, Neafsey talks about our capacity to be wounded healer's (which is actually a concept coming from Henri Nouwen) and how suffering also has a redemptive character as seen in the passion and death of Jesus.\n### Ministry to a Hopeless Man\n- For our last course reading, we will return to Fr. Henri Nouwen. This is the third chapter of his book¬†_The Wounded Healer_¬†(which is one of my personal favorites)¬†_._¬†In this chapter called \"Ministry to a Hopeless Man\", Nouwen talks about the need of entering the suffering of someone at the brink of death. The call to Christian leadership is one that is unafraid of suffering, willing to wait in both and life, and always eager to be in solidarity.\n- Enjoy! And may you be inspired to heal after reading this text.\n#### Supplementary Lecture\n- As a supplementary resource for this module, listen to this short talk about hope given by Fr. Michael Himes. He talks about how we can proceed with life hopefully even when things do not go our way. I invite you to watch the whole video, but the meat of the matter for our purposes begins at the 10-minute mark.\n- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF2gBVo7wdE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF2gBVo7wdE)\n\n## Biology of Science Fiction\n#BIO21i #biology #sciencefiction \n### ECOLOGY AND WORLDBUILDING\n#### Ecology: Actual and Speculative World-Building\n- **Ecology**¬†is the study of the ==interrelationships== between organisms and their environment. \n\t- So as you can imagine, any sci-fi work that endeavors to have some biological elements in its work should find basic ecological knowledge essential. \n\t- Also, it brings us back to the Red Queen Hypothesis, which says that populations have to keep evolving to survive alongside a changing environment. Full circle.\n- Here's the [lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmYA3QHu8rE) I gave during a synch session for last semester's class.\n\t- Four levels of ecology:\n\t\t- **Individual ecology**: you looking at an individual organism and how it interacts with the environment\n\t\t\t- E.G. individual's tolerance of changes in physical/chemical factors like sunlight, ph temperature, salinity, and nutrient levels\n\t\t\t- the individual ecology is very much tied with the species [[Cards/Niche]]\n\t\t\t- individual level ecology is also often called behavioral ecology because how an individual behavesin response to its environment is an important part of individual ecology\n\t\t- Population ecology\n\t\t\t- evolution happens at the population level\n\t\t\t- demographics (e.g. life expectancy, mortality rates, birth rates)\n\t\t\t- inter-species relationships (e.g. predation, parasitism, mutualism)\n\t\t- Community ecology\n\t\t\t- Population is a group of same species living together; a community is a group of different species...an assemblage of different species living together\n\t\t\t- E.G. coral reef\n\t\t- Ecosystems ecology\n\t\t\t- E.G. climate, nitrogen cycle...\n- And here's an [extension](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOgv05u58gs), which highlights community succession in relation to terraforming and using¬†_Dune_¬†as an example. Sandworms also make an appearance!\n\t- **Pioneer organisms/species:** the first to settleon a barren landscape and they are the ones that will prepare that environment for future organisms\n\t\t- Typically very simple organisms like bacteria\n\t- **Climax stage** of a community is where there are fe wdominant species (usually trees) and this is the state that the community will stay in for a very very long period of timeuntil a major disturbance disrupts the community and usually sets it back to zero\n\t- A disturbance is any discrete event that will kill off individuals in a community and will usually reset the community back to zero (e.g. floods, forest fires)\n\t- **Terraforming:** converting a non-living landscape into a living landscape -- a landscape that can sustain life\n\t- Core idea: **community succession**\n- Like I say at the end of the video, there's so much more to say about ecology. There's also climate and biodiversity; those are also ecological because they speak of the environment having an impact on living organisms and vice versa (the global temperature ain't just warming itself, no sir). Something ecological explains:\n\t- why humans, Cardassians, Klingons, and Romulans look different despite coming from the same [albeit very, very distant] ancestor;\n\t- why kaiju are so damn huge;\n\t- the whole plot of¬†_Nausica√§_, which we could have just as easily used as a reference for this Module as well;\n\t- how Eloi and Morlocks diverged from¬†_H. sapiens_;\n\t- why the Tlic's natural hosts gradually evolved to resist their parasitoid behavior, forcing them to use humans instead;\n\t- how MEV-1 transferred from bats and pigs to Gwyneth Paltrow;\n\t- what the idea of GMOs spreading into the wild and mingling with natural organisms kinda scary;\n\t- why the heptapods and the sandkings and the Moclans and all the other aliens we've encountered look and act the way they do; and\n\t- why the worlds of¬†_Dune_¬†or¬†_Alimuom_¬†or even¬†_Nausica√§_¬†may end up being our futures if we aren't more careful.\n- In case you haven't noticed, that's virtually all of the readings that we had this quarter! \n\t- Just a brief note on that last one: out of all the natural biomes on Earth, only one is expanding, and that is the desert. Human activities, particularly water extraction and habitat destruction, are destroying many ecosystems' capability to support life and turning them into wastelands. It's ecological disturbance on an unprecedented global scale. Will nature be able to bounce back and start fresh the way communities in succession do on a smaller scale?\n\n**Points for Discussion**\n1.  Explain in your own words the relationship between ecology and evolution.\n2. For each of the four levels of ecology, give an illustrative example from one of our texts in this course.\n3. What for you is the most critical ecological problem that the Earth is facing now? Why? Is there any way that science fiction can help us approach that problem?\n\n#### Political Ecology\n- The principle that underlies ecology is the same idea that makes fictional worldbuilding work: ==the systems that comprise the world are complex, multilayered, and intersect with each other in a variety of ways.== Often these intersections are experienced at the level of the individual--the climate and water cycle, for example, combine to give you the rainy day, while the rotation of the Earth and the clouds and the smog we release into the atmosphere give us what we know as a sunset.\n- When we use ecological principles to read worldbuilding, it might be helpful to apply this same idea of interconnectedness. In the real world, one framework that works this way is the idea of¬†**[[Political ecology]]:**¬†a framework that views ==society as an ecosystem==, with its parts relating to each other the way ecological factors do.\n- ![[Extras/Media/Images/Political ecology.png]]\n- The interconnectedness of our categorizations--our multiple identities as shaped by society as well as the social systems in which we are enmeshed, described by the framework known as¬†_intersectionality_--is not by any means a novel idea: we are very much ==products of the many overlapping systems== that make up the world in which we live, such as race, class, gender, disability, sexuality, and so on. \n\t- What political ecology does is look outward from that nexus of experience, and propose that ==our intersectional experience may be a reflection of the world as a whole, and that these different systems all intersect with and influence each other in the manner of an ecosystem.== \n\t- Ecology, politics, economy, and culture--as well as the abovementioned systems within them--interact on multiple levels, ranging from individual peoples' experiences to the way the world works.\n- Take politics and ecology. At the macro scale, our political decisions influence--and are influenced by--the environment in which we live: policies on carbon emissions and global warming, for example. \n\t- But at the level of individual countries, the Philippines, by virtue of where it is located, bears the brunt of worsening tropical storms and typhoons, forcing our government to make political decisions about disaster mitigation and response, even if we far less carbon and contributing far less to global warming than countries like the US and China. (This is not to say we shouldn't do our parts, of course, but we can only do so much, you know?) \n\t- And at the level of individual people's experience, these decisions affect our class suspensions, our jobs and livelihoods, the safety of the places we live, the food we eat--the whole shebang. \n\t- And this is all just today: ==think of the wealth of natural resources possessed by the developing world, and how this attracted the attention of colonial powers with power and weapons==; the history, culture, and politics of our country and many others like it, as shaped by colonial violence, can very much be traced back, in part, to the fact that we have nice stuff and they wanted to take it.\n- For another excellent look at how ecology and politics have shaped each other, check out this awesome [thread from Twitter](https://twitter.com/latifnasser/status/1323333293467525126) by Latif Nasser about another intersection of geography and politics: the relationship between the Cretaceous-era shoreline of North America and voting demographics in the United States, a relationship that has undoubtedly shaped US elections--and, thus, the politics of the world--for decades.\n- Put another way, ==this kind of interconnectedness has been present in speculative fiction--whether foregrounded or not--for centuries.== \n\t- In Greek myth, Gaea, the Earth Mother, and Ouranos, the Sky Father, are married, which was a clear allegory for the relationship between land and air, heaven and earth. \n\t- In¬†_Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri_, a computer game about humans trying to colonize a seemingly uninhabited alien planet, excessive ecological damage caused by human activity causes the native fungus fields to expel swarms of psychic worms that attack the human colonies (in¬†_Civilization_¬†terms, think of them as AI-controlled neutral barbarians, except they explicitly respond to environmental destruction, and also they burrow into people's flesh and lay eggs in their brains).\n\t- In¬†_Dune_, a text for this module (seriously, start reading it if you haven't), the spice melange is a substance found on the planet Arrakis, and with its use in everything from food to trade to clairvoyance to space travel, it represents immense potential political leverage, enough for the desert world to attract the attention of foreign colonizers who would otherwise have left it well alone. Except here, the WMDs are real, but nobody controls them and the \"W\" stands for \"worm.\" \n\t- And in James Cameron's¬†_Avatar_, the plants and animals of the planet Pandora have the ability to physically interface and communicate with each other, implying both a common evolutionary ancestor and the whole idea of interconnectedness itself.\n- From a literary perspective, that's really what ecology and worldbuilding are all about: ==interconnectedness==, the complex overlapping relationships that connect the elements of a fictional world in much the same way as the elements of our world and the facets of our society are connected. As we read our last set of texts for this semester--\"Process,\"¬†_Alimuom_,¬†_Dune_, and \"Microbiota and the Masses: A Love Story\"--we invite you to consider them as examples of interconnectedness, texts which use the science fiction¬†_novum_¬†to hyperbolize and make visible the ways in which our world is held together.\n\n#### **Nausica√§ of the Valley of the Wind**: Post-Apocalypse\n- Let's talk about kaiju.\n\t- There is a strand of Japanese literature that some scholars refer to as bomb literature (take a guess where that specific term comes from). The important thing to note here is that the bomb is used not just as a literal explosion or disaster, but as a ==narrative structure: a devastating event that forever divides life into a before and an after.==\n\t- The kaiju is a fascinating science fiction archetype, in large part because, while it is a category of creature, narratively speaking it tends to behave more as ==part of the setting== than as a type of character. \n\t\t- A kaiju is definitionally so large that it‚Äôs hard for regular human characters to interact with them in any way that‚Äôs meaningful for the kaiju‚Äîwe live around and in response to kaiju; they‚Äôre something a person survives rather than something a person fights. \n\t\t- When we call a kaiju a force of nature, that extends to their role in the narrative‚Äîin addition to often embodying nature‚Äôs wrath, or the power of something so vast as to be comparable to it (see: Godzilla as embodiment of the atom bomb), our conflicts with kaiju behave more like ==person-versus-environment conflicts== rather than person-versus-person texts.\n\t- The human response to kaiju, therefore, can be read as a way to talk about ==the ways humans respond to large-scale crises==; it‚Äôs no coincidence, after all, that kaiju movies often resemble disaster films. \n\t\t- Godzilla and King Kong are archetypal examples: the organized human response is a military one, where we respond to forces of nature with force of arms. \n\t\t- The Pacific Rim franchise provides an interesting twist, where kaiju are fought using giant jaeger robots that can only be piloted by drift-compatible humans capable of understanding each other on a deep and fundamental level‚Äîlove, it seems to say, is the only thing that lets us become big enough to cancel the apocalypse and fight the monsters on their own terms. \n\t\t- And in Dune, which we‚Äôll discuss later in the module, the sandworms are kaiju which our protagonist learns to ride‚Äîthe impossible monster is something you learn to use (if never completely taming it), and that act is how one asserts dominance over the world.\n- In some ways, the¬†_Ohm_¬†or¬†_Ohmu_¬†in¬†_Nausica√§ of the Valley of the Wind_¬†operate very similarly to traditional kaiju--in addition to being enormous fuck-off bugs, they're also sort of stand-ins for the person-versus-environment conflict at the heart of the film (although unlike most kaiju, the¬†_Ohmu_¬†retain the science fiction bug's characteristic of swarming). \n\t- The setting of the film is very much post-apocalyptic--and by \"post-\" we mean \"a thousand years after,\" but the text gives us a world with a very long memory, so who's counting--and the¬†_Ohmu_¬†are an integral part of that apocalypse, a visceral reminder that the old world is gone and a new one has been revealed. \n\t- And yet, the film is not a kaiju film, insofar as it also presents a hyperbolized environment distinct from (albeit connected to) the¬†_Ohmu--_the Toxic Jungle/Sea of Corruption, a living reminder of the devastation inflicted on the Earth by humankind in the history of this movie.\n- Design-wise, the¬†_Ohmu_¬†are another kind of estranged bug-based¬†_novum_, but their narrative function is both similar to and far different from the typical science fiction bug. For starters, they're not alien, and in fact ==seem deeply tied to nature and the ecosystem.== This has the strange consequence of making the¬†_Ohmu_¬†both more and less alien than typical¬†_kaiju_, giving them ==closer ties to the Earth== while also emphasizing ==how the Earth itself has become estranged from humanity== in the world of the text.\n- Jokes about¬†_King Kong_¬†aside, another way in which the¬†_Ohmu_¬†echo familiar¬†_kaiju_¬†tropes is the element of ==human connection, of bridging the gap between human and creature==, through the story of Nausica√§ herself. \n\t- While the¬†_Ohmu_¬†are known to Nausica√§ and the rest of humanity at the outset, the film (and the¬†_manga_) reflects her journey to attempt to understand and eventually form a bond with the creatures. \n\t- It's significant that at the beginning of the film, during her--and our--first up-close encounter with an¬†_Ohm_¬†(the dead one which she finds and whose eye she takes), we see that her attitude towards the creature has more caution and reverence than outright fear or revulsion. \n\t- While the dead¬†_Ohm_¬†is our first encounter with the species--signifying a world with a lot of history, but also a lot of history that is unknown to us--it is certainly not Nausica√§'s first, and yet she still regards it with the kind of wonder and respect that will come to be important in (and emblematic of) her future dealings with the¬†_Ohmu_.\n- Without spoiling anything (a reminder that your experience of these discussions and discussion boards will be much enhanced if you read the readings first), the¬†_Ohmu_¬†end up being very interesting figures from a semiotic standpoint: at once totally unlike typical¬†_kaiju_¬†and also archetypal representations of how¬†_kaiju_¬†function in a text. They are huge, powerful, enigmatic, meaning-rich, and cool as hell, and fine examples of how to create fun, interesting creatures that make sense and add weight to a story without needing to be fully explained.\n\nYou know what else doesn't need to be fully explained (but it would be cool)? Your possible answers to these **discussion prompts**! Answer any or all.\n1.  How does the¬†_Ohmu_'s design impact the plot and discourse of¬†_Nausica√§?_¬†Does it matter that they are¬†_kaiju_, bugs, or¬†_kaiju_¬†bugs?\n2.  Discuss¬†Nausica√§'s relationship with the¬†_Ohmu_¬†and how it develops throughout the film. How does it compare to the relationship between the¬†_Ohmu_¬†and the rest of humanity?\n3.  If you had to name the baby¬†_Ohmu_¬†(if you've watched the film, you know the one), what would you name it and why?\n4.  What sorts of organisms seem to have survived the ravaging of nature in this film's setting? From what we know of the real-life biology of their current counterparts (presumably their ancestors), why does this make sense?\n\n_**Ron's Notes:**_\n- Speaking of apocalypses, the future shown in¬†_Nausica√§_¬†is pretty scary from a biological perspective. \n\t- Even in our current times, many biologists believe that we are in the middle of the ==sixth mass extinction event== that the 4.6-billion-year-old planet has seen (the fifth one was the \"K-Pg Extinction\" event 66 million years ago, which is well-known because it wiped out all non-avian dinosaurs, among many other species of life). \n\t- This is the general belief because the rate of extinction of species in the last 100 years has exceeded the extinction rate normally seen over¬†_thousands_¬†of years. Unlike the five mass extinction events that preceded it, this is the ==only one that's caused primarily by the planet-altering activities of one species.== Any guesses on what that species is? Not bad for one that's been around for only around 200,000 years!\n- There are five major causes of biodiversity loss or extinction in the world:¬†**pollution**,¬†**overexploitation of living resources**,¬†**climate change**,¬†**habitat loss**, and¬†**invasive species**. \n\t- As you may imagine, these five ==don't necessarily have to be mutually exclusive.== For example, overexploitation of forest trees for lumber is a primary cause of habitat loss, air pollution has been a cause of climate change, and wildlife trade (which is a form of exploitation) has caused the proliferation of invasive species.\n- Assuming that¬†_Nausica√§_¬†shows Earth in the future (making it an example of the \"Dying Earth\" subgenre of dystopic sci-fi),¬†_**which of the five drivers of extinction could have played a major role in shaping that future?**_¬†If you think about it from that context,¬†_Nausica√§_¬†becomes a cautionary tale about how we're living our lives at the present despite being set many, many years forward in time.\n- Remember what we said about sci-fi speaking more of the present than of the future?\n\n#### **Alimuom**: I Need Some Space\n- Keith Sicat‚Äôs¬†_Alimuom_¬†is a Filipino science fiction movie built around hyperbolizing a deceptively simple premise: ==what if the soil became too toxic for agriculture?== \n\t- The film builds a world around answering this question, giving us high-concept takes on familiar topics‚ÄîOFWs, anti-government insurgency, and my personal favorite, shitty state bureaucracy‚Äîthat combine into a setting that is at once far-flung and deeply familiar.\n- Our POV character as we wade through this world is Diwata Encarnacion, a young college teacher in a long-distance marriage with an OFW (outerspace Filipino worker) stationed around Jupiter, with whom she has a son she is essentially raising without the husband she can only afford to call on select occasions. But Diwata is more than a wife and mother: she is the daughter of a botanist embittered by poor treatment from the government, and she has a long-lost sister whom she misses dearly. \n\t- It is this network of relationships that weigh on and drive Diwata through the film‚Äôs main plot‚Äîher involvement with a government effort to identify mutated seedlings that seem to exist in defiance of both the country‚Äôs toxic soil and the national ban on agriculture enacted in response to it.\n- Given all this, Diwata kind of has to be an interesting protagonist to be able to hold all these disparate threads together, and she establishes herself as such within minutes of her first meeting with her would-be employer from the Department of Agriculture. She‚Äôs rightfully suspicious and perhaps even a little embittered‚Äîthe society in which she lives has deeply hurt her father, kept her husband lightyears away, and given her students who seem to want for themselves the same life she resents‚Äîbut that doesn‚Äôt stop her from being driven and take-charge as hell. Diwata is a ==true science fiction character==‚Äîa young Filipino professional willing and able to assert her worth, even to the government‚Äîand every time it seems like the plot might railroad her into the next story beat, she takes charge of the narrative and gets there herself.\n- Diwata's arc throughout the film, as with any good social science fiction work, gives her--and us--a taste of how society in this quasi-post-apocalyptic Philippines works; we see both how the government works and how it affects people on the ground. That society is messed up is hardly a surprise--something common to both the Filipino experience and typical dystopian fiction, whose aesthetics and sensibility the film invokes pretty blatantly--but what is a surprise is the degree to which society has failed, and in what ways. We never see every aspect of how this world works, but we do see the ==intertwining of personal life with social policy== that both makes this fictional Philippines feel real and lived-in as well as helps our minds speculate about the parts we're not seeing. You never need to present the whole world; you just need to show a cross-section that feels real enough for the audience to help you fill in the gaps on their own.\n- Part of what makes Alimuom such an intriguing film is that, apart from the through-line of Diwata herself, some notable scenes seem at first glance to not connect to the overarching plot. Diwata‚Äôs long-distance marriage never links up with her government job, plot-wise, and there‚Äôs an odd scene in the middle of the movie involving Diwata, her close friend who only exists in this one scene and nowhere else in the film, and a spider-themed dancer whose performance needs to be seen to be believed. While the film does give us a cohesive central plot that does resolve itself by the end, the question of what the film is actually about requires us to consider everything it presents us, even the subplots and scenes that don‚Äôt seem to relate to the main plot in a literal way.\n- And yet, perhaps such a structure really is the most honest way to tackle the subjects that¬†_Alimuom_¬†is trying to tackle--both as a science fiction film and as a Filipino science fiction film. \n\t- A film about terraforming is necessarily a film about ecology, and the logic of ecology--myriad systems and elements all interconnected and interdependent--is ==not a logic that can be captured in a straightforward narrative arc.== (It's why the¬†_Avatar_¬†movies are the way they are.) \n\t- And this reflects the Filipino experience too: our lives, like Diwata's, exist at the nexus points of dozens of relationships and histories, both personal and national, and sometimes the story that needs to be told is the story about ==attempting to acknowledge and navigate that complexity. ==Perhaps that's what it really means to survive in the future, this film suggests, and maybe that's all terraforming ultimately is: ==a reckoning with complexity, and an attempt to make it work for good.==\n\n1.  What aspects of Philippine society do you see reflected in¬†_Alimuom_? How have they been hyperbolized, and why do you think they have been hyperbolized in this way?\n2.  What do you make of how the film ends? Why do you think Diwata makes the choices she makes, and do you agree with them? Why or why not?\n3.  _Alimuom_¬†is really, really horny. What's up with that?\n\n#### **Planet-Size X-Men**: Here Comes Tomorrow\n- _Planet-Size X-Men_¬†#1 is not an especially complicated story--it has grand proportions and enormous stakes, yes, but the sequence of events is quite simple. \n\t- On the face of it, it's a story about a powerful group of superhumans trying to terraform Mars, turning it into a living world and a home for their warlike, isolationist brethren. \n\t- On another level, it's a story about politics and problem-solving, creativity in the face of seemingly impossible problems of geography, territory, and nation. \n\t- And on still another level, it's a story about ==unity and collaboration==--a theme in the current¬†_X-Men_¬†run, as you may have noticed while reading¬†_HOXPOX_--and about ==what marginalized people can accomplish if they work together.==\n- The comic opens strangely: with the image of asteroids in space, the expanse of the Milky Way beautifully framed behind them, and a pair of questions being asked. We do not see the asker or their audience, so while they are being spoken in the world of the text, it initially seems as though the questions are directed towards us, a provocative inquiry in the face of the seemingly lifeless void.\n- These questions are what¬†_Planet-Size X-Men_¬†#1 is about, both in a literal sense--the logistics of superpowered terraforming--and in a thematic sense: ==what kind of work does it take, metaphorically speaking, for ideas to become real?== Terraforming Mars has been one of the big dreams of science fiction for decades now, and for a work of contemporary science fiction to so boldly take it on--and using characters who typically inhabit stories about oppression and hate and fear--is ambitious in more ways than one.\n- It also has to be said, before we go much further, that this issue probably isn't a story that you can read according to the rules of traditional Western fiction. By those conventions, it's nothing special--there's no real conflict, merely a problem to be solved, and the completion of the solution goes off entirely without a hitch. I would suggest, then, that perhaps this story is best read as a ==piece concerned with tone and ideas==: in telling us a story, it attempts to present grandiose science fiction concepts as well as evoke a sense of wonder and awe. \n\t- What escalates as the narrative goes on is not tension or danger, but scope; the narrative progression of the story gives us the unfolding of the big plan, almost like a heist movie, as well as the text's bombastic, comic-book hyperbolization of the scientific concepts necessary to make the plan happen. \n\t- This is, in many ways, ==the science fiction version of a creation story== (which feels especially fitting considering the boast of Magneto, himself one of the Omega-level mutants involved in the terraforming project and seemingly its chief proponent, at the end of¬†_House of X_¬†#1).\n\t- Was this line a sign of hubris on Magneto's part? Absolutely. (This is part of why I love Magneto.) But in many ways,¬†_Planet-Size X-Men_¬†#1 sits in conversation with this line, narratively paying off Magneto's hubris by showing that, on some level, given the power that he and the other Omegas wield--in particular, the power to create life and shape worlds, which we have always historically viewed as the realm of the divine--the hubris is at least somewhat justified.\n- On the subject of superhuman abilities, one small line of dialogue in¬†_Planet-Size X-Men_¬†#1 fascinates me. I haven't talked much about the Arakki yet--suffice it to say they're a proud, ancient, mutant culture that has only recently been reintroduced to the wider world after going through thousands of years of suffering--but they serve both a narrative purpose and a thematic purpose in¬†_Planet-Size_, continuing the theme of this being a story about ideas. For starters, it's important that the Arakki, whose future is being decided by this comic, have a part to play in making their future happen, because otherwise the Krakoans end up looking¬†_very_¬†white-savior-ish. But beyond that, when Isca the Unbeaten, whose power is literally to never lose, introduces the Arakki mutants who will be helping the terraforming effort, the way she speaks of their powers¬†_vis-a-vis_¬†how Magneto speaks of them is certainly food for thought, and speaks volumes about how these cultures view themselves (and, likewise, about the depth of the pain embedded in Arakki culture).\n\t- _Planet-Size_¬†isn't particularly interested in vindicating either view, but it does invite us to think about the implications of the words we use. ==When we survive trauma and oppression, do we view our abilities as¬†_gifts_, or as¬†_weapons_?== And in a setting where mutant powers are metaphorical stand-ins for the conditions of marginalization, in a story where those same powers are used to turn a dead world in a living one, is reality then being shaped by¬†_gifts,_¬†or by¬†_weapons_?\n- _Planet-Size X-Men_¬†#1 is a story about how the geography and ecology of Mars--now Planet Arakko--are ==remade by people whose trauma and oppression are inextricably linked to the abilities they use to reshape a planet.== \n\t- There is something incredibly political there--==how marginalized people use the things that cause them to be marginalized to reshape their world and create spaces for people like themselves==--but also something deeply, profoundly hopeful. \n\t- Politics and terraforming have a lot in common, in that they are ultimately rooted in ==imagining a better world and making it happen==; they're about possibility, and about the work that goes into making it real. \n\t- And¬†_Planet-Size X-Men_¬†#1, a relatively simple story with big stakes and bigger ideas, reminds us that everyone has that spark of possibility in them, that the things that mark us as¬†_Other_¬†can also be what allow us to change the world, and that sometimes, the only way to find out is to roll up our sleeves and try.\n\n**Discussion**¬†**Points**\n1.  Did you have a favorite part of this story?\n2.  Talk about the Arakki vis-a-vis the Krakoans. What differences and similarities did you notice with regard to their culture, their powers, or their appearances? Did you think these were significant from a thematic perspective?\n3.  How did reading this comic make you feel?\n\n#### **Dune**: May His Passing Cleanse The World\n- _Dune_¬†¬†by Frank Herbert is one of the classic science fiction stories that you absolutely have to talk about when you speak of ==science fiction, ecology, and politics.== \n\t- As previously mentioned, it's the story of Paul Atreides, the scion of House Atreides, as he and his family come to the desert planet of Arrakis and fall afoul of the villainous House Harkonnen. Paul must contend with the various forces on Arrakis--from the local Fremen to the mysterious Bene Gesserit order to the massive sandworms that roam the sands--to come into his power, defeat the bad guys, and make Arrakis a better place.\n- But before we talk about Paul Atreides, we have to talk about the ==spice melange.== \n\t- The spice is an extremely potent substance produced by the sandworms which is highly prized within the Empire to which House Atreides and House Harkonnen belong, having uses ranging from narcotics to trade to granting psionic powers to powering spaceflight. \n\t- The spice is seen as the main reason the Empire has an interest in Arrakis, and it is part of why House Harkonnen betrays and attacks House Atreides when the latter arrive--Harkonnen's desire to keep the spice under their domain is what leaves Paul fatherless, sends him into the desert, and touches off the inciting conflict of the book.\n![[Extras/Media/Images/Hero Journey.png]]\n- Paul is a ==messiah figure== in every sense of the word: he is someone cast out of society and into the (literal) desert and chosen by a disempowered people, the Fremen, as their leader and savior. \n\t- His narrative is an archetypal hero's journey, described by Joseph Campbell as the¬†_monomyth_--==the story of someone inherently noble who is laid low, rises to prominence from a position of weakness while growing in character, confronting evil, saving his people, and establishing a new status quo.== It's a pattern we see in myths the world over, and it's a powerful story that resonates with many of us, partly because it's so familiar. We see stories like this and we think,¬†_good person_; we think,¬†_hero_.\n- But one thing we have to remember is that a messiah is not just a hero in the abstract sense; ==a messiah is a hero with¬†_context_. ==\n\t- A messiah is a savior of a people, which implies that there is something from which these people need to be saved; both the marginalized and the one they choose to save them are products of the world that causes their suffering to begin with. Arrakis is a harsh desert world with little water and less compassion--to the Empire of which Paul is a part (admittedly a relatively nicer part), the one thing that matters here is the spice melange and what it represents. \n\t- This is, in every sense of the word, a ==colonized world==--one seen mainly as a resource depot, and one whose image as a resource depot has caused it to be subjected to colonial power. And the sandworm is the ultimate expression of this: a vast and wondrous creature viewed purely as a threat and a resource generator, even if there is so much more of it literally beneath the surface.\n- Paul's taming of the sandworm, then, is the one act that symbolizes what his role as a messiah is (and, indeed, the role of all messiah figures): ==the ability to reckon with the forces of his world and break or bend them to liberate their ‚Äúchosen people‚Äù== (i.e. the people who choose them). \n\t- He bears the name of Atreides, the power of the Bene Gesserit and the Kwisatz Haderach, the loyalty of the Fremen, and the ability to tame the embodiment of the world itself, and he ends the book defeating House Harkonnen, the archetypal enemy--not with words or compassion, but with violence and a Fremen¬†_jihad_. \n\t- ==A messiah is necessarily a product of their time, place, context, and believers,== and Arrakis has ensured that for Paul, all the things that shape him are harsh, brutal, and unforgiving.\n- Another thing the text highlights about messiah stories is their nature as stories: that is, as ==things that are¬†_constructed_.== \n\t- This is encapsulated in the Bene Gesserit, who for all their mysticism and special powers are also explicitly described to wield great political influence. \n\t- The Kwisatz Haderach is not merely a messiah whom they¬†_believe_¬†will arrive; they also have a dedicated breeding program aimed at¬†_causing_¬†them to be born. \n\t- The Lady Jessica, in her role as wife to Duke Leto Atreides and mother to Paul, is being a good spouse and mother, but she is also fulfilling a role, playing her own part in the cultivation of a narrative that takes on the shape of something sacred while ultimately being engineered by human minds for human ends.\n- The thing we need to remember is this: a messiah story is not necessarily the story of a good person, but the story of a¬†_hero_, a¬†_protagonist_. \n\t- As we've seen by now, protagonists don't have to be good people; they're just the people about whom the story is written. \n\t- And the story of a messiah is often the story of a marginalized, downtrodden, suffering people in need of a hero to represent, lead, and save them. \n\t- The Fremen choose Paul Atreides, just as the novel¬†_Dune_¬†focuses on Paul Atreides, but we have to remember that Paul--and by extension all of House Atreides--is a colonizer too. They're nice people and they certainly do good things--one might even call them good people--but they, too, come to Arrakis as participants in the system of exploitation that mines it for spice for the Empire while largely ignoring the Fremen. \n\t- Whether Paul can truly \"go native\" is up for debate (and we have to remember he's still a young man), but by the time we see the adulation directed his way by the end of the book, having vanquished the archetypal \"bad guys,\" the tone of the text should make it clear: this is not an uncomplicated happy ending.\n- A messiah narrative comes from a people who view themselves as oppressed, and consequently such a story reflects a desire to be saved from an impossible world. Arrakis is an archetypal example of such an impossible world, and so¬†_Dune_¬†is the story of Paul as he becomes the Dune Messiah: he represents and can master all the powers of the world--economic, political,  martial, mystical, natural--and he begins his messiah journey through violence and the desert, which is perfectly in line with what Arrakis has become, a harsh, barren world torn apart by power and those who hoard it. \n\t- And a messiah who is part of that same ecosystem--and not even truly of the people he purports to lead and save--may not be able to see it for what it is, what it looks like from below and within, and so may simply reproduce it in his attempt to end it. \n\t- ==Oppression is just as much of a cycle as water and air,== and if¬†_Dune_¬†is about anything--other than sick-ass giant worms--this is probably what it wants to talk about: ==the damage wrought by the great beast of empire as it tunnels through the world, ruining and remaking it and those who live there in its wake.==\n\n**Discussion Points**\n1.  Pick a faction involved in¬†_Dune_¬†and talk about them. What is their stake in Arrakis? What do the planet and the spice mean to them? How do they behave in relation to each other?\n2.  Discuss the desert as a sign. What meanings does the desert signify, in¬†_Dune_¬†and in other texts as well? What then do we associate with water (and its absence), and with the spice?\n3.  What does the sandworm signify?\n4.  Discuss how the evolutionary arms race plays out on Arrakis.\n\n#### **\"Microbiota and the Masses\"**: Remediation\n- We've come to the end of our course, and we thought we'd come full circle and send you guys off in style--with a story that's a little bit about first encounters, a little bit about quarantine, and a little bit about bioremediation. Let's talk about S.B. Divya's¬†**\"Microbiota and the Masses: A Love Story.\"**\n- Divya's story follows protagonist Moena Sivaram, a famously orphaned heiress and brilliant scientist who meets and falls in love with Rahul Madhavan, an engineer who comes to Moena's home to repair her broken SmartWindow. Moena is a bubble girl in every sense of the word, her social isolation from growing up rich in India's caste-driven society being mirrored and hyperbolized in the text by the physical isolation of her living conditions. While Moena used to live a relatively normal (if privileged) life, the deaths of her parents in the accident that made her a household name and the onset of the risk of chronic illness triggered a huge change in Moena's status quo: she now lives in a smart house, a tightly controlled artificial biome, in order to preserve her own health and safety. Consequently, Moena begins the story as a shut-in, being almost obsessively fastidious about avoiding infection from outside elements, never stepping outside her home, and wearing an isolation suit whenever she's around other people. (Yeah, yeah, we know it's unrealistic--it's science fiction, after all.)\n- But Rahul opens a crack in Moena's walls, both literally, as a visitor to her home, and figuratively--he's the first person Moena has seen face-to-face in months, even if he hasn't seen her actual face thanks to her isolation suit, and this awakens in Moena a desire for more. (Plus, Rahul is hot and she's thirsty as hell.) And so, in true romantic fashion, Moena fashions a new identity for herself as \"Meena,\" wanting to get closer to Rahul without the burden of her name attached, and she starts stepping outside to work with him on a volunteer effort to rehabilitate the massively polluted Agara Lake. As the story unfolds, the narrative of the lake bioremediation project is interwoven with the development of Moena's and Rahul's relationship, and the nature of the contamination ties it to Moena‚Äôs health as well.\n- _**Ron's Note:**_\n\t- Just a quick note on¬†**bioremediation**. This is a branch of biotechnology that involves ==using organisms or products derived from them (e.g. enzymes, unique compounds, etc.) to rehabilitate ecosystems that have been damaged by human activities==, usually (but not limited to) pollution. \n\t- Bacteria are usually the agents used, although fungi are also known bioremediators. \n\t- Most bioremediation has been done to clean up oil spills or contaminated groundwater but may also be used to remove toxins and other contaminants from both terrestrial and aquatic environments. \n\t- It works on the principle of certain organisms being able to utilize these harmful compounds, breaking them down into relatively harmless compounds that they can use for their metabolism, or at least accumulating them in their body tissues. \n\t- As you probably know, plastic-degrading bacteria are being studied for their potential for cleaning plastic pollution in bodies of water. \n\t- And as you can imagine, genetically engineering microbes to become capable agents of bioremediation is a legitimate biotechnological application, and, by virtue of seeking to reverse the worst ecological effects of human activities, certainly one of the most hopeful and beneficent.\n![[Extras/Media/Images/Political ecology example.png]]\n- Moena is an excellent example of a character deeply rooted in her setting and her environment--a political-ecology-inflected reading of her would look at all the ways in which the greater systems that shape her context are at work within her immediate surroundings and her setting.\n\t- **Isolation**¬†is a big theme for her: she is othered from her environment, her country, and other people multiple times over, her privilege and health represented by the walls of her home and her suit, and so Moena's desire for Rahul is also a desire to break through those barriers, something she first attempts by trying to become someone else. \n\t- And because the health of Moena's home is so directly tied to that of her body, and her relationship with Rahul is in turn directly tied to their work with Lake Agara, we see Moena's health and personal biome change and progress as she gets more and more entangled with Rahul as the story progresses.\n- The story is very much a romantic one--I hesitate to call it \"rom-com-like,\" but it certainly displays many classic romcom tropes: the meet-cute, the overblown conceit of the false identity, the heartbreak when the ruse is discovered, the big romantic gesture and reconciliation at the end. But the love story is also subversive in many ways: it centers and normalizes female romantic agency and sexual desire, allows Moena to be an upper-class female romantic lead and active pursuer of a middle-class guy (in India!), and exists in conversation with multiple other narrative threads that actually matter to the text rather than simply being excuses to progress the love story.\n- But at the end of the day, this is a love story (the title even says so). ==Love is necessarily an encounter with other-ness, the choice to allow that other-ness to change you, even at the risk of contamination or harm.== \n\t- When Moena says \"I've been infected by a man,\" she is referring to multiple things at once: her sexual desire for Rahul that will later blossom into love, him opening her up to the idea of using her research to help her polluted country, the very literal infection she risks from pursuing these things, and the thought that perhaps that danger might be worth it. \n\t- Rahul and Lake Agada mirror each other in their roles in Moena‚Äôs life: they are the things from which she is isolated lest they infect her, and yet which offer her in that very risk the opportunity for growth and change.\n- Because ultimately, ==both bioremediation and love are acts of hope.== \n\t- They require that we come to terms with the past--the traumas and contaminants that make life unliveable--and open ourselves up to imagining a different future. In introducing foreign organisms into a lifeless environment, Moena reckons with Lake Agada‚Äôs pollution in a similar way to how she reckons with herself, her heart which she describes as parched for company. \n\t- Love and bioremediation are rooted in hope, and I think if we want to leave you guys with anything at the end of this semester, it's hope. It's the idea that the other can be as beautiful and life-giving as it is scary, the belief that even the most polluted lake and the deepest wounds and the most insurmountable barriers can be remade, and the faith that, while evolution is chaotic and undirected and often utterly terrifying, perhaps we really can adapt to anything.\n- _**Ron's Note:**_\n\t- \"Because ultimately, both bioremediation and love are acts of hope.\" Couldn't have said it better myself. In ecology, \"hope\" can be seen in the characteristic of a community (multiple species living together, like a coral reef) called¬†**resilience**, which is the ==ability of the community to bounce back from a disturbance.== \n\t- Bioremediation is a biotechnological way of supplementing a community's natural resilience...just as love helps make us more resilient individuals.\n\t- I'd argue that terraforming is also an act of hope, making hope a central theme of this Module :)\n\n**Discussion¬†¬†Points**\n1.  Talk about one facet of Moena's identity and how it relates to her personal biome, health, and research.\n2.  Talk about Rahul and how he acts as a foil to Moena and to Lake Agada itself.\n3.  Do you agree (with Ron) that terraforming is also an act of hope? Why or why not?\n\n#### Creature Spotlight: Sentient Ecosystems\n- The 1950 short story \"Process\" by A. E. van Vogt is one of a long line of works that, seemingly, progresses largely independent of anything we would normally refer to as characters. \n\t- We're often taught that fiction is about plot and character, that the former is ultimately about us following the journey of the latter, but some works of fiction seem to deliberately subvert that formulation. \n\t- One of the most famous ones is \"There Will Come Soft Rains\" by Ray Bradbury, a science fiction short story about a \"smart house\" that runs on a programmed daily schedule and automated robotic routines, and continues to do so even in the seeming absence of the house's occupants. \n\t- \"Process\" puts a biological spin on a similar conceit, focusing on what seems to be a sapient forest with a hive mind consciousness as it responds to the arrival of a ship from beyond the world it knows.\n- \"Process\" invites us to reconsider our idea of what a character¬†_is_. While the arriving ship is piloted, we never get into the headspace of these ship-using beings, never once experience the story from their point of view. We know they have goals--the extraction of resources, first and foremost, followed by survival when the forest fights against them--but these are never treated as the main driving force of the text. And conversely, the forest in which they arrive--something that we would normally refer to as the setting of this story--is given not only the central point of view in the text, but a sense of will, agency, desire, and response to conflict, all traits we would usually associate with the more \"humanoid\" creatures in a text. ==It is the forest's goals, rather than those of the ship-users, that drive this story forward.==\n- The trope of the sentient location is not a new one in science fiction. \n\t- We see it in works ranging from Marvel and DC's Ego the Living Planet and Mogo the Green Lantern planet to the Lovecraftian Shimmer-influenced woods of¬†_Annihilation_¬†(a really good movie based on a really good book, excellent enough that I, Sir AJ, noted scaredy-cat, am recommending it despite it having some intense body horror, something I usually can't stand). \n\t- And while it's easy to oversimplify this idea, either through treating the intelligent location as nothing more than an incredibly large but otherwise normal character or through reducing it to a simplistic example of how the world is alive, I think works like \"Process\" are a good opportunity to go beyond this level of reading and really dig into how we conceive of the notion of character--and, for that matter, how we conceive of people.\n- The obvious: we assume a character is a single living entity with a single body, but a sentient location such as the forest in \"Process,\" with its many trees and creepers, consists of multiple bodies, and yet it still refers to itself using singular pronouns, as a single being. \n\t- The text asserts that ==a shared consciousness that exists among multiple bodies can, in fact, be considered a single character==--and, indeed, why should our single-bodied mode of existence be the only mode we consider \"normal?\" \n\t- Furthermore, as we are reminded by the prophet Osmosis Jones, ==the human body itself consists of many living organisms, including but not limited to the decidedly non-human bacteria that live in our gut, and yet we consider ourselves singular beings too--we, too, are legion.==\n- Another device this story calls into question is ==point of view==--specifically, the choice of whose point of view to center. \n\t- In a story with beings in a starship and a sentient forest, our expectation is that the main characters are the people in the ship, largely because this is the experience closer to how we imagine our own experience to be. We are used to our experience being repeated back to us by the texts we consume--I think the kids call this \"relatability.\" \n\t- But \"Process\" deliberately defamiliarizes the more \"human-like\" perspective; we only ever see the beings in the ship through the eyes of the forest, and meanwhile the experience that is foregrounded is the one more alien to us, more unfamiliar. The text reminds us of ==our own tendency to foreground the more familiar perspective==, reducing the voice of the other to \"setting\" when we cannot see enough of ourselves in it, never mind that our definition of character might be more limited than we are comfortable admitting\n- \"Process\" is a deceptively simple story told in an unconventional way: a story of adventure into the unknown, told from the perspective of the unknown. \n\t- It's a story about a consciousness that is at once very different from ours and quietly similar, and the ways in which that kind of consciousness responds to people more like us as they do the things that we would do in that situation. \n\t- But ultimately--as with everything human beings write--it is very much ==a story about people, and the ways in which we believe all stories are about us, and what happens to the voices pushed to the periphery of our narratives as a result.==\n\n**Discussion¬†Points**\n1.  What is the importance of the ship-users' goal to the text and what it is trying to communicate? Why does it matter that this, specifically, is what they've come to this world to do?\n2.  Semiotically, how does a living ecosystem differ as a narrative device from a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù character who has total control of nature?\n3.

It‚Äôs their feelings in these situations that may be considered narcissistic injuries. Rather than express vulnerability and reveal how they feel, they may react with defiance, arguments, and even a¬†[narcissistic rage attack](https://psychcentral.com/disorders/narcissistic-personality-disorder/narcissistic-collapse/).\n\t\t\t\t\t- Mom definitely has rage attacks\n\t\t\t- Example responses: gaslighting, silent treatment, arguments\n\t\t\t- Root causes: abuse or neglect during childhood, unrealistic parental expectations, excessive pampering and praise from parents, narcissistic parent or parents\n\t\t- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic_injury\n\t\t\t- Another definition: ==emotional trauma== that overwhelms an individual's defense mechanisms and devastates their pride and self-worth. In some cases the ==shame== or disgrace is so significant that the individual can never again truly feel good about who they are and this is sometimes referred to as a \"narcissistic scar\"\n\t\t\t\t- [[Cards/Self-rejection]]\n\t\t\t- Narcissists are often¬†[pseudo-perfectionists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfectionism_(psychology) \"Perfectionism (psychology)\")¬†and create situations in which they are the center of attention. The narcissist's attempts at being seen as perfect are necessary for their grandiose¬†[self-image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-image \"Self-image\"). If a perceived state of perfection is not reached, it can lead to¬†[guilt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guilt_(emotion) \"Guilt (emotion)\"),¬†[shame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shame \"Shame\"),¬†[anger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anger \"Anger\")¬†or¬†[anxiety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety \"Anxiety\")¬†because the subject believes that they will lose the admiration and love of other people if they are imperfect. ==Because some children are raised to believe that love is conditional, obsession with being perfect becomes routine for them.== As a result, when failing in any aspect of life, the child will feel as if they are no longer accepted, causing a narcissistic injury. Examples of reasons why children would show narcissistic injury due to perfectionism include failing exams, losing in competitions, being denied acceptance, disagreement in conversation with others, and constructive criticism.¬†\n\t\t\t\t- [[Cards/Perfectionism]]\n\t\t\t\t- [[Cards/The False Self]]\n- Black Swan (Nina as Narcissus)\n\t- [Weeping for Narcissus](https://lechatdargent.wordpress.com/2011/02/14/weeping-for-narcissus-a-review-of-black-swan/)\n\t\t- The essence of narcissistic injury is this: a person naturally grows their own sense of who they are, and seeks love and approval from important others. ==The narcissistic injury occurs when the important others attack that home-grown sense of self, and demand that an external standard be achieved instead.== So, natural sense of self is rejected as sub-standard; external sense of what self should be is imposed.\n\t\t\t- [[Cards/The False Self]] v.s. [[Cards/The True Self]]\n\t\t- Consequently, the narcissistic injury drives a ==perfectionism== that is un-natural (because it doesn‚Äôt actually fit with what the person wants ‚Äòin their heart of hearts‚Äô), and can never be satisfied (because the external standard is alien, so any success can‚Äôt truly be felt as belonging to self).\n\t\t\t- [[Cards/Perfectionism]]\n\t\t- In the Greek myth, the beautiful young man¬†Narcissus¬†is cursed by the Gods to fall in love with his own reflection; but he doesn‚Äôt know he is in love with his reflection, he takes his reflection to be another person. That is the tragedy of ==narcissistically driven ambition==; the person who is so driven doesn‚Äôt realise they are chasing their own reflection, which they are doomed never to attain, however successful they are.\n\t\t- Applied to Nina, her injury is clear; she needs to be the Swan Queen to feel worthwhile because, in her narcissistically driven emotional reality, there are only two categories: ==perfection and worthlessness.== Incidentally, this dichotomy of perfection and worthlessness plays itself out well between Nina and Beth; the former‚Äôs star rising as the latter‚Äôs descends.\n\t\t\t- A binary way of seeing the world... [[Cards/Absolute Certainty versus Wonder]]\n\t\t- The influence of Nina‚Äôs mother sits heavily in the background, and it is striking that the film doesn‚Äôt make an overly big deal out of this.

Consider that as an ==emotional reality; one in which people only exist in the context of your own goals.== That is part of the trap of narcissistic relating; Nina only ever relates to her own reflection, never the actual people she meets. That is true not only of the other girls in the company, but also director Thomas, and Nina‚Äôs mother; the two people whose approval Nina so desperately seeks.\n\t\t\t- Related to the [[Cards/Ressentiment]] I experience?\n\t\t- Consequently, it isn‚Äôt possible for Nina to receive human nourishment because at no point is she in contact with another person; she relates only to her own reflection. And reflection is a great way of explaining what happens when we project unwanted aspects of ourselves onto others; the other becomes a pool of water, upon the surface of which we see something of ourselves without recognising it as such. In a sense, ==all projection could be considered Narcissistic.==\n\t\t\t- [[Cards/Ressentiment]]...I am projecting onto the people I envy\n\t\t- I feel more able to weep for Narcissus; trapped as he is in a world of his own reflections, driven further and further into isolation by his need to attain perfection.\n\t- [Aronofsky‚Äôs¬†Black Swan¬†as a Postmodern Fairy Tale: Mirroring a Narcissistic Society](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0787/10/3/86)\n\t\t- Both Freudians and Jungians designate an individual‚Äôs perceiving a repressed aspect of the self in another as a projection: ‚Äúif people observe their own unconscious tendencies in other people, this is called a projection ([von Franz 1991, p. 37](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0787/10/3/86#B41-humanities-10-00086)).‚Äù Jung described this shadow as an inferiority that individuals may wish to ‚Äúescape,‚Äù by ‚Äúlooking for everything dark, inferior and culpable in others ([Jung 1970, p. 203](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0787/10/3/86#B17-humanities-10-00086))‚Äù. As William Miller (1991, p. 39) states, ‚ÄúProjection is an unconscious mechanism that is employed whenever a trait or characteristic of our personality that has no relation to consciousness becomes activated. As a result of the unconscious projection, we observe and react to this unrecognized personal trait in other people. We see in them something that is part of ourselves, but which we fail to see in ourselves.‚Äù Furthermore, ‚Äú‚Ä¶anytime our response to another person involves excessive emotion or overreaction, we can be sure that something unconscious has been prodded and is being activated (Miller 1991, p. 40)\n\t\t\t- [[Authenticity]] and [[Cards/Brokenness]]: shadow self\n\t\t\t- [[Cards/Ressentiment]]\n\t\t- Psychoanalyst¬†[West-Leuer](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0787/10/3/86#B42-humanities-10-00086)¬†([2017, p. 1240](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0787/10/3/86#B42-humanities-10-00086)) claims that Nina has a narcissistic personality with a ‚Äúperfectionist ideal-ego‚Äù that ‚Äúexpects achievement, self-control, and functionality\n\t\t- The chief sign of the pursuit of perfection is obsession.

What Aronofsky has to say about the fractured narcissistic psyche seems to apply in a more general sense.¬† What does it really take¬†(psychologically speaking) to be an elite artist/performer?¬† What kind of person would sign up¬†for¬†that?¬† And would we all really want to be inside that headspace?\n\t\t\t- In¬†_The Red Shoes_,¬†Julian is distinctly desexualized, and the¬†force countering the pursuit of¬†Vicky‚Äôs art is¬†romantic love and a future with marriage and a family. ¬†In contrast, Thomas¬†unapologetically links sex to Nina‚Äôs performance (on and off the stage), and¬†==Nina is bound by the demands of her own False Self and¬†confined to a self-imposed state of arrested development.==¬† If¬†_The Red Shoes_¬†questions the effect of¬†the relentless pursuit of artistic¬†ambition on an otherwise talented and emotionally healthy person,¬†_Black Swan_¬†challenges its underlying assumption¬†in the context of¬†a¬†much larger world ‚Äì that is,¬†==_can a talented and emotionally healthy¬†person being¬†even achieve that level of success?_==\n\t\t\t\t- [[Cards/The False Self]]\n\t\t\t\t- [[Cards/Perfectionism]]\n\t\t- https://girlswhothink.wordpress.com/2011/01/18/black-swan-some-thoughts-on-perfection-narcissism-and-the-shadow/\n\t\t\t- As a psychotherapist, my perspective is grounded in psychological theories of attachment and of processes in the unconscious, and ==Nina‚Äôs pursuit of perfection is, in my eyes, deeply connected to her traumatic relationship with her mother and with herself.==\n\t\t\t- Nina‚Äôs very fragile sense of self was apparent to me right from the start of the film. ¬†Portman plays Nina as strangely child-like while at home with her mother, and anxious, eager to acheive, and tightly emotionally constricted in public. ¬†==Nina is a narcissist, a person whose entire sense of self relies on the reflection she receives from others, rather than from her own internal sense of who she is. ¬†Her identity relies on pleasing others by being perfect in the ways that she was taught to define herself==: with her precision of dance technique, her hard work and devotion to dance, her thin body, her sexual purity, her devotion and obedience to her mother, and her maintenance of her role as the ‚Äúsweet girl‚Äù child figure.\n\t\t\t\t- [[Cards/The False Self]] defined by [[Cards/Tangibles]]\n\t\t\t\t- Lack of [[Cards/The True Self]]\n\t\t\t- Narcissism develops when a baby doesn‚Äôt get enough mirroring and attunement from her parent/caregiver. Instead of the parent watching their child to reflect back and validate emotions and facial expressions, the parent looks to the child for a reassuring reflection and attunement, and the child learns that she needs to meet the parent‚Äôs needs instead of vice-versa. ¬†It can create the feeling that love is conditional on the child being a certain way. ¬†Children are biologically programmed to love their parents, and to know that they depend on this love for their own survival. ¬†So the child immediately catches on‚Äì¬†_I exist for my parent. ¬†I am‚Äì I have to be‚Äì what my parent needs me to be_. ¬†A false self that is based entirely on approval, and composed of the qualities demanded (overtly or subtly) by the parent, is what develops. ¬†All other parts of the child are repressed, and a real self is never created. ¬†There is a feeling of being unseen. ¬†The child, and the adult that that child becomes, has no ego‚Ä¶ and therefore all that can develop is an inflated, grandiose self, or a kind of depressed nothingness.\n\t\t\t- Nina certainly has some of that inflated self‚Äì her dogged pursuit of perfection (in her dance, in her prissy attitude, in her eating disorder) shows us that. ¬†And when we see more and more of Nina‚Äôs interactions with her mother, we get an idea of how she may have learned to lean so heavily on this idea of perfection rather than on her own imperfect humanness. We immediately see numerous subtle and not-so-subtle methods that her mother uses to control her‚Äì and we can only conclude that this control has gone on throughout Nina‚Äôs life. ¬†We don‚Äôt have a hard time figuring out that Nina‚Äôs sense of self had to be constructed by her mother‚Äôs expectations, and that Nina probably never had a lot of room to become her own person. To her mother, Nina is not an individual, a person in her own right‚Äì Nina is only an expression or reflection of her mother. (The numerous paintings of Nina in her mother‚Äôs studio give us some indication of the degree to which Nina‚Äôs mother is enmeshed/obsessed with Nina.)\n\t\t\t- Certain human qualities are not acceptable for her to have. ¬†She begins to repress them, to stuff them down into a little box deep inside of her. ¬†Her need to be separate, her desire for recognition that she doesn‚Äôt have to share with her mother, her need to grow, her sexual self, her desire to ever be anything other than perfect‚Ä¶ all of these get stuffed into that box. ¬†Along with those unacceptable qualities and desires also go the feelings that she can‚Äôt express‚Äì like her anger, her hatred of her mother, and her aggression‚Äì and all the fantasies that go along with them. ¬†Imagine all of that stuff together, packed in tightly. ¬†It leaks out a little bit in everyday life, but only unconsciously, in the form of (arguably, socially acceptable) aggression against herself and her body, such as vomiting up meals and dancing past her physical limit.\n\t\t\t- It‚Äôs pretty normal for an artist to try to access or embody different parts of themselves in order to immerse themselves in an artistic process. ¬†But Nina‚Äôs false self is so fragile and so restricted that she can‚Äôt access any different parts without that box full of shadow pieces spilling its guts.\n\t\t\t- She can‚Äôt express any of these feelings directly‚Äì she can‚Äôt discuss them or sublimate them into her dance or even develop a conscious awareness of them. ¬†The hallucinations serve to express her disturbance, and simultaneously they protect her from the trauma of consciously acknowledging it. ¬†But slowly they take her over more and more. ¬†We don‚Äôt know whether Nina really dies at the end of the movie or not, but I can certainly believe that her self-destructiveness would go that far. ¬†There was no more self-control or self-directedness in her anymore‚Ä¶ her mind was taken over by her anxiety and her disturbance, and led forward (to finish the dance) by that still strong desire for perfection, that yearning to be lovable.\n\t\t\t\t- [[Cards/Ressentiment]]\n\t\t\t\t- [[Cards/Desire]] to be loved\n\t\t\t- A person who learns to stifle herself in the pursuit of perfection is a person who has been taught ==‚ÄúI‚Äôm not lovable on my own, as the person I am separate from my accomplishments.‚Äù== ¬†I thought that Black Swan was a beautiful illustration of this idea, played out to its extreme.\n\t\t\t\t- [[Cards/Perfectionism]]\n\t\t\t\t- [[Cards/Tangibles]]\n\t\t\t\t- [[Cards/Self-rejection]]\n- [Shining on the Stage: Narcissism and the Performing Arts](https://sobider.com/?mod=tammetin\u0026makaleadi=\u0026makaleurl=371b840f-c7e5-4898-ac59-7ad258277bb8.pdf\u0026key=40557)\n\t- Performers should distinguish between an ==inner self and a commercial self== in order to eliminate the harmful effects of narcissism and to have a more peaceful and healthy performing life\n\t- Stage performers generally tend to have narcissistic personal traits. The studies showed that narcissistic performers are visionary and inspirational (Campbell, et al, 2011). Many times the society adores, watches, follows and loves them because they are determined and selfassured leaders (Dionne and Davis, 2012: 135-140). Their courage on risk-taking (Brunell and Buelow, 2017: 3-14) is interesting and exciting to watch because normal and standard actions are safe but boring. Thus it can be concluded that the society forces performers to be narcissistic to some extent, since performers should be applauded, liked, admired and gone after. ==If performers do not adore their own selves, nobody does==\n\t- The theory that low narcissistic individuals do not try hard to prove themselves to anybody and do not use self-enhancement opportunities (Wallace and Baumeister, 2002) strengthens the idea that narcissism brings success. It can be concluded that if narcissistic performers face negative feedback, sarcasm or criticism, they can get angry, frustrated and disappointed. Since the reaction was seen as an ego-threat, they can see this as an opportunity to prove their future success and work harder. Moreover, the study of Martinsen points out that narcissists have creative personalities and strong motivation (Martinsen et al, 2019: 166-171). This fact enables narcissistic stage performers to be more successful since stage is a creative working area. The coworkers and the audience of narcissists would be excited, and appreciate creativity and motivation which contribute a lot to the performance.\n\n#### Outline\n###### Draft 1\n1. Let's start with the surface -- my relationship with dance and its effects on me\n\t1. [[Cards/Disordered attachments]]: I have a disordered attachment to dance\n\t2. [[Cards/Pusillanimity]]: This relationship is leading me to live a small life\n\t\t1. Self-love: the warped kind...it's narcissism\n\t\t\t1. Narcissism is a personality trait that exists on a spectrum. It is characterized by high self-involvement and a need for admiration and attention.\n\t\t\t2. I am probably the covert type ^\n\t\t\t\t1. Difficulty taking criticism\n\t\t\t\t2. Feeling and expressing they are not good enough\n\t\t\t\t3. Often pretends to play the victim\n\t\t\t\t4. Shames and blames others for their mistakes\n\t\t\t\t5. Poor self-esteem\n\t\t\t\t6. Insecure and low confidence\n\t\t2. Connect to symptoms:\n\t\t\t1. [[Cards/False Humility]]\n\t\t\t\t1. Blocking me from engaging creatively with the world\n\t\t\t2. [[Cards/Ressentiment]]\n\t\t\t\t1. limiting my ability to see things objectively and engage creatively with others...a cognitive distortion\n2. It's more than dance....it has something to do with who I am\n\t2. [[Cards/Problem versus Mystery]]: I think I'm approaching this the wrong way. \n\t\t1. I'm treating my relationship with dance as a problem to fix, when in reality, it's a mystery that I'll never stop seeking to understand. \n\t\t\t1. At first I thought of it as a decision-making process (e.g. Should I quit or should I stay?) Then I realized that I was asking the wrong questions\n\t\t\t2. If we treat the question ‚ÄúWho am I?‚Äù as a problem, we answer with our tangibles. But if we treat ‚ÄúWho am I?‚Äù as a mystery, we acknowledge that there is more to us than this constructed persona.\n\t\t2. This is more than just a relationship with dance. What I'm really talking about here is my relationship with myself. \n\t\t\t1. Dance is a representation of external validation....success\n\t3. My identity\n\t\t2. [[Cards/Tangibles]]\n\t\t\t1. What I do: I'm a dancer\n\t\t\t2. What I have: teams, accomplishments, etc.\n\t\t\t3. What people say I am: how \"good enough\" I am\n\t\t3. [[Cards/The False Self]]: Bianca the dancer may be part of me, but it is not who I truly am\n\t4. I need to discover who I truly am\n\t\t1. [[Cards/The True Self]]: I need to connect with this\n\t\t2. [[Cards/Brokenness]]: And I can only find this if I get in touch with my trauma. What is the hole dance is filling in my life?\n\t\t\t1. [[Cards/Desire]]: Desires show how we are uniquely broken. \n3. How can I continue dancing without pain? A.K.A. How can I stop tormenting myself?\n\t1. [[Sources/Inner Compass]]: Strategy of Liberation\n\t2. I believe that part of my purpose/vocation (loving others) can be fulfilled by dance\n\t3. Dance is a gift. I value dance, which is why I love performing, teaching and jamming with others\n\n###### Draft 2\n1. My relationship with dance (explained with Black Swan).\n\t1. \n2. My relationship with myself\n\t1. [[Cards/Problem versus Mystery]]: I'm asking the wrong questions\n\t\t1. Transition? Thesis statement?\n3.  Do I choose death or life?\n\t1. Death is despair...represented by Nina's \"suicide\". \n4. Conclusion: shifting from despair to hope?\n\t1. Dance: from accomplishment to gift\n\t2. Talent? is Not a demand from God. It's a present\n\n###### Draft 3\n1. Problem\n\t1. Life Question: Why do I have a toxic relationship with dance?\n\t2. Thesis statement: Because I have a toxic relationship with myself.\n\t\t1. My perfectionism deformed a life-giving gift into a destructive dependency.\n\t\t2. Beneath this extreme desire for control is a broken soul, who believes that love will always be out of reach\n\t3. Like what I shared in my reflection, witnessing and creating art -- especially dance -- makes my life worth living.\n\t\t1. [[Sources/The Flying Spaghetti Monster, Aristotle, and Fernando Amorsolo]]: I believe that human creativity is one of the best ways we can experience God's divine essence. (Just like with Amorsolo and his paintings)\n\t\t2. [[Cards/Gloria dei vivens homo]]: Art makes us come fully alive, and that is the glory of God.\n\t\t3. [[Cards/The First Principle and Foundation]]: Creativity is a gift from God. It helps us know more God easily, and in turn love more readily.\n\t4. [[Cards/Disordered attachments]]:  However, this gift has also become quite the burden to me ([[Cards/Consolation]] and [[Cards/Desolation]]). What used to be just a fulfilling commitment is now also an unhealthy obsession...a \"hook\". It was no longer freeing.\n\t\t1. [[Sources/Suffering - The Call of a Wounded Healer]]: I associated dance with  physical/emotional suffering (e.g. anxiety, burnout, restlessness). These symptoms showed me that I wasn't living in alignment with myself.\n\t\t\t1. [[Cards/Problem versus Mystery]]: At first, I was treating this question/relationship like a problem that could be fixed (e.g. quitting a group/hobby).\n\t\t\t2. But immediately trying to fix/cure the problem is the wrong approach. I would be ignoring my pain, instead of trying to understand it. \n\t\t\t3. The best approach is to listen to the pain. Like what Jung said, this could serve as an opportunity/invitation to learn more about myself. I needed to dig deeper, to get involved in this mystery. \n\t\t2. [[Cards/Perfectionism]]: Dance became an attachment when I started approaching it as a pursuit for perfection.\n\t\t\t1. [[Cards/Tangibles]]: I was pursuing an ideal self/avatar:\n\t\t\t\t1. Role: Dancer \n\t\t\t\t2. Reputation: Great at dance (verified by others)\n\t\t\t\t3. Riches: Team memberships, awards, etc. (material verification)\n\t\t\t2. [[Sources/Everything Happens for a Reason - and Other Lies I Have Loved]]: I believed in a prosperity gospel/meritocracy; if I work hard, I should be able to achieve my goals! \n\t\t\t3. ^ This is an example of absolute certitude ([[Cards/Absolute Certainty versus Wonder]]). [[Cards/We operate our everyday lives on unfounded certitudes]]\n\t\t\t4. Rejection fatigue: But I failed. Again and again and again. Which of course, left me distraught.\n\t\t\t5. [[Cards/Discernment]]: As a result, my life became like a wheel of fortune, for my happiness was dependent on my standards of success (dictated by [[Cards/Tangibles]]). It was a life of mere survival.\n\t\t3. [[Sources/Inner Compass]]: My attachment wasn't really dance; it was the idea of perfection. I was no longer free, for my whole live revolved around pursuing this.\n\t\t\t1. Symptoms of being hooked:\n\t\t\t\t1. It takes up all my energy and attention.\n\t\t\t\t2. It's exhausting -- not just physically, but also emotionally.\n\t\t\t\t3. It distorts me, making me inflexible and unbalanced.\n\t\t\t2. Rule of thumb: It's a disordered attachment if it causes you and others harm.\n\t\t\t\t1. [[Perfectionism disables us from seeing life as it truly is]]: I would always succumb to cognitive distortions. (e.g. polarized thinking, overgeneralization, blaming)\n\t\t\t\t2. [[Perfectionism makes us harm ourselves and others more]]: I was always focused on my faults...and I secretly resented others for lacking these\n\t\t\t\t\t1. [[Cards/False Humility]] \u0026 [[Cards/Ressentiment]]\n2. Expound (what is it rooted in?)\n\t1. My attachment was leading me to live a small life, revealing my selfish nature.\n\t\t1. [[Cards/Pusillanimity]]: My world was small, for it revolved around dance. \n\t\t\t1. And since dance was my way of pursuing an ideal self, this world really revolved around me. This is self-love, a.k.a. [[Narcissism]]. \n\t\t\t2. At first, I thought this couldn't apply to me, given my low self-esteem. But narcissism exists on a spectrum, always involving high self-involvement and a need for admiration and attention. It just so happens that mine is on the covert/vulnerable end of the spectrum:\n\t\t\t\t1. Difficulty taking criticism\n\t\t\t\t2. Feeling and expressing they are not good enough\n\t\t\t\t3. Often pretends to play the victim\n\t\t\t\t4. Shames and blames others for their mistakes\n\t\t\t\t5. Poor self-esteem\n\t\t\t\t6. Insecure and low confidence\n\t\t\t3. [[Sources/Expanding the Shrunken Soul]]\n\t\t\t\t1. [[Cards/False Humility]]: preoccupation with my limitations, denying my own worth. This blocks me from creatively engaging with the world...instead of sharing my talents, I bury them\n\t\t\t\t2. [[Cards/Ressentiment]]: my hatred for more talented people\n\t\t\t\t\t1. reassignment of the pain that accompanies a sense of one's own inferiority/failure on to an external scapegoat.\n\t2. How did I end up this way? I am selfish not because I love myself -- quite the opposite. I think I will be forever unlovable. \n\t\t1. [[Cards/Desire]] \u0026 [[Cards/Brokenness]]: my desire for love reveals how I'm uniquely broken. My life has led me to believe that love is conditional\n\t\t2. [[Cards/The True Self]] and [[Cards/The False Self]]: Important people in my life (e.g. my mother, my past dance teachers) attacked the home-grown sense of self I had, demanding that their standards be achieved. (Narcissistic injury) So I developed a self based on this approval.\n\t\t\t1. [[The Challenge to Love]]: These people operated in terms of power, motivated by fear. Their love for me was how they took me, and exercised their power over me. They treated me as an extension of themselves.\n\t\t\t2. They were narcisissts\n\t\t\t3. They didn't really love me as the other\n\t\t\t4. Perhaps that's why learning I have narcisstic tendencies hit hard...repeating the cycle of pain\n\t\t\t5. They showed me that I could never be safe, for my weaknesses could always be held against me.\n\t\t\t6. [[Sources/Images of Integrity - Across the Great Divide]]: Thus, it was undeniable that I would create a masked and armored self.\n\t\t\t\t1. [[Narcissism]] as a maladaptive method for self-regulation. \n\t\t3. [[content/Permanent Notes/The Divided Life]]: This duality of the True Self and False Self, this fragmented psyche, is what characterizes my narcissism. I may play my role/mask well, but it doesn't satisfy my soul, my inner child.\n\t\t\t1. Black swan v.s. white swan\n\t\t4. [[Cards/Self-rejection]]: Beneath my armor is a narcissistic scar. The shame of my trauma is so significant to the point that I never feel truly good about who I am. This feeling remains, no matter how much I accomplish in life.\n\t\t\t1. I don't believe that I have a True Self. I always feel like I'm performing. I don't know who I really am.\n\t\t5. [[Cards/Perfectionism]]: l am unable to appreciate myself (and others who love) because of my constant pursuit of perfection. I crave external validation (e.g. audience adoration) instead of internal validation (e.g. joy in dance)\n\t3. And I could not imagine living life any other way. Perhaps...I am forever doomed to suffer.\n\t\t1. My life dominated by this need for control, reeks of despair.\n\t\t\t1. [[Sources/Finding Hope When Life Doesn't Go As Planned]]: Holding on to perfection/God's divinity. I believe that if I'm not everything, I'm nothing.If I'm not God, I don't deserve to exist.\n\t\t\t2. My inability to choose between mediocrity v.s. death (exemplified by Nina's \"suicide\" in pursuit of artistic perfection)\n3. So how can I move on...how can I begin to heal? (Love and hope)\n\t1. [[Sources/Inner Compass]]: I can deattach from perfectionism through the way of the deepest desire/Strategy of Liberation. I need to remember how the process of dance gives me joy -- an abiding sense of peace that my life is meaningful.\n\t\t1. What is the music in my heart that leads me into the dance...and overrides the fear that keps me clinging to the rails?\n\t\t\t1. [[Sources/Everything Happens for a Reason - and Other Lies I Have Loved]]: Beauty and love. These will always exist, even in the darkness. I know that I am capable of finding it.\n\t\t2. My holy mountain: living with God? embodying him? [[Cards/The First Principle and Foundation]]; \n\t2. [[Sources/Suffering - The Call of a Wounded Healer]]: This journey will be long and hard. But I endure, because I believe that these growing pains are necessary. For it is in suffering where callings emerge. \n\t\t1. A process of deattachment? Going from false self to true self\n\t\t2. Particularly the call to authentic personhood, which involves \"...a commitment to continual growth and change, which requires to undergoing pain and discomfort...[a]  necessary and inevitable part of the process...\"\n\t\t3. We can only get in touch with [[Cards/The True Self]] through pain \n\t3. [[Sources/The Need for Certainty]]: In the process of self-discovery, we seek certainty. Two questions on our calling?\n\t\t1. Who am I (stripped of all my influences)? \n\t\t\t1. I am human.\n\t\t\t\t1. [[Sources/Suffering - The Call of a Wounded Healer]]: Symptoms teach humility. I am vulnerable and weak. I am reminded that I am not God. I need help. I can't do it all alone.\n\t\t\t\t2. [[Sources/Expanding the Shrunken Soul]]: Being humbled is also being reminded of the good God has placed and achieved in me. I am guided towards [[Cards/Maganimity]]: a sense of inner fullness and appreciation of our own dignity (and how God can work through us)\n\t\t\t2. Thus, I am capable of love, contrary to what I inherently believe\n\t\t\t\t1. For attachment is an indicator of care. \n\t\t\t\t\t1. The Little Prince: \"It's the time you've wasted on your rose that makes your rose so important\"\n\t\t\t\t2. C.S. Lewis: Love that makes us vulnerable. \n\t\t\t\t3. But it also makes us truly human and alive. (Homo amans)\n\t\t\t3. Dance allows me to be my true self....to experience wholeness\n\t\t3. Where do I fit into all of this (a.k.a. my value and mission)?\n\t\t\t1. And in turn, I believe being creative...is my unique way of loving. \n\t\t\t2. [[Sources/Suffering - The Call of a Wounded Healer]]: Artists can be wounded healers too. They find meaning in their suffering because it allows them to connect with others who are also in pain. By healing others, they heal themselves as well. Perhaps I can do the same. \n\t\t\t\t1. A form of antifragility\n\t\t\t3. [[Ministry to a Hopeless Man]]: Love not only lasts forever, it needs only a second to come about.\n\t\t\t\t1. Examples: cyphers, classes, inspiring choreos.... examples of beauty\n\t\t\t\t2. The power of dance, as an ethereal art\n\t4. Takeaway: I need to give up my ambitions, my goals. But I am afraid of letting go of my hook, my golden calf -- control. I am afraid of journeying into the unknown. \n\t\t1. This journey is a mystery...but I'll commit to it with wonder, and see what it has in store for me.

He lives day-to-day, doing the tasks which he feels are expected of him but does not seem to feel any true emotion. He is not sure why he does what he does and does not realize his actions can have destructive consequences.\n- **Trigger warning**: This novel has violence and destruction of others and self. Unlike¬†_Brave New World,_¬†which is set in a world very different from our own, Meursault's world is highly relatable. Its systems are literally our systems and the lives of the characters are very similar to our lives. Because of this, Meursault may feel eerily like us. But his choices should not be our choices. As you read, bear in mind that¬†**the destruction of others and the self is NOT an option**.\n- Here are some questions to help anchor your reading:\n\t- Why does Meursault live the way he does? How would you describe his \"style\" of living?\n\t- Is he making choices or are circumstances acting upon him?\n\t- Is he a nice person? Why is he likeable enough?\n\t- When he commits his act of violence, is it out of a personal choice? Or was he being acted upon by circumstances?\n\t- Is he conscious of making choices and decisions?\n\t- Are you sympathetic?\n- Before you proceed, watch [this short video on Camus's philosophy of the absurd.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPtzpjC7TF4)\n\t- \"If the world were clear, art would not exist.\" - [[Albert Camus]], \"The Myth of Sisyphus: Absurd Creation\" [[Art would not exist in a clear world]]\n\t- Coming from a background of violence, Camus pondered: \"If the world was meaningless, could our individual lives still hold value?\"\n\t- [[Existentialism]]\n\t\t- Existentialists believed people were born as blank slates, each responsible for creating their life's meaning amidst a chaotic world\n\t\t- All people were born with a shared human nature that bonded them towards common goals\n\t\t- One such meaning was to seek out meaning despite the world's arbitrary cruelty\n\t\t- Camus viewed **humanity's desire for meaning** and **the universe's silent indifference** as two incompatible puzzle pieces, and considered trying to fit them together to be fundamentally absurd. This tension became the heart of Camus' Philosophy of the Absurd ([[Cards/Absurdity]]), which argued that life is inherently futile.\n\t\t- Exploring how to live life without meaning became the guiding question behind Camus' early work, which he called the **\"cycle of the absurd\"**\n\t\t- If life is truly meaningless, is committing suicide the only rational response? Camus' answer was an emphatic no. There may not be any explanation for our unjust world, but ==choosing to live regardless is the deepest expression of our genuine freedom.== [[Choosing to live is an expression of freedom]]\n\t\t- All of humanity is in the same position as Sisyphus. ==Only when we accept the meaninglessness of our lives can we face the absurd with our heads held high.== As camus says, when the king chooses to begin his relentless task once more, [[One must imagine Sisyphus happy]].\n\t\t- Camus' contemporaries weren't so accepting of futility. Many Existentialists advocated for violent revolution to upend systems they believed were depriving people of agency and purpose. Camus responded with his second set of work: \"the cycle of revolt\"\n\t\t\t- In The Rebel, he explored rebellion as a creative act rather than a destructive one [[Rebellion is a creative act]]\n\t\t- Camus believed that inverting power dynamics only ledto an endless cycle of violence. Instead the way to avoid needless bloodshed is to ==establish a public understanding of our shared human nature==\n\t\t\t- \"The cycle of love\"\n- The video explains to us that to Camus, life is essentially meaningless. Hence, it's absurd. But, the destruction of self is not an option. ==As life is meaningless, then even more so, we exercise our freedom to actually FIND meaning or CHOOSE to live a life of meaning.==\n- Question: Given Camus's philosophy of finding meaning in absurdity, did Meursault die happy? Why or why not?\n#### How to live in the face of absurdity?\n- [7 Life Lessons from Albert Camus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Idhb8OVDCM)\n\t- Introduction\n\t\t- Absurdism: Human beings exist in a purposeless, chaotic universe\n\t\t- Camus wanted to distance himself from [[Existentialism]]\n\t\t- Camus believed that absolute freedom must be balanced with absolute justice\n\t\t\t- Too much freedom: the strong suppresses the weak\n\t\t\t- Too much justice: kills freedom\n\t\t\t- Freedom as a constant given; humans are condemned to be free\n\t\t\t- It's possible to achieve freedom and justice at the same time without compromise\n\t\t- Life has no meaning; the universe simply exists and is indifferent to people's lives\n\t- **Create your own meaning for life**\n\t\t- \"You will never live if you are looking for the meaning of life\"\n\t\t- Man's existence is absurd as there is no justification for it\n\t\t- Human values do not have a solid external component\n\t\t- Everything is man-made\n\t\t- 3 ways to deal with the absurdity of life: suicide, faith, acceptance\n\t\t\t- Suicide and faith are irrational escapes from addressing the contradiction between the human desire for meaning and the indifference of the universe\n\t\t\t\t- Suicide: person removes physical form that was on charge of finding life's meaning. Without the human mind, the absurd cannot exist\n\t\t\t\t- Faith: the human being embraces irrationality and arrives at a certain concept regarding life's meaning, which defies rationality. Camus also considered faith a philosophical suicide, because faith defies rationality, irrationality being the opposite of a philosophical argument.\n\t\t\t- What remains is acceptance. Acceptance leads to individual freedom, you can create new meanings and you can even create yourself.\n\t\t\t\t- Acceptance is in essence Camus' core belief in how someone should live their life. The sooner you accept meaninglessness, the sooner you can become free\n\t\t- There is no absolute meaning of life; the meaning of your life is different to the meaning of someone else's.\n\t\t- How to apply: stop thinking that your life must be a certain way. Live like no one is watching you; you are absolutely free to choose how your life will be.\n\t\t\t- Meaning acquired from life circumstances -\u003e meaning chosen on your own\n\t- **Don't make happiness a distant goal**\n\t\t- \"The struggle itself towards the height is enough to fill a man's heart. [[One must imagine Sisyphus happy]].\"\n\t\t- Most of us crave \"security\", the feeling of being safe. And we pin our hopes on security on shifting variety of goals (a.k.a. [[Cards/Tangibles]]). We think we'll be able to achieve peace once we acquire these\n\t\t- The more we chase for the things we believe we want, often the more unhappy we become.The secret is to learn to enjoy the process and to not mind so much about the goals. The more we can enjoy the process of achieving our goals, the happier we become and the finalgoals can even start becoming irrelevant.\n\t\t- Instead of seeking happiness in the goal, find joy in the process ( See Happiness v.s. Joy in [[Cards/Discernment]])\n\t- **Don't be ignorant**\n\t\t- \"The evil that is in the world almost always comes from ignorance and good intentions may do as much harm as malevolence if they lack understanding.\"\n\t\t- The world is in need of a new and simpler morality,  based on fairness and team spirit\n\t\t- The man with the right information and knowledge would always choose to do noharm to others.We live in an interconnected world and we are social beings, therefore no man with enoughintelligence would choose to harm others, as the harm would come back to him eventually.The morality of absurdism is very much rooted in empathy and the practical aspects of life,having a lot to do with fraternity between people and the application of fairness principles.\n\t\t- How to act: be informed; don't take things personally\n\t\t- The only way we can break the vicious cycle of hate is refusing to continue to hate.\n\t- **Be a rebel**\n\t\t- \"I rebel, therefore I exist.\"\n\t\t- A rebel is someone who learns to say no.\n\t\t- We need to get rid of the desire to please others, because we would waste our life otherwise. We have only one life to live and we need to live it more authentically.\n\t\t- Your freedom to be who you are and express yourself is too precious to be traded formoney or for a higher status in society. It would make you feel unhappy and would add stress to your life, affecting you mentallyand even physically.\n\t\t- [[To be alive is to rebel]]\n\t- **Spend time with yourself**\n\t\t- \"Solitude, a luxury of the rich\"\n\t\t- The surest way to live in solitude is to have enough money to afford to livealone, to travel alone, to work alone, and to spend your holidays on private beachesinstead of crowded shores. Money can buy you solitude, although it doesn‚Äôt buy you an absurd life.However, solitude makes it possible for you to have enough time with yourself to meditate on the absurdity of life, to find out that life has no meaning but the one you give it.\n\t\t- How to take action: find a window of time where you can be by yourself\n\t- **Be flexible**\n\t\t- ‚ÄúBlessed are thehearts that can bend; they shall never be broken.\n\t\t- The one who can survive in extreme situations is the one who can adapt the best, accordingto the theory of evolution itself.\n\t\t- Also, some scientists even consider that flexibility is at the heart of human intelligence.\n\t\t- Aron Barbey, Professor of Psychology at The University of Illinois proposed that the brain‚Äôs dynamic properties drive human intelligence. Making smart decisions, adapted to the circumstances, can prevent our heart from being totally brokenand, in time, we can heal.\n\t\t- What's good for one situation may not be for another. The world is always changing, and we need to adapt to new circumstances\n\t- **Choose Love**\n\t\t- \"Nothing in life is worth turning your back on, if you love it.\"\n\t\t- Love is an act of rebellion and it is the force of life, giving us a shield of protection against being broken by the absurd.\n\t\t- To apply this lesson in our life, we need to live more in the present, to learn to express our love for other people more often, without pondering too much about what the future will bring to those relationships.\n### Module 4: The modern condition\n#### Revisiting\n- So far, in this course, we have explored the modernist concepts of¬†_alienation, fragmentation, absurdity_, as well as issues of¬†_finding the self_¬†and¬†_finding meaning._¬†We have also explored how our economic and political systems have had very challenging effects on the individual and our sense of ourselves. In our novel for module 4, which is the very suspenseful yet very moving¬†_Patron saints of nothing_¬†by Filipino-American Randy Ribay, we get to explore these same concepts as they are expressed in contemporary times.\n- Before we begin, though, it is important to make a distinction between what \"modern\" means and what \"contemporary\" means.¬†\n\t- _Modern_, as I've defined in this class, is more ==a way of seeing or a way of perceiving, just as it is a way of be-ing.== In which case, \"modern\" is not attached to any real time frame (although the sensibility has been more marked after the industrial revolution). \n\t- \"Contemporary\", though, means \"this same time\". In other words, \"contemporary\" is not a sensibility or way of perceiving or being. Rather, it refers to ==a specific time, analogous to our lives today.==¬†_Patron saints of nothing_, then, is a contemporary novel as it was published in 2019, pretty much during this time, this generation, that we are in.\n- As we read and discuss this novel, pay close attention to how the modern concepts we have discussed play out in the lives of the characters of the novel.\n#### Hyphens\n- The novel begins with the dedication, \"for the hyphenated\". It's an interesting audience to dedicate a book too as what is a¬†_hyphenated_¬†person anyway? Let's explore this a bit.\n- When we hyphenate a word, we connect two words to make them one. Or, we connect two concepts to make them one. But, when a hyphenated word is written down, we see the two distinct words and the hyphen that somehow connected them. The connection is necessary because there may not be a word for the concept that is expressed by two words hyphenated together. So, a hyphenated concept would be one that is composed of two distinct concepts, made into one, but the two concepts do not blur into the other. Rather, ==they remain distinct but unified. Or unified in their distinct-ness.==\n- Considering this brief analysis of what a \"hyphenated\" concept could be, who do you think the book,¬†_Patron saints of nothing_, is dedicated to? What could be an¬†_hyphenated_¬†person? Feel free to also explore other ideas on what 'hyphenated' means!\n\n##### Answer\nIn my eyes, I believe that Filipino culture is inherently hypenated. Due to our centuries-long history with colonization (e.g. Spanish, Japanese, Americans), our culture is a mixing pot of international influences, and it's impossible to imagine Filipino culture without them. And this struggle with being hypenated is expressed most in our colonial mentality: the internalized belief that we are inferior to our colonizers.\n\nI've experienced this in how I learned languages. Growing up, I was taught English first instead of Filipino. While this allowed me to speak English with complete mastery, my Filipino suffered. It doesn't help that I went to a high school that mainly taught in English, and that English is considered a native language in the Philippines. Because of this, I always felt insecure about my identity; how can I claim I'm Filipino when I'm not good at speaking the language?\n\n#### [[Fragmentation]]\n- The related concepts of¬†_fragmentation_¬†and¬†_alienation_¬†are visible in the novel. Between the two,¬†*fragmentation* is more clearly connected with the idea of a¬†hyphenated person as ==this kind of identity would have different, distinct fragments, that make the whole.== So, some questions to think about:\n\t- How are the characters in the novel made up of distinct parts that may 'battle' with each other? And how are these parts, no matter how distinct or in conflict, making up a whole?¬†\n\t-   What are the causes for fragmentation that you see with the characters? There may be different causes for each one.¬†\n\t-   Would you say that fragmentation is an essential element of who each character is?\n- But when we think of fragmentation, we also need to consider that ==societies can be fragmented as well.== We can ask similar questions about societies/cultures:\n\t- How are the societies/cultures of the novel composed of fragments? What seems to be 'wholes' of these societies/cultures? And what are the fragments? What causes the fragments?\n\t-  How are these fragments an important characteristic of these societies/cultures?\n- And then, we can also think of fragmentation as ==visible in our lives== today:\n\t- How are you fragmented? How do these fragments seem to struggle against each other? What enabled these fragments? How is your own identity the total of 'warring' parts?\n\t-   How are our lives and societies fragmented today?\n\t-   How do fragments shine through?\n\n##### Answer\nFragmentation is also expressed in my identity as a polymath. I have multiple passions -- design, dance, education -- and I want to pursue them all! These fragments shine by making me more unique; in an increasingly competitive world, being a T-shaped person (someone who has one speciality, but also has a range of related skills) will get you far in life. Unfortunately, having multiple interests as a polymath can also be a struggle, because there is only so much you can do with your limited time and energy. I often burn myself out because I always want to do everything; learning how to discern and focus was a hard but necessary skill for me.\n\n#### [[Alienation]]\n- Aside from fragmentation, the characters of the novel experience various expressions of¬†_alienation._¬†We can start examining alienation through our main character whose diasporic (Philippine-American) heritage makes him both fragmented and alienated. But apart from his heritage, there are other forms of alienation that he experiences, which involve his family, friends, the society he lives in. So some questions to as:\n\t- how is Jake both fragmented and alienated?\n\t-  how do the conditions of fragmentation and alienation contribute to his overall personhood?\n\t-  what factors lead to the alienation he experiences?\n- But aside from Jake, we get the sense that other characters are alienated too! How do other characters experience alienation? Are they alienated from themselves and others? From family? What factors lead to the alienation?\n\n##### Answer\nI definitely believe that Tito Maning experiences alienation. He is strongly commited to his beliefs; he is not only loud and imposing when it comes to these beliefs, but he also looks down on others who don't align with him. Thus, he ended up becoming alienated from the rest of his family. He is estranged/distant from his siblings because of their \"wrong\" lifestyle choices (e.g. same-sex marriage, migrating abroad); meanwhile, even if his daughters remain physically close to him, he is alienated from them as well because they are harboring secrets from him (e.g. owning technology, having relationships).\n\n#### Absurdity and meaning\n- Are there any indications in the novel on the meaninglessness of life? Any incidents that seem so absurd to you?\n- But, at the same time, does the novel have anything to say about how meaning and happiness can be found?\n- Let's talk about Jake. How does he seem to be carving a sense of meaning for himself? How does a longing for meaning shape the decisions he makes? What about the other characters? Are they finding meaning? How? Or are they just coasting along?¬†\n- What factors make it difficult for all the characters to find meaning?\n- What makes it difficult for YOU to find meaning?\n\n##### Answer\nIn Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, self-actualization is at the top. One cannot attend to this need without first fulfilling lower needs, such as esteem, love and belonging, safety, and physiology. Therefore, it is nearly impossible to find meaning when you are in survival mode, a.k.a. living day by day just focused on getting by. Unfortunately, this applies to majority of Filipinos. Most of their time and effort has to be spent on addressing their lower needs -- especially nowadays, costs for goods are mostly higher while acquiring jobs is getting harder\n\n\n#### Self-knowledge\n- Jung reminds us about how hard it is to look deep inside ourselves to find ourselves. How is the journey toward self-knowledge critical in the conflicts that you see in the novel, particularly those that have to do with Jun and Jake? From these two characters, what do we understand about the terrifying but wonderful journey toward self-knowledge?\n- What factors also get in the way of self-knowledge?\n- What about the other characters? Have they found themselves?\n- What about you? How is your journey to self-knowledge?\n\n##### Answer\nIt's one thing to acquire self-knowledge, but it's another to actually act on it. Being self-aware is only helpful when it can lead to personal development. But in a world of lengthy personality tests, informative Instagram carousels, and too real Tiktoks,  one temptation people often fall to (myself included) is acquiring tons of self-knowledge, but not doing anything about it. For instance, I am very aware of how I use work as a coping mechanism for dealing with deeper problems. Unfortunately, I often tend to be a workaholic and burn myself out, even though I know that it's a harmful inclination for me.\n\n#### Saints of nothing\nWhy is the concept of the Patron Saint of Nothing, which Jay wrestles with at the end of the novel, so¬†_modernist_¬†in itself? Just a thought to play with!\n\n##### Answer\nGiven that they are always assigned to certain people/places/things, patron saints represent specialization. I believe \"patron saint of nothing\" is a fit term to describe both Jay and Jun because of their identities as hypenated people. They struggled with fragmentation, as seen in Jay with his Filipino-American identity and Jun with his values and addiction; they also had to deal with alienation, as seen in both boys' alienation from their families. Overall, we can see in the novel how both of them were struggling against external and internal forces, which is characteristic of modernism. I believe that unlike the saints, patron saints of nothing do not know how to fully define themselves, amidst all these forces -- and perhaps may even refuse too. Jun and Jay have definitely exemplified this concept.\n\n### Module 5: Responsibility\nIn this module, we briefly examine what it means to be a responsible individual, in an age where self-knowledge is very important. How do we become responsible while living in conditions of fragmentation, alienation, absurdity, and all other factors that wreak havoc on who we are?\n\n#### Returning to Camus\n[Here is a video of a lecture written by Albert Camus.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvWJX3JW75s) Camus himself read it when he won the Nobel Prize for Literature in the 40s. In this version, the actor, Viggo Mortensen, reads it. It's called \"The Crisis of Man\". I know the title is inappropriately gendered but let's give it to Camus who was writing from a different time. But, do pay attention to how Camus's ideas still remain important today. Personally, I think they're more important today!\n\n#### To think about\nIs the crisis that Camus wrote about in the 40s still visible today? How is that crisis manifested?\n\n##### Answer\nI definitely believe that this human crisis is visible today -- an elevated indifference to great human suffering. It's the reason why people believe history always repeats itself. Whenever we overcome evil, it seeps back into our lives when we forget about it, and in turn become desensitized to it. The most relevant example of this to me is the revival of the Marcos legacy. Despite all the human rights violations that occurred his time, the atrocities of Marcos Sr.'s regime were glossed over by his surface achievements (e.g. infrastructure development, raised economy). And majority of the Filipino population (31 million voters to be exact)  allowed this happen because of their indifference to past suffering.\n\n#### Reconcilation\nModernism tends to be quite inward-looking. Would that be selfish, do you think? How is the idea of responsibility for others reconciled with an inward-looking perspective? Or there is no conflict between responsibility for self-knowledge and responsibility for others?\n\n##### Answer\nDuring one of his lectures, my DLQ prof was talking about the circular nature of love; self-love is fulfilled by loving others, and in turn, loving others is fulfilled by self-love. Thus, in a society that leans towards workaholism, he said that choosing to rest is a form of service; this is because it sustains the quality of your work for others. After all, can you really serve well if you haven't even taken care of yourself? Thus, despite how contradictory it sounds, I believe that responsibility for others can be united with a modernist perspective.\n\n#### Synthesizing the course\nAnd now we come to the end! I hope you enjoyed the course as much as I enjoyed teaching it. What I would like you to remember as we end this course is all this fragmentation, alienation, absurdity, the pain of the journey to self are inevitable. They are part of living in this mortal coil of ours. But, even as much as all these are an inevitable part of truly finding ourselves, there is a part of them that arises from the unjust material conditions we find ourselves with. So, as you face the rest of your lives, consider how you can help everyone on their journeys to self and how you can make conditions less harsh and more enabling.\n\n\n## Historical and Philosophical Foundations of Education\n#EDUC101i #education #history #philosophy \n### Reflection\n#### Questions\n1.

My philosophy is Existentialism: critical theory\n\t2. My school's philosophy is Pragmatism: progressivism; reconstructionism\n\t3. Similarities\n\t\t1. Both tackle societal systems?\n\t\t2. Both aim for students' growth\n\t4. Differences\n\t\t1. Individual experience v.s. external reality\n\t\t\t1. Existentialism focuses on individual experiences (students‚Äô own experiences, history, identities and struggles)\n\t\t\t2. Pragmatism takes a societal approach, always considering the external world\n\t\t2. Critical v.s. conformist\n\t\t\t1. They are also skeptical of the hidden curriculum which refers to the values, behaviour and attitudes conveyed to and imposed on students through the milieu and practices of the school in a capitalist consumer-oriented society.\n4. Value\n\t1. One's philosophy affects how they design learning experiences\n\t\t1. One good exercise for the educator is to reflect on and write down his or her educational philosophy based on one or a combination of educational philosophies presented in this chapter. This will help clarify the educator‚Äôs conviction, values and direction in the teaching profession, thereby sustaining his or her passion to teach and lead.\n\t2. Knowledge of the various educational philosophies and theories can also help educators analyse and solve current educational issues, challenges and problems\n\n##### Writing\nThinking of my own philosophy, I identify the most with critical pedagogy: \"a philosophy of education that encourages the students to be critical towards their reality ‚Äì its power structures, contradictions and flaws\" (The Necessary Teacher Training College, 2022). Teachers seek to awaken their learners by posing problems, creating spaces for growing critical consciousness, creating plans for collective action, and developing a sense of agency (Constanza-Chock, 2020). This philosophy aligns the most with Existentialism, which believes in the following: (1) reality is constructed by the individual, since it's inherently meaningless;  (2) since our perspectives are subjective, what needs to be known is the human condition and one's personal choices; (3) what is valued is freedom, responsibility, and authenticity, since values are found within people. In line with all of this, Existentialists education aims to awaken awareness in the learner by cultivating individual growth and decision making.  Instead of dehumanizing learners by treating them like objects (which is what most schools do with mass education), schools must treat them like the subjects they are, and allow them to explore, reflect on, and articulate their convictions ‚Äî which is exactly what critical pedagogy strives to do.\n\nI believe that the experiences of the minority have played a big part in shaping philosophical perspective. Only those who struggled to thrive in school, and in turn society, would've thoguht of the unforgiving nature of these spaces. As a neurodivergent woman of color, I can definitely relate to this. In a world where everything seems to be designed, I often feel like I can't find a place for myself. Getting exposed to critical theory was life-changing for me; after growing up thinking I was the problem, I realized that the systems we're all embedded in are broken. Thus, I believe that education should be working to disrupt the status quo, instead of simply maintaining it. \n\nWhile my own philosophy of education is based on Existentialism, my proposed school's philosophy is based on Pragmatism, which believes in the following: a dynamic universe, thought done for action, and the relativity of truth. Both of these philosophies focus on the individual experience. Rejecting the universal and absolute ideas upheld by formal schooling, they believed that taught knowledge must be relevant and personal to the learner. They also share the same aim for education ‚Äî growth. However, they varied differently in terms of approach. Pragmatists saw education as preparation for a changing world, so learning was treated as a sensory experience, wherein learners explored the world around them.  Meanwhile, given that they saw education as an instrument of awakening, the Existentialists' treated learning as an intuitive experience, wherein learners went deeply inside themselves. Because of this, the rebellious Existentialists would see the Pragmatists as conformists, who see the practical as what is good for society. Lieberman (1985) summarizes this conflict well: \"The crisis of...education is one of finding ways in which the demands of social conformity may be reconciled with the intrinsic natural diversity in human beings\".\n\nIn my eyes, a Philosophy of Education is like a compass; by spotlighting your North Star, it guides you on your teaching journey. As an aspiring designer, technologist, and educator, my own North Star is convivality: \"individual freedom realized in personal interdependence\" (Illich, 1973). Illich believed that advancement in production not only disabled people from freely using their natural abilities, but also prevented them from connecting with themselves and others. I believe this still applies to the Philippines; as a top destination for outsourcing labor and a testing grounds for social media platforms, exploitation is a fate destined for many here.","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.735605378Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2023-05-02":{"title":"2023-05-02","content":"## Majestic\n- there is owner of boat, sila yung may-ari, bpero there are times when the operators are differnts\n- you are selling the service, not the boat\n- a ship is basically a service, the tool is the boat\n- when u are building a house, the general contractor handles everything\n- shipping = group of different people in discipliens who simplify the logistics process\n- Majestic Shipping is just the OWNER\n- main job: transport cargo from one port to another port\n- OUT OF SCOPE: the process of loading, unloading, tracking\n- Freight forwarding = facilitates the process of tracking, documentation, everything that is needed for loading cargo\n- customs brokerage = facilitates government admin/clerical work\n- non-vessel operating carrier: do not own the boats, just get space in the boat, they handle putting the cargo there\n- majestic: owns vessel, carries cargo (physical labor, kami yung laborer)\n- you need different types of boat to carry different types of cargo, and for different types of jobs as well\n- our ships are like trucks (we just own the driver and the motorcycle)\n- Identity: Owner-Operator\n- Services: Marine Cargo Transport \u0026 Ship Chartering\n- we don't engage with manning\n- direct, simple, just us\n- careful with those who are directly contacting us\n- di na kailangan ng contact form\n- not for promoting; just for informing\n- not for consumer market, more institutional\n- materials are not industries\n- cheap cargo\n- we don't operate/lease a port\n- not secretive...more COMPARTMENTALIZED\n- delete list of fleet....just put range/capacity of boats (500 tons)...just put pictures\n- Towing Tugboat\n- description for ships: cargo carried + industry/service\n- transfer quality statement to about page (after mission-vision) + add values/thrust checklsit\n- contact page like yellow pages: just put email address, contact number\n- call-to-action: address, telephone, email \"For Inquiries: Contact Us\"\n- walang team section\n\n## Psych Consultation\n- https://www.additudemag.com/get-to-sleep-adhd-brain/?src=embed_link\n- https://www.additudemag.com/symptoms-of-insomnia/?src=embed_link\n- https://www.verywellmind.com/tips-for-better-sleep-with-add-20704\n- https://drjohnday.com/10-ways-to-boost-brain-function-with-bdnf/\n- Lack of serotonin","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.735605378Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2023-05-03":{"title":"2023-05-03","content":"## Great Books \n### Assignment 3: Don't Hug Me I'm Scared\n#### Idea Dump\n- Creativity can be be seen as humanity's way of finding meaning in a meaningless world\n- The Myth of Sisyphus and absurd creation: [[Art would not exist in a clear world]]\n- [Absurdist \u0026 Surrealist Literature](https://www.brilliant-books.net/absurdist-surrealist-literature)\n\t- Absurdist writing focuses on the inherent purpose of life being elusive or questioned, can use dark humor to comment on the human condition, and explores themes of existentialism and purposelessness.\n\t- Surrealism is marked by disjointed and occasionally fantastic imagery, irrational juxtaposition, and can be dreamlike.\n\t- While absurdism is a philosophy, surrealism is more of a creative tool. Surrealism is often used to assist the absurdist objective by emphasizing the incomprehensible, confusing, and irrationality nature of life, but can be used outside of absurdism as well.\n- [Surrealist art and the resolution of absurd](https://hekint.org/2018/03/07/surrealist-art-resolution-absurd/)\n\t- [[Cards/Absurdity]]\n\t\t- Surrealist art depicts an absurd world in an extraordinary way: our lives are cornered by incomprehension; confused by an existence without obvious meaning; and death stalks our every step.\n\t\t- Camus states that humans question the world around us, but the world does not respond with clear, irrefutable evidence. ==The absurd experience is the disconnection we sense between our need for a place in the universe and our inability to find it.== Clinically this confrontation presents as existential angst, neurosis, or simple incomprehension.\n\t\t- The sense of absurdity is an uncomfortable, discomfiting awareness (not, strictly speaking an emotion)‚Äîa poignant self-consciousness. There is a dis- or mal-connection between an experience and its meaning. It can strike during the most mundane activities such as walking to a house of prayer, standing in a medical emergency room, or queuing for the bus. ==A person becomes aware‚Äîof their own doing, thinking, or loving, as if observing from afar, but it not making sense.== This sense of absurdity is experienced as dissonance, and in extremis may manifest as psychosis.\n\t\t- Absurdity is also the moment we look at ourselves without sentiment and quizzically understand our pretensions. Reflection on the absurd experience reveals ==how ephemeral, illusory, and fanciful the activities are that we hold so precious.== The facades we erect in our lives‚Äîa great curriculum vitae, impressive lecture-circuit credits, a fabulous income‚Äîall amount to naught since the impersonal cosmos renders our efforts meaningless and insignificant.\n\t- [[Existentialism]]\n\t\t- Existentialism discouraged individuals from feeling obliged to behave in a certain way due to social or cultural dictate. It urged people to create themselves according to their own feelings and thoughts and then act accordingly. Surrealist art also broke with artistic convention and aimed to be ‚Äúauthentic‚Äù in an existentialist sense. Surrealistic art asks the same life and death questions and faithfully reflects the existentialist experience and the philosophy of the absurd.\n\t- Conclusion: \n\t\t- During the second part of the nineteenth century changes were afoot in Europe. Society was beginning to swing from organized religion to individualism. Before this children grew up with a religious catechism and were taught what to think. Existentialists stated that instead we should first ask ourselves‚Äîwhat do I feel? Without a theological framework many questions arose, along with a sense of disorientation or dread. This was ‚Äúthe existential attitude or crisis,‚Äù which concluded that ==the world has no absolute meaning and life is absurd. ==The mortal question then became: what is the meaning of my life?\n\t\t\t- History repeats with institutional conditioning...from religion to media\n\t\t- Surrealist artists and philosophers of the absurd responded to the challenge of existentialism and confirmed that the quest for meaning is fraught with paradoxes and inconsistencies. However they also suggested a way to overcome the fear of death and emptiness of life‚Äîby grasping the life-filled moment, seeing it through, and struggling out the other side‚Äîif not happy, at least satisfied.\n- [The Anarchy and Absurdity of ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt Hug Me I‚Äôm¬†Scared‚Äô](https://jackalexandergodwin.wordpress.com/2016/07/07/the-anarchy-and-absurdity-of-dont-hug-me-im-scared/)\n- ['Horrifyingly absurd': how did millennial comedy get so surreal?](https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/aug/13/how-did-millennial-comedy-get-so-surreal)\n\t- How did millennial comedy end up so disorientating, dark and strange? One explanation for all this un-realism is that it‚Äôs a response to a world that has stopped making sense. Philosophical absurdism argues that the universe is inherently irrational ‚Äì a perspective rendered particularly apt by the unpredictable political developments of the past few years. But there‚Äôs something unique about millennials‚Äô lot that contributes to this sense of meaninglessness. In 2017, the Washington Post asked: ‚ÄúWhy is millennial humor so weird?‚Äù, positing the theory that ==as the economic climate has delayed milestones such as marriage, kids and home ownership, and external sources of meaning such as religion have faded away, life has started to feel unpleasantly rootless== ([[Alienation]]), something that is being reflected in a stranger, more chaotic form of comedy.\n\t- ==This sense that the world is constantly, and violently, shifting echoes the feel of the internet==...[for instance,] the Adult Swim school of comedy is designed to ‚Äúreflect the frenetic distribution of information on the internet ‚Äì that‚Äôs why a lot of their shows are so chaotic and absurd.‚Äù Yet the internet has also revolutionised humour on a molecular level. Online, comedy has been evolving in double-time, twisting itself to fit the demands of the medium ‚Äì namely its insatiable desire for immediate, easily digestible content. Not only is there no time for narrative online, there is rarely room for the traditional set-up/punchline structure either. Instead, things are funny because they are wilfully jarring and strange. As those on the right wavelength (and, perhaps, in the right age bracket) will know, however, internet-shaped humour is also characterised by a straightforward silliness, machine-tooled to pierce the panic-inducing online news cycle.\n- [Embedded Realities and Simulacra: A Close Reading of  DHMIS](https://www.academia.edu/18804881/Embedded_Realities_and_Simulacra_A_Close_Reading_of_Don_t_Hug_Me_I_m_Scared_)\n\t- This series canbe studied with respect to a whole new emerging genre of disturbing viral videos that aim to shock and distract, by means of intriguing and make onequestion his/ her sense of self in the perceived reality for the duration of the shorts\n\t- the series' overall presentation as a parody of children's TV show, functioning as an elaborate metaphor for the loss of innocence from childhood to adulthood in society ingeneral\n\t- Self, Anxiety and Mediated Reality\n\t\t- The post-modern condition, if it is to be characterised by the many crisis, the crisis of identity and knowledge is particularly pertinent to this series.\n\t\t- power is negotiated through the characters√ï developmentthrough the episodes and their gradual increase of knowledge of self, inopposition with the various forces that sought to entrap them.\n\t\t- Other forces that shape one√ïs indentity are also explored. In Episode 1,creativity is taught to the puppets by a talking sketchbook in a rather cheerfuland encouraging manner, until things got out of hand (involving gore and out-of-body experiences) and ended with the sketchbook claiming \"let's all agreeto not be creative again\", suggesting the paradox of creativity -- that it is exists within limiting boundaries that is often imposed arbitrarily, by society and/ orindividuals, represented by the sketchbook, which assumes the role of the \"curator\" of creativity. The arbitrariness of such confines is illustrated by its proclaiming that \"green is not a creative colour\" and pouring black paint over Yellow Guy's detailed painting of a clown, denying him his efforts. Pelling, oneof the series creators, when asked about how the film came about, said thatthe purpose was, ironically, \"how not to teach something\" and \"how an abstract concept like creativity is kind of stupid when people try to teach it in alimited way that [they] do\".\n- [Textual Analysis of DHMIS](https://connormcgoochana2media.wordpress.com/2015/06/24/textual-analysis-of-dont-hug-me-im-scared-becky-sloan-and-joseph-pelling/)\n\t- Initially the title is contradictory in its grammatical structure since must people would want to be hugged when scared; the title may be carrying the same message as the narrative: a good thing (creativity) having the opposite result to what was originally intended. Moreover, the appearance of a children‚Äôs TV show creates an¬†**innocent and naive atmosphere**¬†which in turns forms enigma codes as it completely juxtaposes the title ‚Äì why be ‚Äò[s]cared‚Äô in a safe environment.\n- [Albert Camus on why accepting absurdity is the start of a fruitful life](https://bigthink.com/thinking/camus-fruitful-revolt/)\n\t- Camus argues that awareness and acceptance of absurdity tends to drive people towards ‚Äúrevolt,‚Äù a ==feeling of rage and defiance towards the situation we‚Äôre in and a powerful drive to resist being broken by it.== This encourages us to affirm a better existence.\n\t- ‚Äú‚Ä¶man sees freedom in a new light. Freedom is no longer seen as coming from God or some transcendent being or idea, ==nor is it freedom to work toward some future goal.== Rather, freedom is now seen as founded on ==the certainty of death and the absurd.== With the realization that man has only this present life as a certainty and with the further realization that no transcendent beyond this life is admissible, comes the freedom and release to live the present life fully. This does not negate consideration for the future, but it does not allow the future to rob man of his present.‚Äù\n\t- Camus suggests that revolt often leads to what he terms ‚Äúrebellion,‚Äù which inspires us to seek a unity beyond absurdity and realize that everybody faces the same difficulties in the face of it.\n- [Film Theory: Don't Hug Me I'm Scared DECODED!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAa4aI5wKLo)\n- [Capitalism, the Absurd System: A View from the United States](https://monthlyreview.org/2010/06/01/capitalism-the-absurd-system-a-view-from-the-united-states/#:~:text=Capitalism%2C%20as%20an%20economic%2C%20political,to%20the%20future%20of%20humanity.)\n\t- Capitalism, as an economic, political, and social system based on private ownership, directed to the greatest possible profits for particular individuals and corporations, is, in our day, entirely absurd.

What starts as a comedic parody of these programmes explodes into scenes of violence, gore, and warped realities.\"\n\t\t\t- Example: \"Green is not a creative color.\" Co-creator¬†[Joe Pelling said](http://flicksandthecity.com/interviews-short-film-directors-sundance-london/)¬†the idea for this first episode came from the idea that ‚Äòan abstract concept like creativity is a bit stupid when people try to teach it in a limited way‚Äô.\n\t\t- \"In a similar fashion, the show itself is resistant to interpretation of an allegorical nature. Just as you think it might be¬†coming to its own moral¬†or¬†intellectual lesson ‚Äì¬†it falls back into the absurd. Negating that build-up to realisation with gestures of irreverence taps into the¬†anarchic glee at the centre of the best comedy. It‚Äôs expectation¬†and surprise, set-up to reversal ‚Äì¬†a horrifying magic trick.\"\n\t- Meaningless\n\t\t- Camus' Philosophy of the Absurd argues that life is meaningless, a.k.a. inherently futile.

Introduction\n\t1. Hook: evolution in sci-fi\n\t\t1. As a genre rooted in possibility, science fiction is driven forward by the belief that norms are changeable. \n\t\t2. And this applies to people the most; one of the premises Gunn's worldview of science fiction is built on is that humanity is adaptable. \n\t\t3. In fact, it could be argued that adaptation is our responsibility. \"Certainly the good old days...can be appreciated, but science fiction, in its forward-thinking attitude, will recognize that the good old days were never really that good and that change is necessary for growth of the species.\"\n\t2. What better way to critique human norms then through speculative human evolution? \n\t\t1. Many science fiction texts like to ponder on hypothetical pasts, (Where do we come from?),  presents (Who else is living with us?), and futures (What will happen to us?). \n\t\t2. But all of these speculations are grounded in our reality; what these texts are really questioning is  who we already are as humans. \n\t3. The best example of this is the mutant metaphor, wherein people born with extraordinary powers are utilized to signify real-world conditions of marginalization and oppression.\n\t6. So in this essay, I will be exploring how evolution serves as a framework for science fiction through two examples of mutants: The X-Men series' Homo superior and *Sense8*'s Homo sensorium. \n2. Homo superior\n\t1. The X-Men's version of mutantdom\n\t\t1. The X-Men \"the next step in evolution\"\n\t\t2. Nova: superpowers\n\t2. How does the series display and hyperbolize evolution? (signifier)\n\t\t1. HOXPOX: organic technology\n\t\t\t1. The Five: resurection protocols... they're cheating death\n\t\t\t2. language and biology?\n\t\t2. Planet-Size X-Men: superpowered terraforming\n\t\t\t1. they're cheating nature \"we can do this in a day\"\n\t3. How does the series use evolution to explore its themes? (signified)\n\t\t1. HOXPOX\n\t\t\t1. Mutants vs humans-machines\n\t\t\t\t1. [[Cards/Red Queen Hypothesis|Red Queen Hypothesis]]\n\t\t\t\t2. [[Cards/Evolutionary Arms Race|Evolutionary Arms Race]]\n\t\t\t\t3. [[Cards/Transhumanism]]\n\t\t2. Planet-Size X-Men\n3. Homo sensorium\n\t1. Sense8's version of mutantdom\n\t2. How does the series display and hyperbolize evolution? (signifier)\n\t\t1. [[Umwelt]] and [[Cards/Cognition|Cognition]]: shared experience\n\t3. How does the series use evolution to explore its themes? (signified)\n\t\t1. BPO's purpose and the [[Cards/Competitive Exclusion Principle|Competitive Exclusion Principle]]\n4. Comparison\n\t1. While the X-Men series and Sense8 both exemplify the mutant metaphor, they take nearly opposing approaches.\n\t2. First, their portrayal of the mutation novum is on opposite sides of the spectrum. Sense8's setting can be seen as an precise recreation of the author's [a.k.a. the Wachowskis] own environment; sensates can easily pass as normal humans because of the subtle nature of their abilities.  Meanwhile, the X-Men universe has an exclusive interest in [mutants]; flashy abilities not only put mutants in the spotlight, but also empower them to literally make space for themselves (by creating a new country and planet).\n\t3. Next, the powers gained from mutantdom differ in terms of mechanics. The X-Men series takes an individualist orientation; power is an inborn talent, and some mutants are born more powerful than others, as seen with Omega-level mutants. Meanwhile, Sense8 has a collectivist lens; instead of an acquired superpower, the power of a sensate comes from actual connection between other people.  \n\t\t2. semiotically rich? (or talk about this in their own paragraphs)\n\t\t\t1. gifts v..s. weapons\n\t\t\t2. empathy?\n\t4. Finally, in their messaging, they propose contrasting pathways towards a better world for the marginalized.   \n\t\t1. division v.s. connection/integration?\n\t\t2. Given how the sensate mindlink signifies empathy, Sense8 believes that connection is the way to go: \"...the best way to heal the world isn‚Äôt to beat any one bad guy...[or]any one awful ideology, but, rather, to find better ways to care for each other...[and] to love each other.\" Hence, the finale was the perfect ending to the series; what better way to celebrate an interconnected and inclusive world than an orgy, where people of differing races, genders, sexualities, etc. got to enjoy themselves together?\n\t\t4. However, Krakoan era X-Men would see this perspective as naive. It questions why the marginalized need to be good in order to assert their humanity, and argues that there is no need for them to. Charles Xavier advocated for goodness, and that got him nothing but doomed timelines. So instead of trying to integrate with the rest of the world, the X-Men give up and create their own, exclusive to mutants only. \n\t\t5. Mutants are not new species. but its seems like the x-men want to become their own.\n\t\t\t1. With this chosen path, it could be said that mutants are trying to become their own species. Contrary to popular belief, mutants are not a distinct species; in order to be considered as one, they would have to be reproductively isolated from the rest of humanity, which would require geophysical barriers. By creating their own country and planet, the X-Men could be considered moving towards speciation.  \n\t\t6. Overall: in a diversified world, humans make sense of themselves and others through classification. Both texts explored this need for groups to develop their own identities, albeit in conflicting ways. Sense8 advocates for our shared humanity in spite of our biodiversity (\"We are still human\")  while the X-Men series pushes an us-versus-them mentality (\"We are more than human\").\n5. Conclusion\n\t1. a story about where you think we're going is really a statement about where you think we are now, and about our response to that. If you believe we will become better people in the future, that's also a belief that in the present, we¬†_can_.\n\t2. but the question is...how will we get there?\n\t3. If science fiction stories are really statements about our reality, then what do these series say about us?\n\n##### Sources\n- https://www.proquest.com/openview/0037939df3181bd1f1399860ed428ef2/1?pq-origsite=gscholar\u0026cbl=1820923","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.735605378Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2023-07-23":{"title":"2023-07-23","content":"‚Äî-\ntitle: ‚Äú2023-07-23‚Äù\n‚Äî-\nRelated to [[Atlas/Projects/CHI Paper|CHI Paper]] and [[Atlas/Projects/Thesis|Thesis]]\n## Research  \n### Ideas\n- Study\n\t- Collect data then make speculative design from it\n\t- How to do ethnography digitally? \n\t- Maybe through Interviews and field observations?\n\t\t- Engineers imaginaries were studied in a similar way\n\t- Or foresight research (a.k.a. semi-structured interviews with experts) supplemented with desk research\n\t\t- As seen in postcards from the future \n\t\t- Con: would require a specific focus already (future of work perhaps?

There is something that isn‚Äôt quite in your ordinary experience yet it is related to your ordinary experience.\n\t- Related to [[Cards/Cognition|Cognition]] and [[Cards/Estrangement|Estrangement]] in science fiction\n\t- art is connected to what we experience every day, but it represents some kind of transformation of the everyday, something that is not actually entirely real. It can‚Äôt be found by locating it. It requires human intervention. It is the fingerprint, if you will, of our existence in the world that has its impact on things we transform through the use  of  our imagination.\n\t- For example, music: We can identify when it starts and when it ends and we have a pretty good idea of how it is organized. Now that is totally artificial.\n\t- This is completely fictive. It ==doesn‚Äôt have a real place in the world==, even when we try to be realistic.\n\t- Go to a museum and you‚Äôll look at a painting, a genre painting or a historical painting, which depicts a scene that you think is really quite realistic. Someone is fighting a battle. A person is looking out a window or you‚Äôre looking at a landscape which you actually perhaps have seen yourself, but ==that frame is very artificial and we allow ourselves to be caught up in the illusion of its realism.== It isn‚Äôt really out there. It isn‚Äôt real. It‚Äôs somebody‚Äôs imagination of what is real. \n\t\t- The perfect example is TV, video and film where we get caught up in a storyline that may take years and centuries. It seems real to us. The whole thing is only an hour and a half long, but it has the ==illusion of realism== and that is the ==artificial manipulation of our sensibilities== through the work of an artist.\n- **Art v.s. taste**\n\t- There's a continuum\n\t- Art is about the beautiful...which is subjective\n\t- Often pegged as something elitist\n\t- One of the important things about what makes a work of art is the power of the human imagination to predict something\n\t- Most of what we think is art is the result of people thinking about doing something and being carried away by either some plan or some intuition or some imagination\n\t- so the child‚Äôs finger painting is probably distinguishable from Jackson Pollock by its structure, its composition, its intent, its design.\n- **Art-making is distinctly human**\n\t- From the Greeks...gods didn't make art, but we made art about the gods\n- **Art as communication**\n\t- Art is really the attempt to communicate through time and in space a work, statement, or event that has some coherence that is both connected to and estranged from everyday experience\n\t- It creates a vocabulary of sensibility, a vocabulary of interpretation, a vocabulary of meaning that in one sense is beyond that of language.\n- **Art transcends language**\n\t- Very important about art is that it is not restricted to language. There is art in language.\n\t- much of art and much of the art that we care about responds to something other than the linguistic. We talk about it in language, but our experience transcends language \n\t- Many philosophers have argued that the visual and particularly musical reaches an individual in a different way, not through the medium of language and therefore is not entirely rational. It‚Äôs not something that we can say is right or wrong. When we say we‚Äôre moved by a work of art or that we‚Äôre inspired by a work of art we often find it hard to put that in words. of it is somehow around language. It bypasses language.\n- **The role of art in human life**\n\t- The most important public art of all is architecture\n\t- Both a public and private endeavor\n\t- Art is not only the enterprise of the individual art maker; it is also about how we live our lives in the public circumstance\n\t- *Public art lies at the intersection of communal living and private experience* \n- **Engaging with art gives us purpose**\n\t- Art is not merely the act of an individual who exceeds his/her boundaries of experience in ways we cannot predict\n\t- Art is never something that has to exist\n\t\t- E.G. Science: discovering something that is out there\n\t\t- Meanwhile, in art, what is created has no reason to exist. This is what makes art significant to the individual. It is a reminder both to the maker of the art and the audience of their uniqueness in the world\n\t- In the past, we thought our primary existence was for labor. Labor that could be rewarded so that we could survive\n\t- God was a creator. He used language to create. We also use language to create...we have the capacity to create\n\t- Art can be dangerous because it doesn't follow rules; it rarely follows rules\n\t- The important thing about art, in both its making and its absorption, is that it requires ==engagement==. \n\t\t- We invent ourselves\n\t- *Art allows us to create identities in a world where we can't make a practical impact*\n\t- We join communities for the sake of purpose....art does the same thing...we follow someone else's imagination\n\t- Is there an objective scale of artistic quality?\n\t\t- Political value does not equal to truth value\n- **So what constitutes quality in art?**\n\t- Taste changes with time\n\t\t- E.G. artists becoming popular post-mortem\n- **Art and society**\n\t- Art has usually been an avenue of dissent...a place of last resort, the last refuge of freedom\n\t- Art, is in its core, a social activity. It is an activity in which individuals seek to communicate\n\t\t- Which is why it can be viewed as dangerous by political regimes\n- **Art as social criticism**\n\t- Much of art in societies is patronized by wealthy individuals\n\t- Jean-Jacques Rousseau: \"Art allows us to be complacent with injustice\"\n\t- Not clear that art is constructive, always about freedom, indivuduality, etc.\n\t\t- The values it puts forward aren't always defensible\n\t- At the core of this question: \"Is there a relationship between what art does and the good?\"\n- **Is art inherently good?**\n\t- Leo Tolstoy: \"Beauty isn't the issue; it's the problem\"\n\t\t- Tolstoy: *Art should emphasize that we all the same in God's eyes*\n\t\t- But he was also suspicious of individuality, and in turn art\n\t- The performing arts cannot be standardized. The work (of music, theatre, dance, etc.) is in its ==presence==\n\t- The more sophisticated our society becomes, the more instruments of diffrentiation that we accumulate\n\t\t- Art recognizes our interdependence and equality\n\t- *Art redeems the sanctity of the individual*\n\t\t- When you deepen the sanctity of life, you create some potential of resistance\n\t- The making of art is an exceptional reflection of ambition and courage\n- **Ars longa vita brevis**\n\t- The impulse to create art....is worthy of study\n\t- When you're studying art, don't just do it passively (e.g. art history). Take up a craft yourself\n\t- The most important thing about art is the capacity of the human to make it\n\n### A History of Art in Three Colours (Gold)\n- Now that we have laid the foundations of our approach regarding our inquiry and exploration of art, we can move on to a more elaborate example.\n- The following material below outlines for us the long and rich history of gold as an artistic element employed throughout the ages.\n- Try to apply what you have learned so far in understanding its use, significance, symbolism, and legacy in relation to art and history.\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkLn_4xBaMk\n---\n- We've often used gold to revere the things we've found most sacred (e.g. royalty)\n- We first fell in love with gold because of how it looked...it reminded us of the sun\n- Ancient Egyptians had tons of access to gold because of their territory\n- Original: fine threads\n\n\n### Art of the Western World: The Classical Ideal\nOur journey continues with an introduction to the notion of the classical ideal, and culminates with the decline of the Roman empire.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgWno9NMGks\n---\n- The human form and mind attain to a perfection in Greece\n- They created personal museums for idealizing values like reason, liberty, and justice\n","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.735605378Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2023-08-18":{"title":"2023-08-18","content":"‚Äî-\ntitle: ‚Äú2023-08-18‚Äù\n‚Äî-\n## SocSci 14\n#politics \n### Types of Power\n- **[[Compulsory power]]**\n\t- Robert Dahl: ‚ÄúA has power over B to the extent that he can get B to do something that B would not otherwise do‚Äù\n\t- Here, power is a matter of prevailing in a situation and is viewed as a ==zero-sum game==. When someone ‚Äúwins‚Äù (i.e. gets what they want), someone also has to lose.\n\t- ‚ÄúPower is also exercised when A devotes his energies to creating or reinforcing social and political values and institutional practices that limit the scope of the political process to public consideration of only those issues which are comparatively innocuous to A.‚Äù\n\t- Compulsion is not just about us telling someone what to do. We are also compelled by someone when we are told what *not* to do. In other words, compulsory power is also a form of *setting the agenda* for someone else.\n- **[[Institutional power]]**\n\t- Whereas compulsory power entails the direct control of one actor of the conditions and actions of another, **institutional power is actors‚Äô control of others in indirect ways.** Specifically, the conceptual focus here is on the formal and informal institutions that mediate between A and B, as A, working through the rules and procedures that define those institutions, guides, steers, and constrains the actions (or non-actions) and conditions of existence of others, sometimes even unknowingly.\n- **[[Structural power]]**\n\t- Structural power concerns the structures ‚Äî or, more precisely, the co-constitutive, internal relations of structural positions ‚Äî that define what kind of social beings actors are.\n\t- Whereas institutional power focuses on the constraints on interest-seeking action, structural power concerns the ==determination of social capacities and interests==\n\t- One, structural positions ==do not generate equal social privileges==; instead structures allocate differential capacities, and typically differential advantages, to different positions. \n\t\t- Capital-labor and master-slave relations are obvious examples of how social structures constitute unequal social privileges and capacities. \n\t- Two, the social structure not only constitutes actors and their capacities; it also ==shapes their self-understanding and subjective interests.== \n\t- In other words, structural power can work to constrain some actors from recognizing their own domination. To the degree that it does, actors‚Äô self understandings and dispositions for action serve to reproduce, rather than to resist, the differential capacities and privileges of structures\n- **[[Productive power]]**\n\t- The constitution of all social subjects with various social powers through systems of knowledge and discursive practices of broad and general social scope\n\t- As Foucault explained, ==power lies at the bottom of all our social practices.== \n\t\t- All actions and interactions, no matter how big or small, constitute what he calls ‚Äú[[Relations of power]]‚Äù. \n\t\t- The aim of the relations of power is to continuously determine and flesh out the subjectivity of individuals. \n\t\t- A simple way to think of [[Subjectivity]] is to think of it as ==the way we identify ourselves and other people and our place in the social world.==\n\t- E.G. Filipino‚Äôs weak nationalism due to long history of colonization\n\t- Productive power differs from structural power in its approach to subjectivity. Because structural power concerns the constitution of subjects, it typically envisiions hierarchial and binary relations of domination that work to the advantage of those structurally empowered to the disadvantage of the socially weak. \n\t- In contrast, productive power concerns the boundaries of all social identity, and the capacity and inclination for action of the socially advantaged and disadvantaged alike, as well as the myriad social subjects that are not constituted in binary hierarchical relationships\n\t- TL;DR Difference: You can gain more power based on the ==structure (structural)==, or based on your ==identity (productive)==\n\n### From Power to Resistance\n- Power and resistance are mutually implicated because of the social relations that shape the ability of actors to control their own fates are frequently challenged and resisted by those on the ‚Äúreceiving end‚Äù. \n- This does not mean, of course, that all actors are continuously engaged in every circumstance to achieve that ultimately impossible condition that Foucault critiqued as the ‚Äúfully sovereign subject‚Äù. \n- **But there is a ==human inclination== to resist in the face of power and to seek greater capacity to influence the social forces that define them and their parameters of action, at least in the modern condition.**\n\t- Related to Aesthetics class lecture and [[Modernism]]\n- Going back to Kerkvilet‚Äôs book, what type of power was established in Lita‚Äôs situation?","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.735605378Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2023-08-23":{"title":"2023-08-23","content":"‚Äî-\ntitle: ‚Äú2023-08-23‚Äù\n‚Äî-\n## Practice Teaching\n#education \n**Teacher (and learner) roles from traditional approaches**\n- If the teacher is an ==expert==‚Ä¶\n\t- The learner is a ==sponge==\n- If the teacher is a ==performer==‚Ä¶\n\t- The learner is an ==audience==\n- If the teacher is an ==inspector==‚Ä¶\n\t- The learner is a ==product==\n**Teacher (and learner) roles from *Learning by Refraction*\n- If the teacher is a ==designer== of learning environment and experience (instead of an expert)‚Ä¶\n\t- Every class will be designed so that learning would happen\n\t- What students know of the topic will also come out\n\t- The learner becomes an ==inquirer==\n- If the teacher is a ==facilitator== of reflection and meaning-making (instead of a performer)‚Ä¶\n\t- The classroom is a stage; everyone has a role to play so that they can shine\n\t- The learner becomes a ==meaning-maker==\n- If the teacher is a ==coach== of transfer learning (instead of an inspector)‚Ä¶\n\t- Learning is more than pass or fail\n\t- The learner becomes a ==creator==\n**What does *Cura Personalis* mean here?\n- Curriculum centered on the person rather than the material to be covered\n- Of equal importance is the self-discipline expected of each student, shown in the intellectual rigor and serious study\n- Responsible use of freedom.

Do the students have the prior learning necessary to accomplish the objective?\n- **Relevant -**¬†Does the objective address the overall program goal(s)? Will the objective have an impact on the goal(s)?\n- **Time-Bound -**¬†A learning objective should include a specific date (or point in the course) by which it will be completed. It is important to allow enough time to successfully implement the steps needed to achieve the objective, but not so much as to elicit procrastination.\n\n![[Extras/Media/Images/SMART Objectives.png]]\n\nTo understand this approach in writing objectives better, you may want to consult¬†[this document from Stanford University.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-rh1VjA_C_deHbkp2hTBlzEO6ARcaK3Kr1fVAW_qKMg/edit#heading=h.yh52zcc4j5jf)\n\n#### Learning Objective Verbs for [[Cards/Blooms Taxonomy|Blooms Taxonomy]]\n**Learning Objective Verbs at Each Bloom Taxonomy Level**\n![[Extras/Media/Images/LO Verbs for Blooms Taxonomy.png]]\n\n#### Tips on Writing Objectives\nIn our session, you will be asked to write learning objectives for your lessons. Here are some tips to prepare you:\n\n- **_Try to write instructional objectives for every topic in every course you teach_.**¬†Consider taking a gradual approach: formulating good objectives for a course may take some time.  \n- **_Include some objectives at the three highest levels of_¬†_Bloom's Taxonomy_**. Analysis, synthesis, and evaluation questions can and should be included in every course, but they rarely show up in undergraduate courses. They are not that hard to write, but if you don't consciously set out to write some, you probably won't.  \n- **Avoid beginning an instructional objective with any of these four words:¬†_know, learn, appreciate_, and¬†_understand_.** These may be the ultimate goals of instruction but they are not valid instructional objectives, since ==you cannot directly observe whether they have been achieved.== Think of what you will ask the students to¬†_do_¬†to demonstrate their knowledge or understanding, and make those activities the instructional objectives for that topic.\n\nFormulating detailed instructional objectives for a course or even for a single topic in a course is not nearly as easy as simply listing the course topics in a syllabus.

common during the Renaissance\n- ==Specialized societies== sometimes preserve technical information important in the training of artists, and regulate art making (e.g. guilds)\n- ==**Art academies**== are a more recent invention for the training of artists, where systematized art instruction occurred within the classroom\n- Art academies typically:\n\t- Provide art training for students\n\t- Sponsor lectures in theory and set standards\n\t- Accept mature artists as members\n- In part, academies helped break the power of the guilds, which to some extent were stifling innovation because their rigid regulations imposed uniformity upon their members\n\n##### Context of Art Making\n- **Workshops:** businesses composed of apprentices, assistants, and specialists who operate under the name of a master artist\n- **Community Art Making:** large groups of people contribute directly to art production\n- **Hiring out the making of art:** artists hire others to make their artwork\n- **Artist as Object Maker:** individual artists make their own artwork (expected norm)\n- **Collaborations:** art making becomes a collaborative activity among different artists\n\n##### The Role of Artists in Various Cultures\n- The ==artist‚Äôs position in society== reflects how that culture uses art, how it values art, and what it expects the artist to do as a member\n\t- In some cultures, certain art objects are made by men and others by women; this usually ==reflects the different roles, rights, and responsibilities of males and females within==\n- Artists are seen as ==skilled workers or laborers==\n- Art and artists can also gain inspiration from other fields such as science, and are thus ==viewed as scientists==, to a certain extent\n- Art is often the ==vehicle of spirituality==, and thus the artist is sometimes seen as also being a holy person, priest, or shaman\n- Meanwhile, in Europe, the concept of the ==artist as a creative genius== began to emerge during the Renaissance; 14th century Europe\n\t- Prior to that time, artist were mainly considered as ==skilled laborers/workers==\n\t- During the ==Romantic Era==, the emphasis on freedom, uniqueness, feeling, individuality, and imagination augmented this view\n\n##### Support for Art Making\n- Even though art is essential to a culture, it is an activity that ==can occur only when the is some kind of surplus== ‚Äî time, food, or money\n- Three ways to support art making ‚Äî direct support, commissions, and selling works\n- **The Fine Art Market** - artists make works to sell through commercial galleries (auction)\n- **Tourist Market** - works made specifically for tourists; removed from its original context\n- **The Art Collector** - interested in art as an investment, or as a status symbol, while others seem truly taken with the work\n- **Tax-supported art** - National Artist\n- ==‚ÄúNever worship an artist because they aren‚Äôt different from you‚Äù==\n\n#### What Do We Do With Art\n- People use it, through performance or display\n- Cultures or groups keep art because it is meaningful to them and enriches their lives\n##### Four Reasons Why Art is Kept\n- Aesthetic/civilizing/educational purposes\n- Religious reasons\n- Political purposes\n- Commerce\n##### Art Collections\n- Museums and private collections\n- National museums\n- Art museums\n- Regional museums\n- Museums and new technology","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.735605378Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2023-09-05":{"title":"2023-09-05","content":"‚Äî-\ntitle: ‚Äú2023-09-05‚Äù\n‚Äî-\n## SocSci 14\n#politics \n### Politics and Institutions\n#### Institutions\n- Definitions\n\t- An established organization or corporation (such as a bank or university), especially of public character\n\t- A significant practice, relationship, or organization in a society or culture\n\t- An established law, practice, or custom\n- The first discussion for this module must really be about defining **institutions**. The term has been redefined, unpacked, and critiqued so richly that the literature has admittedly become confusing.\n- Two categories: formal and informal\n\t- **Formal institutions** \n\t\t- Normally understood to be ==(written)== laws, regulations, legal agreements, statues, contracts and constitutions ‚Äî the so-called ==‚Äòparchment institutions‚Äô== (Carey, 2000) ‚Äî which are enforced by third parties,\n\t\t- E.G. constitutions, contracts, laws, and forms of government\n\t- **Informal institutions** \n\t\t- Thought of to be as the ==(usually unwritten)== norms, customary practices, standard operating procedures, routines, conventions and traditions (Hall, 1992) which are ==often deeply embedded in culture and its associated ideology==\n\t\t- E.G. traditions, customs, moral values, religious beliefs, and other norms\n- The Kaufmann et. al paper focused on how the private sector views red tape and how red tape is reinforced through/by formal and informal institution\n\t- **‚ÄúRed tape‚Äù** is a perception that governments are too bureaucratic and that governance is too heavily on rules, regulations, and procedures that they become counterproductive, if not a total nuisance\n\t- The paper looks at how the private sector, like business, react to the ==various interactions between formal and informal institutions==\n\n##### What are Institutions?\n- Institutions are best understood as the ==‚Äúrules of the game‚Äù== (North, 1990) which ==shape human behavior in economic, social, and political life== ‚Äî Quite simply, human society is impossible without them.\n- Effective institutions ==provide for predictable and stable patterns of interaction in all walks of life.== So institutions are thus best thought of as durable social rules and procedure, formal and informal, which structure‚Äîbut do not determine‚Äîthe social, economic, and political relations and interactions of those affected\n\n##### Characteristics\n- Institutions, as a set of rules, are not self-generating or self-sustaining ‚Äî and they achieve little on their own. To be effective and sustained, they require ==legitimacy, consistency and compatibility with other institutions, maintenance, implementation, and review.==\n- Economic institutions, as with political and social institutions, are ==social and political constructions== and not simply matters of technical design or administrative arrangement.\n\t- Understanding how institutions are forged, how they evolve, and the conditions which ensure their successful implementation, rather than avoidance or evasion, is therefore fundamental.\n- It is therefore the ==interaction of individuals, organizations and institutions== that is at the heart or the politics and political economy of development, where ‚Äòorganizations‚Äô are understood to be the formally/informally coordinated vehicles for the promotion or protection of a mix of individual and shared interests and/or ideas\n##### Informal Institutions\n- Informal institutions guide human behavior and decision-making processes.\n- Characterizing informal institutions\n\t- **Corruption:** higher levels of corruption usually occur in places with more red tape\n\t- **Political ideology:** more conservative cultures are more critical of government rules and regulations; red tape perceptions tend to be higher in these places\n\t- **Culture:** collectivist societies are more associated with lower ‚Äúred tape‚Äù perception; higher preference for uncertainty avoidance = preference for more rules and regulations, thus making them less likely to consider these as ‚Äúred tape‚Äù\n- \n\n##### Formal Institutions\n- The first hypothesis (H1) is: **‚ÄúThere will be a positive association between ==country-level formalization== and perceptions of red tape in the private sector‚Äù**\n\t- This hypothesis is based on the idea that the more governments formalize processes (or basically create more and more regulations and rules) that the private sector has to follow, the more the private sector will perceive government regulation as undesirable\n- The second hypothesis (H2)\n- This means that the less effective a government\n- The third hypothesis (H3) is: **‚ÄúThere will a positive association between ==federal states== and perceptions of red tape in the private sector‚Äù**\n\t- This means that the private sector is more likely to consider government regulation as undesirable if there is inconsistency in governance across more levels of government (national, state-level, LGU-level, etc.)\n- The fourth hypothesis (H4) is: **‚ÄúThere will be a positive association between ==more conservative political ideology== in a country and perceptions of red tape in the private sector‚Äù.**\n\t- This means that the more a political environment prefers conservative ideologies such as market freedom and ‚Äúsmaller governments‚Äù, the more likely it is that the private sector is to consider government regulation undesirable.\n- The fifth hypothesis (H5) is: **‚ÄúThere is a positive association between ==a country‚Äôs level of corruption== and perceptions of red tape.‚Äù**\n\t- This means that the more corrupt a government is in the eyes of the people, the more likely it is that the private sector will look at government regulation as undesirable\n- The sixth hypothesis (H6a) is: **‚ÄúThere will be a positive association between the ==levels of individualism in a country== and perceptions of red tape.‚Äù**\n\t- This means that individualist cultures, or those that prefer personal autonomy, right above duties, the promotion of self-reliance and self-fulfillment before collective interests are more likely to look at government regulation as undesirable.\n- The seventh hypothesis (H6b) is: **‚ÄúThere will be a *negative* association between ==the level of uncertainty avoidance in a country== and perceptions of red tape in the private sector.‚Äù**\n\t- This means that cultures that have lower levels of uncertainty avoidance are more likely to view government regulation as undesirable. \n\t- Uncertainty avoidance is about a culture‚Äôs openness to change: the less avoidant a culture is, the more open it is to change.\n##### Types of Institutions\nVarious social and political institutions have very specific functions, logics, and systems. Leftwich and Sen identify three general classifications, within which both formal and informal institutions could be observed:\n- **Economic institutions:**\n\t- They are about the definition, acquisition, distribution, and regulation of economic goods, such as property and services.\n\t- Formal elements include laws and policies that govern this portfolio of policy issues\n\t- Informal elements would include gender norms that pertain to rights of property ownership, class systems about access to economic goods, etc.\n- **Political institutions:**\n\t- They are about how power is obtained, used, controlled, and by whom.\n\t- The formal elements would obviously include forms of government, written constitutions, etc.\n\t- Informal elements could include cultures of corruption, familial ties, etc.\n- **Social institutions:** \n\t- They are about society and culture.\n\t- Formal elements would include governments in their capacity to regulate social relationships/behavior.\n\t- Informal elements could include matters on social cohesion, inclusion, gender, generations, and religion.\n\n##### Government Regulation\n- What do these findings say about government regulation?\n\t- As a generalization, the private sector forms preferences and perceptions on how effective or ineffective government is based on key formal and informal institutional dynamics.\n\t- When it comes to formal institutions that constitute what we may call ‚Äúgood governance‚Äù, the private sector looks at government regulation more favorably when government is effective in ascertaining rule of law, more efficient in its lawmaking, and more streamlined in its implementation.\n\t- Informal institutions like cultural depictions of government corruption and political ideology also have been shown to affect perceptions on government regulation\n\t- The more a culture looks at government as corrupt overall, the more likely do people consider government regulation a nuisance\n\t- Lastly, the more a government over-regulates, the more conservative cultures become averse to government regulation. The findings of this paper may have resonance for people who are frustrated with contemporary governance issues\n##### What are Organizations?\n- **Organizations** are the ‚Äúformally or informally co-ordinated vehicles for the promotion or protection of a mix of individual and shared interests and ideas.‚Äù\n- If **institutions are the *rules* of the game, organizations are the *players* of the game.** The two terms could be easily confused as synonyms.\n- Basically, institutions are the formal and informal rules that govern politics. Organizations are the groups the participate in politics.\n- Institutions and Organizations are different but must always be studied and understood as highly related to each other because most social, political, and economic institutions overlap. As a result, how individuals and organizations navigate these institutions becomes a point of necessary inquiry.\n##### How do institutions contribute to social and political change?\n- Kathryn Sikkink and Martha Finnemore begin their article by explaining the shifts in approaches and assumptions made in the study of politics over the last century. They explain that for most of the 20th century, political science was dominated by an American school of thought that meshed together rationalism and realism.\n- With the increases prominence of decolonization and transnational advocacy networks such as the Red Cross and the World Wildlife Fund in the 1970s, the succeeding decades of political science started to take an **‚Äúideational turn‚Äù.**\n- This entailed explaining politics not just in terms of formal processes (i.e. decision-making, governance modes, elections, red tape, etc.) but also constructivist terms.\n- With this ‚Äúideational turn‚Äù came the implication of legitimacy and ideology in the study of politics In simpler terms, the ‚Äúideational turn‚Äù encouraged more critical questions about political processes. Instead of merely ‚Äúwhat works‚Äù in a very functionalist-realist sense, **political scientists started to ask ==‚Äúhow does change really occur‚Äù== in a social constructivist sense.**\n\t- Social constructivism: a sociological theory of knowledge according to which human development is socially situated, and knowledge is constructed through ==interaction with others.== \n\t- Like social [[Constructionism]], social constructivism states that ==people work together to actively construct artifacts.==\n\n###### Norm Life Cycle\nWith this, Sikkink and Finnemore propose their framework called the Norm ‚ÄúLife Cycle‚Äù, which has three stages:\n- **Stage 1: Norm Emergence:** the characteristic mechanism of the first stage is persuasion by *norm* entrepreneurs. They attempt to convince a mass of states (or norm leaders) to embrace their own norms.\n\t- *Norm Entrepreneurs:* norms do not appear out of thin air. They are conceptualized by individuals and groups who have a strong notion of what is appropriate and desirable on their communities. Norms hope to convert society into something the norm entrepreneurs consider ??\n\t\t- These entrepreneurs are important from the very beginning because they are the ones who call attention to issues, and they frame issues into a discourse that calls for urgent change\n\t\t- The goal is for this message to resonate and capture the imagination of the wider public. ==For norms to effectively cascade, communities must understand and believe in the image and condition of the world that the norms aim to create/protect==\n\t\t- In a lot of situations, norm entrepreneurs operate in spaces where other norm entrepreneurs who advocate for opposing ideas and values. The dynamic will look like two or more sides trying to prevent others from winning the public‚Äôs preference.\n\t\t- This **‚Äúnormative contestation‚Äù** is a very important occurrence because new norms attempt to emerge in  political spaces that already have a saturation of other norms.\n\t\t- In simpler terms, ==norm entrepreneurs push for norms in a political space that already has existing standards of what is acceptable, appropriate and desirable.== As such, these new norms they support and fight for hope to change, or even supplant, existing norms.\n\t\t- Some normative projects do not succeed in the normative contestations simply because its entrepreneurs were unable to persuade a critical mass of the public that the norms they push for are better and more desirable than currently dominant norms. However, when norm entrepreneurs do succeed, this is called a *tipping point* or *threshold point*.\n- **Stage 2: Norm Cascade:** Norm leaders socialize other actors with norm entrepreneurs as an attempt to get them to become norm followers. What encourages other actors to become norm followers? Various reasons that include pressure for conformity, desire to enhance international reputation, desire of leaders (i.e. politicians) to enhance reputation/legacy.\n\t- The **key actors in the norm cascade process are states** (national governments), **international organizations** like the UN, and **advocacy networks** like Amnesty International. These three actors work for a greater level of formalization of norms and institutions.\n\t- This process involves a complex dynamic akin to a ‚Äúcontagion‚Äù, which Sikkink and Finnemore call **‚Äúsocialization‚Äù**. This **socialization** process involves ==rich and continuous public debates and discussions that aim to recognize actors== like politicians and states that have effectively worked towards the formalization of new norms and institutions, and ==to ridicule actors== who either are failing to uphold these new standards or are refusing to do so. \n\t- A primary goal of socialization is **conformity**. Countries, organizations, and networks hope that all their preferred norms reach a level of familiarity in the international community that ==everyone just conforms to the norms.==\n\t- As Sikkink and Finnermore point out Axelrod‚Äôs take, they quote: ‚ÄúBy conforming to the actions of those around us, we fulfill a psychological need to be part of a group‚Äù.\n- **Stage 3: Norm Internalization:** norms acquire a ==‚Äútaken-for-granted quality‚Äù== and are ==no longer a contentious issue in the public debate.== Examples: women‚Äôs suffrage, abolition of slavery, immunity of medical personnel during open conflict/war (i.e. Red Cross, Red Crescent, MSF)\n\t- When norms cascade to the point that norms simply become ‚Äútaken-for-granted‚Äù, or that they become so integral to how people live their lives that they don‚Äôt think about them anymore, norm internalization occurs.\n\t- Internalized norms could become both powerful because they are no longer questioned, and very ambivalent because they are no longer as critically examined in the mainstream.\n\t- When norms are ==enshrined in laws, constitutions, and contracts==, they become something for ==compliance==, sometimes thoughtless compliance.\n- Question to think about: *Is the universality of human right a norm that still is in the process of cascade, or is it an internalized norm that is now being challenged by new emerging norms?*\n###### Internalization of Norms\n- **Prominence:** When a state recognizes the effectiveness of some key norms in other prominent and prosperous countries, they are more likely to support the cascade of such norms in their own country\n- **Intrinsic characteristics of the norm:** Norms that are ==clear and specific== are more likely to be more effective in reaching internalization. Norms that ==rest on universalistic claims== also tend to become more influential. An example of a norm that meets both characteristics is the universal rejection of slavery as an acceptable and legitimate economic activity.\n\n\n\n\n## Practice Teaching\n#EDUC130_3 #teaching #education \n### Assessment: Designing Evidences of Learning\n#### What are Assessments?\n- In their handbook for course-based review and assessment, Martha L. A. Stassen et al. define assessment as¬†**‚Äúthe systematic collection and analysis of information to improve student learning**.‚Äù (Stassen et al., 2001, pg. 5)\n- Our own Department of Education (2016) has also defined assessments as follows:\n\t- _**Assessment**¬†is ==the process of measuring learners' progress in the attainment of learning standards and 21st-century skills.== The results of the various forms of assessment shall be used to quantify judgments on learners' academic performance. It is a quality assurance tool to track student progress in the attainment of standards, promote self-reflection and personal accountability for one's learning, and provide a basis for the profiling of student performance._¬†_Thus, it is an integral part of the teaching-learning experience and provides an opportunity to improve teaching strategies inside the classroom._\n- Here are more definitions from literature:\n\t- All activities teachers use to¬†**help students learn and to gauge student progress**¬†(Black \u0026 Williams, 1998)\n\t- **Provides feedback**¬†on the effectiveness of instruction and gives student a measure of their progress (Jabbarifar, 2009)\n\t- The systematic¬†**process of documenting and using empirical data**on the knowledge, skills, attitudes and beliefs to refine programs and improve student learning (Allen, 2004)\n- Do you notice a pattern in these definitions? Here are the things I noticed:\n\t- First, assessments should be ==concrete== and ==facts-based.==\n\t- Second, assessments should be ==useful for both the teacher and the student== - it should be able to provide feedback to the student on how he/she can improve, and it should be able to provide feedback to the teacher on how she/he can improve the learning experiences provided to students.\n\t- Third, assessments are used to check if students have reached the ==learning outcomes== of the module.\n#### Share an Unforgettable Assessment\n- DLQ Final presentation about answering a Life Question\n\nOne assessment that remains unforgettable for me during my stay so far in Ateneo was my final exam for the Discerning Life Questions. For this exam, all that you needed to do was answer one of your Life Questions in a 10-15 minute presentation to the teacher, using the insights you got from class. It was definitely memorable for many (including me) because this gave us the opportunity to process things we usually swept under the rug; my best friend‚Äôs life question was about why she couldn‚Äôt forgive her mother, while my life question was about why I had such a toxic relationship with dance. Honestly, the whole process felt like a therapy session: from uncovering deep traumas while outlining my script, to pouring my heart out to my teacher while doing my presentation. It was truly cathartic, and the way my teacher validated me after (i.e. pointing out the good characteristics I couldn‚Äôt see amidst my self-hatred) still makes me emotional to this day. I‚Äôll definitely keep DLQ lessons close to my heart for the rest of my life.\n\n#### Purpose of Assessments\n- Different types of assessments can help you understand student progress in various ways.¬†\n- In your classroom, assessments generally have one of three purposes: Assessment¬†**_of_**¬†learning, Assessment¬†**_for_**¬†learning, and Assessment¬†_**as**_¬†learning. If we look at assessment in terms of these these perspectives, we get to understand what assessments are for, and who is it for.\n\t- **Assessment OF learning:** occurs when teachers use evidence of student learning to make judgements on student achievement against goals and standards\n\t- **Assessment FOR learning:** occurs when teachers use inferences about student progress to inform their teaching\n\t- **Assessment AS learning:** occurs when students reflect on and monitor their progress to inform their future learning goals\n- Now, look back into your experiences as students. What were the \"assessments for learning\", ¬†\"assessments as learning\", and \"assessments of learning\" implemented by your former teachers? \n- So based on this perspective comes two major types of assessments commonly implemented by teachers in the classroom - ==formative assessments and summative assessments.== What is the difference between the two? Watch this [video]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xb609JC3_QU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xb609JC3_QU)) to learn more.\n- Teachers do not need to wait until the end of the lesson to find out if students are having difficulties in understanding the lesson. She/he can use a variety of strategies such as practice exercises, asking questions, etc, which we can collectively call¬†**formative assessments.**¬†Its main purpose is to ==find out if students are on track.== \n- At the end of the lesson, unit, or module, teachers need to collect evidence (such as exit tickets, reflection, or a graded quiz) that students indeed reached the objectives of the lesson, unit, or module. These assessments are called¬†**summative assessments**.\n#### Evidence of Learning\n- **What type of assessments do I use as evidence of learning?**\n- The **[[Understanding by Design]]** framework recommends for teachers to look at the skills and knowledge that the lesson, module or course is striving to develop among its students in terms of curricular priorities:\n\t- **What is worth being familiar with? What skills and knowledge are important to know and do? And lastly, what¬†[enduring understandings](https://iteachu.uaf.edu/enduring-understandings/)¬†should be developed?**\n\n![[Curricular Priorities.png]]\n\n\u003e **[[Enduring Understandings]] are the insights that a learner gains by doing the work of understanding, i.e. making connections in our learning that help us make sense of and integrate new knowledge into existing understandings.¬†(Wiggins and McTighe, 2003).**\n\n- **After we have identified these curricular priorities,¬† we choose what type of assessments to use.**\n\t- What are these performance tasks and projects?\n\n![[Curricular Priorities and Assessment Methods.png]]\n\n#### Performance Tasks\n- An evidence of student learning are what we call¬†**performance tasks.**\n- **Performance tasks** are¬†_engaging and worthy problems or questions of importance, in which students must use knowledge to fashion performances effectively and creatively. The tasks are either ==replicas or analogous to the kinds of problems faced by adult citizens and consumers or professionals in the field==? (Wiggins, 2010)_\n- In their 2005 book,¬†_Understanding by Design_, education scholars, Grant Wiggins and Jay McTighe, advocate for a different approach to assessment that ==delineates between performance tasks assessments and more traditional forms of assessment.== More traditional forms of assessment, or ‚Äúacademic prompts‚Äù as Wiggins and McTighe call them:\n\t- Require students to think critically,\n\t- Involve analysis, and evaluation,\n\t- Usually only occur in academic environments.\n- While performance task assessments:\n\t- Attempt to simulate problems and situations that arise in a multitude of work environments not limited to academic environments;\n\t- Allow students to personalize the required product (a project, performance, etc.) to their own interests and/or learning objectives; and\n\t- Usually require the student to address an audience other than the instructor.\n#### Overview of Test Item Types\n- **What are the different types of test items?** There are many assessment types and the assessment type we choose would depend on the curricular priorities.\n- Objective test items have two main categories: selected response items and constructed response items.\n\t- **Selected response test items**¬†already contain the answer and all the student has to do is to select the correct answer\n\t\t- Alternative Response\n\t\t- Matching Exercises\n\t\t- Multiple Choice\n\t- **Constructed response test items**¬†only gives a prompt, and students are expected to generate their own answer(s)\n\t\t- Completion/Supply Items/Short Response\n\t\t- Essay\n\n##### **Why do we need to have guidelines in writing tests?**\n- Before we move on the specific guidelines, at this point, it is important to ask this question, \"Why do we need to have guidelines? Why can't we just go ahead and write the test questions based on what I know as a content expert?\"\n- The purpose of tests is ==to capture what the students know - if he/she have actually attained the objectives of the unit or course.== \n\t- It ensures that the test we create is¬†**valid - The term validity refers to whether or not the test measures what it claims to measure. On a test with high validity the items will be closely linked to the test's intended focus.**¬†¬†\n\t- So, if the tests we create is unable to do that, then we cannot assume that the results of the test represent what he/she actually knows.¬†\n\t- Several organizations have put forth guidelines and this is collectively called¬†[Universal Test Design](https://www.testpublishers.org/assets/documents/volume%206%20issue%201%20Creating%20%20better%20tests.pdf). You may read the link to find out more.\n##### **How do we write acceptable test items?**\nFrom the CONSTRUCTING DIFFERENT TEST ITEM TYPES pdf\n\n1. Suggestions for constructing **alternative response items**:\n\t1. Avoid broad general statements.\n\t2. Avoid trivial statements.\n\t3. Avoid the use of negative statements, and especially double negatives.\n\t4. Avoid long, complex sentences.\n\t5. Avoid including 2 ideas in one statement unless cause-effect relationships are being measured.\n\t6. If opinion is being used, attribute it to some source unless the ability to identify opinion is being \n\tspecifically measured.\n\t7. True statements and false statements should be equal in length.\n\t8. The number of true and false statements should be approximately equal.\n2. Suggestions for constructing **matching exercises:**\n\t1. Use only homogeneous material in a single matching exercise.\n\t2. Include an unequal amount of responses and premises. Instruct examinees that responses maybe used once, more than once or not at all.\n\t3. Keep the list of items to match brief. Place the shorter responses on the right.\n\t4. Arrange the list of responses in logical order.\n\t5. Indicate the basis for matching the responses and premises.\n\t6. Place all of the items for one matching exercise on the same page.\n3. Suggestions for constructing **multiple-choice items**:\n\t1. The stem of the item should be meaningful by itself and should present a definite problem.\n\t2. The stem should include as much of the item as possible and should be free of irrelevant material.\n\t3. Use a negatively stated item stem only when significant learning outcomes require it.\n\t4. All of the alternatives should be grammatically consistent with the item stem.\n\t5. An item should contain only one correct or clearly best answer.\n\t6. All distracters should be plausible.\n\t7. Verbal association between the stem and the answer should be avoided.\n\t8. The relative length of the alternative should not provide a clue to the answer.\n\t9. Items used to measure understanding should contain some novelty but beware of too much \n\tnovelty.\n\t10. The correct/best answer should appear in each alternative position an approximately equal \n\tnumber of times but in random order.\n\t11. For single-word choices, order the questions alphabetically. For phrases and sentences, try to \n\tmake the length of the choices the same, and/or arrange them from shortest to longest. \n\t12. Use sparingly special alternatives such as ‚Äúnone of the above‚Äù or ‚Äúall of the above‚Äù.\n\t13. Do not use multiple-choice when other item types are more appropriate.\n\t14. Break any of these when you have a good reason for doing so.\n4. Suggestions for constructing **interpretive exercises:**\n\t1. Select introductory that is in harmony with the objectives of the course.\n\t2. Introductory should be appropriate to the curricular experience and reading ability of the examinees.\n\t3. Select introductory material that is new to examinees.\n\t4. Select introductory material that is brief and meaningful.\n\t5. Revise introductory material for clarity, conciseness and greater interpretive value.\n\t6. Construct test items that require analysis and interpretation of introductory material.\n\t7. Make the number of items roughly proportional to the length of the introductory material.\n\t8. Observe all suggestions for constructing objective test items.\n5. Suggestions for constructing **short response items**:\n\t1. Word the item so that the answer is both brief and definite.\n\t2. Do not take items directly from books to use as a basis for short answer items.\n\t3. A direct question is generally more acceptable than an incomplete statement.\n\t4. Indicate the type of answer wanted if the answer is to be expressed in numerical units.\n\t5. Blanks for answers should be equal in length.\n\t6. Do not use too many blanks.\n6. Suggestions for constructing **essay items**:\n\t1. Ask questions or tasks that will require the examinee to demonstrate a command of essential knowledge.\n\t2.

My schedule is dictated by training and performances, my expenses mostly go to classes and supplements, and my social circles are filled with teammates and coaches.  Because of this intense lifestyle, the art of dance feels very much like a sport to me; this is made true, considering that I have competed in various dance competitions and battles in the past. As a naturally hardworking person, I firmly believe that one's results or performance is determined by their own efforts; however, I must also acknowledge that many social factors made me into the athlete I am today ‚Äî particularly race, gender, and socioeconomic class. In this essay, I will be discussing the influence of these factors in a macro scale (how they work in a societal context) and a micro scale (how they have personally affected me).\n\nFirst, race. Filipinos are known as natural born performers. I see this in sheer amount of talent surrounding me. I would always see Filipino teams compete in international competitions like Hiphop International, World of Dance, and America's Got Talent; I would also hear often from my mother about the achievements of her relatives, such as winning ballroom dance competitions. The Filipinos' affinity for dance can also be seen in its localization; dance forms that originated from other countries have now been localized to the point that they have a distinct Filipino flavor. For instance, in classical dance, this is shown by the existence of the Philippine Classical Ballet syllabus and the Filipino Contemporary dance genre; these styles are then exhibited in company productions tackling local narratives (e.g. Ballet Manila's *Ibong Adarna*, Philippine Ballet Theatre's *Ibalon*, Alice Reyes Dance Philippines' *Encantada*). Because of this influence, I often learned dance styles through the lens of a local context (a.k.a. the \"Filipino\" way). If I were born in a different country, I don't think I would have had as much exposure to dance.\n\nNext, gender. While dance is an activity open to all gender identities, some styles are associated with certain connotations; classical genres like ballet are considered feminine, while urban ones like hip-hop are considered masculine. In line with this, the first styles my mom enrolled me in were heavily associated with female sensuality: jazz and belly dance. In all my years of dancing, I barely had any male classmates/teammates; even when I joined a street dance crew in high school, majority of my peers were female. Dance, along with other sports like gymnastics and figure skating, can also be seen as \"girly\" because of its emphasis on appearance. A dancer's performance is judged based on their leanness, shape, and movement, and going on a show often requires them getting into costume and make-up beforehand. As a result, many female dancers are prone to body image disorders. In my case, I used to overexercise and fast for long periods of time in the past because I was considered to be \"fat\" as a dancer. If I was born male, I probably would've started in hip-hop first (or other sports more \"masculine\" than dance); I also would've been less likely to practice unhealthy relationships with food and exercise.\n\nFinally, socioeconomic class. Dance is an expensive activity to invest in ‚Äî especially when it comes to classical dance forms like ballet. Classes, shoes, and costumes are already costly enough, but if a dancer plans to compete, the costs skyrocket; they must also consider paying for coaching, travel, competition entry fees, etc. While street dance is more accessible, costs for competing still inhibit dancers; during the summer (a.k.a. competition season), many hip-hop dancers had to do fundraisers just to be able to compete in America. Daily living also becomes more expensive in general; for example, in order to stay in tip-top shape, professional ballet dancers require weekly physical therapy appointments. In sum, the costs of pursuing dance make it a luxury that many can't afford. My family is considered upper middle class, so they were able to cover much of my dance-related expenses over the years. Their class also played a role in the dance styles I started in. I grew up in a pretty sheltered environment; for most of my life, I attended private Catholic schools and relied on private transport (I didn't learn how to fully commute until I was in college). In line with this, I think my mother was more comfortable with me learning dance in a polished studio than outside in the streets. If my family was less well-off, we wouldn't have been able to afford this choice. \n\nOverall, working on this essay made me ponder: if I was born in a different race, gender, or class, would I still be pursuing dance? No matter how passionate I am, this is hard to answer; the passion I have for dance may be innate, but I cannot deny that it was cultivated by my own circumstances. Thus, it honestly feels like the stars aligned for me just to pursue this sport. As an overcritical perfectionist, I have a bad habit of ruminating on what-ifs: \"What if I was studying dance in America?\"; \"What if I was a male dancer?\"; \"What if my parents could afford having me study abroad?\". But now, I'm truly grateful that my life has worked out the way it has.","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.735605378Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2023-09-12":{"title":"2023-09-12","content":"‚Äî-\ntitle: ‚Äú2023-09-12‚Äù\n‚Äî-\n## Practice Teaching\n#EDUC130_3 #education #teaching #learning \n### Instructional Strategies: Designing Learning Experiences\n#### Questions you can ask\n- As a neo-teacher, these questions can guide you in choosing the appropriate instructional strategies that you can employ:\n\t- Who are my students?¬† (Age, Gender, Personality, Learning Style, etc)\n\t- What is their context? (economic status, culture, etc)\n\t- What are some logistical set-up that I must consider? (wifi-bandwidth, classroom set-up, class size, class schedule, etc)\n\t- What type of \"Learning\" do I want to happen in class?¬† (Smith and Ragan, 2005)\n\t- What activities can I do with my students?¬† (William Horton, 2012)\n\t- What questions will I ask to deepen the learning that I want to happen?\n- Recent questions that I now ask is:\n\t- What is the modality of teaching?¬† Is it face to face?¬† Online?¬† Or blended?\n\t- What activities will engage my students?\n- As you stay longer in the field of teaching and begin gaining experience, you may ask additional questions like:\n\t- What worked the last time that is worth repeating?\n\t- What new strategies am I willing to try out?\n- In a way, preparing for a lesson is like cooking, let say, Rice.¬† \n\t- It depends on what type of rice ==(objective)== you want to make:¬† plain, Chinese Fried Rice, Maki, Gimbap, or Paella.¬† \n\t- Then you need to consider the taste of the people who will eat ==(students and their context)== and the ingredients that you have on hand ==(logistical set-up)== and how you will present this so that your customers will want to try it.¬† \n\t- For new teachers, you might want to try the easiest way of cooking rice and this is by using a rice cooker.¬† As you get better, then you can proceed to cooking fried rice, rice rolls onto paella.\n#### Gagne‚Äôs 9 Events of Instruction\nBefore delving into what teaching strategies we can use for our lessons in class, it might be good to look at what happens in class.¬† According to Robert Gagne, an American educational psychologist best know for his works on Conditions of Learning, there are 9 events that happen in a class.¬†¬†\n\n1. **Gain attention**:¬†Obtain students‚Äô attention so that they will watch and listen while the instructor presents the learning content.\n\t1. Present a story or a problem to be solved\n\t2. Utilize ice breaker activities, current news and events, case studies, YouTube videos, and so on. The objective is to quickly grab student attention and interest in the topic\n\t3. Utilize technologies such as clickers, and surveys to ask leading questions prior to lecture, survey opinion, or gain a response to a controversial question\n2. **Inform learner of objectives**: Allow students to organize their thoughts regarding what they are about to see, hear, and/or do.\n\t1. Include learning objectives in lecture slides, the syllabus, and in instructions for activities, projects and papers\n\t2. Describe required performance\n\t3. Describe criteria for standard performance\n3. **Stimulate recall of prior knowledge**:\n\t1. Help students make sense of new information by relating it to something they already know or something they have already experienced.\n\t2. Recall events from previous lecture, integrate results of activities into the current topic, and/or relate previous information to the current topic\n\t3. Ask students about their understanding of previous concepts\n4. **Present new content**: Utilise a variety of methods including lecture, readings, activities, projects, multimedia, and others.\n\t1. Sequence and chunk the information to avoid cognitive overload\n\t2. Blend the information to aid in information recall\n\t3. Bloom's Revised Taxonomy can be used to help sequence the lesson by helping you chunk them into levels of difficulty\n5. **Provide guidance**: Advise students of strategies to aid them in learning content and of resources available. With learning guidance, the rate of learning increases because students are less likely to lose time or become frustrated by basing performance on incorrect facts or poorly understood concepts.\n\t1. Provide instructional support as needed ‚Äì as scaffolds (cues, hints, prompts) which can be removed after the student learns the task or content\n\t2. Model varied learning strategies ‚Äì mnemonics, concept mapping, role playing, visualizing\n\t3. Use examples and non-examples\n6. **Practice**: Allow students to apply knowledge and skills learned.\n\t1. Allow students to apply knowledge in group or individual activities\n\t2. Ask deep-learning questions, make reference to what students already know or have students collaborate with their peers\n\t3. Ask students to recite, revisit, or reiterate information they have learned\n\t4. Facilitate student elaborations ‚Äì ask students to elaborate or explain details and provide more complexity to their responses\n7. **Provide feedback**: Provide immediate feedback of students‚Äô performance to assess and facilitate learning.\n\t1. Consider using group / class level feedback (highlighting common errors, give examples or models of target performance, show students what you do not want)\n\t2. Consider implementing peer feedback\n\t3. Require students to specify how they used feedback in subsequent works\n8. **Assess performance**: To evaluate the effectiveness of the instructional events, test to see if the expected learning outcomes have been achieved. Performance should be based on previously stated objectives.\n\t1. Utilize a variety of assessment methods including exams/quizzes, written assignments, projects, and so on\n9. **Enhance retention and transfer**: Allow students to apply information to personal contexts. This increases retention by personalising information.\n\t1. Provide opportunities for students to relate course work to their personal experiences\n\t2. Provide additional practice\n\n#### Smith and Ragan - Types of Learning\nSmith and Ragan (2005) shared with us 9 Types of Learning that happen in class and suggests instructional strategies that goes with each.¬† Let's take time out and consider them.\n1.¬†¬†**Declarative Knowledge** is also known as verbal information and has three kinds: labels/names, facts/list, and organized discourse.¬† Some instructional strategies we can use to enhance this type of learning are:¬† using mnemonic techniques, establishing connections, and practicing.\n2.  **Concept Learning**¬†involves the ability to apply knowledge across a variety of instances or circumstances.¬† Some instructional strategies include explaining, giving examples, and practicing skills of generalizing.\n3. **Learning Procedures**¬†includes the step by step knowledge before arriving at an answer or a solution.¬† This can include executing of a particular psychomotor skill like dribbling a basketball or arriving at a solution for a math problem.¬† Strategies given here are practice and giving feedbacks.\n4. **Principle Learning**¬†prescribes relationships which are often described in the form of If....then or cause...effect.¬† Some learning strategies suggested here are reflection, hands on practice, examples from prior experiences.\n5. **Problem Solving**¬†is the ability to combine previously learned principles, declarative knowledge, procedures and cognitive strategies in a unique way to solve a previously unencountered problem.¬† ¬†Strategies suggested here are:¬† forming well-defined and clear problems, alternate ways of presenting the problem, tapping on relevant prior knowledge, providing of mental or visual aids.\n6. **Cognitive Strategies**¬†are techniques that learners use to control and monitor their won cognitive processes.¬† These are mental tactics for attending to: organizing, elaborating, manipulating, and retrieving knowledge which lead to discovery, invention, and creativity.¬† Divergent thinking strategies like employing various solutions option to deal with the problem, selfrategies -instructional training, or direct instructions may be used.\n7. **Attitude Learning**¬† is not often explicitated in the LOs.¬† There are instances though that we want to form or change attitudes such as:¬† LBGT acceptance, valuing Catholic traditions and practices and the like.¬† Instructional strategies like self-reflection, observation, input and role modeling can be practiced.\n8. **Psychomotor Skill Learning**¬†is characterized by coordinated muscular movements.¬† This learning is often complemented by Procedural learning and instructional strategies like practicing, watching tutorial videos, and feedback giving are often used.\n9. **Integration of Types of Learning** includes combination of 2 or more types of learning. Strategies include collaborative learning, drawing from previous knowledge among others.\n\n#### Absorb-Do-Connect Activities\n- Here are more ideas for activities¬†that can be used and implemented in the class.¬† ¬†Taken from William Horton's E-Learning by Design, we can choose activities that suit the needs of our learners.\n- According to Horton, there are 3 categories of activities:¬† Absorb-Do-Connect.¬† Each category serves a specific purpose depending on what the teacher wants the learners to achieve at the end of the class/module.\n\n#### Discovering Instructional Strategies\n- There are tons of resources and literature written on Instructional Strategy.¬†¬†Here are two resources which you can view to give you more ideas.\n\t- [Marzano's High Yield Instructional Strategies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lQFbu8h8k4\u0026t=419s)¬† ¬†¬†- Robert Marzano is a well known American Educational Researcher.¬† He has done massive work on Assessment¬†and Instructional Strategies.¬† View this video to get a general idea of his work.\n\t- [32 Research-Based Instructional Strategies for Teachers](https://www.teachthought.com/pedagogy/32-research-based-instructional-strategies/)¬† ¬† -¬†a quick reference page on strategies that teachers can easily use.¬† I encourage you to click on the related resources given on each of the strategy.\n\n![[Absorb-Do-Connect.png]]\n\n![[9 Events of Instruction.png]]","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.735605378Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2023-09-15":{"title":"2023-09-15","content":"‚Äî-\ntitle: ‚Äú2023-09-15‚Äù\n‚Äî-\n## SocSci 14\n### Module 3 The State\n#### What is a state?\n-  A State is defined as a community of persons more or less numerous, permanently occupying a definite portion of territory, independent of external control, and possessing an organized government to which the great body of its inhabitants render habitual obedience.\n- A state is a corporate group that has continuous organization, exercises compulsory jurisdiction, and claims a monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force within a given territory and its population. - Max Weber\n\n##### Elements of the State\nFor a state to exist, it needs to have the 4 essential elements:\n- **People:** this refers to the large number of ==inhabitants== living within the state\n- **Territory:** this includes not only the ==land== over which the state exercises control, but also the ==river and lakes== therein, certain ==area of the sea== which borders on its coasts and the ==air space== above them\n- **Government:** this refers to the ==agency== through which the will of the state is formulated, expressed, and carried out \n- **Sovereignty:** this is the ==power of the state to command and enforce obedience== from the people. It is the independence devoid of any direct external control\n\n##### Inherent Powers of the State\nThe State exercises certain inherent powers over its people:\n- **Police Power:** the power of the state ==to enact and enforce laws and to regulate property and liberty== in the promotion of the general welfare of the people\n- **Power of Eminent Domain:** this power enables the states ==to take property for public use== upon payment of just compensation\n- **Power of Taxation:** the power of the state ==to impose and collect revenues== for the operations of the government\n\n#### Exercise of Power\nContemporary states are expected to practice its powers and sustain its attributes via specific institutional innovations and/or practices.\n- First, it ==defines and limits its territory== vis-a-vis other states and societies, in order to preserve its integrity and avoid conflict.\n- Second, it ==seeks to control and limit elements within its territory and population== by which force and violence may be committed, be it in the form of regulating access to weapons or disciplining social behavior.\n- Third, most modern states also prefer to ==publish impersonal structures of power and governance== in order not only to limit potential tendencies to concentrate power on an individual or a set of people, but also to make the business of running it more inclusive.\nThese practices are expected to grant the state legitimacy in its continued existence, and the validity of its actions.\n\n#### Nation or State?\nMost modern states are usually labelled nation-states. Yet an important distinction must be made between the two. We can make this distinction in practice:\n- A **state** is a ==*legal concept/body*== in which the elements of a state discussed as above concur\n- A **nation**, on the other hand, is an *ethnic concept* in which the people are bound together by a common history and culture\n\n##### What makes up a Nation?\n- **Benedict Anderson** (2016, c1991) provides a classic definition of both a nation as ‚Äú**an imagined political community** ‚Äî and imagined both inherently limited and sovereign‚Äù (p. 6).\n- Anderson elucidates that the nation is **imagined** in the sense that ‚Äúthe members of even the smallest nation will never know most of their fellow-members, meet them, or even hear of them, yet in the minds of each lives the image of their communion‚Äù (p. 6).\n- Anderson adds that this imagination is **limited** since ‚Äú[n]o nation imagines itself coterminous with manking‚Äù, that is, there are markers differentiating one national identity from another (p. 7).\n- The nation is also imagined as **sovereign** as ‚Äúnations dream of being free, and, if under God, directly so‚Äù with the ‚Äúgage and embiem of this freedom [being] the sovereign state‚Äù.\n- Lastly Anderson emphasizes that the nation is imagined as a *community*, because, regardless of the actual inequality and exploitation that may prevail in each, the nation is always conceived as a deep, horizontal comradeship. Ultimately it is this fraternity that makes it possible, over the past two centuries, for so many millions of people, not so much to kill, as willingly to die for such limited imaginings (p. 7, emphasis in original).\n- The presence of a **national identity** thus usually serves as the backbone of a state‚Äôs claim to legitimacy, in that it represents and embodies the totality of the territory, population, and history present within its control. Yet this is not without complication in practice. There are some groups of people whose nations may not be a state or sovereignty. Some states, in turn, can be made up of various groups or nations.","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.735605378Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2023-09-19":{"title":"\"2023-09-19\"","content":"## Practice Teaching\n#EDUC130_3 #education #teaching \n### When are you most engaged?\nWhen I think of engagement, there is this concept that comes to mind to me called **flow**. Psychologist Mihalyi Csikszentmihalyi defines this as \"a state in which people are so involved in an activity that nothing else seems to matter; the experience is so enjoyable that people will continue to do it even at great cost, for the sheer sake of doing it\".  He says it can be accessed in the sweet spot between boredom and anxiety, as displayed by the chart below. To induce flow, an activity shouldn't be too easy to the point that the student is bored, nor too hard to the point it makes the student anxious.\n\n![[Extras/Media/Images/Flow State Chart.png]]\n\nIn my case, I feel most engaged whenever I'm learning physically challenging skills. One of my hobbies is going to adult gymnastics classes, where I've been working on skills such as walkovers and aerials. I definitely don't get bored during these classes because of how challenging they are. Thankfully, they're not too difficult for my skill level thanks to coaches who make sure to provide accessible progressions. These progressions make skills seem more doable.\n### Engagement Defined\n![[Extras/Media/Images/Student Engagement.png]]\n\nAccording to Nkomo, Daniel \u0026 Butson (2021) student engagement consists of three dimensions:\n- _**Behavioral:**¬†Participation, effort and persistence in activities_\n- _**Cognitive:**¬†The psychological investments made by the learner in the activities_\n- _**Emotional:**¬†The emotional reactions in learning or towards the activities or experiences_\n\n### Fostering **Cognitive Engagement**: The ICAP Hypothesis\n- Michelene T. H. Chi \u0026 Ruth Wylie¬†(2014) proposed the [[Cards/ICAP hypothesis]]. \n\t- It predicts that ==as students become more engaged with the learning materials, from¬†_passive_¬†to¬†_active_¬†to¬†_constructive_¬†to¬†_interactive_, their learning will increase. ==\n\t- What does ICAP mean? ICAP stands for ==Interactive, Constructive, Active and Passive.== \n\t- The descriptions for each classification of activity are shown below along with some examples.\n![[Extras/Media/Images/ICAP Taxonomy.png]]\n- Essentially, the hypothesis states that while learning is invisible, ==we, as teachers, can observe this, in terms how students are able to do. ==\n\t- The hypothesis also assumes that ==cognitive engagement increases as we go from P to I.==\n![[Extras/Media/Images/ICAP Framework.png]]\n\n### Promoting **Affective Engagement**\n**How do we promote affective engagement?** We can promote affective engagement by primarily making connections to self and others. We can do this by:\n1. **Promoting a sense of community.**¬†Provide opportunities to collaborate and connect with each other, use icebreakers to build rapport.\n2. **Provide timely feedback and use student work as exemplars.**¬†The ==TAG feedback== is a good way for students to give feedback to their classmates.\n\t1. ![[Extras/Media/Images/TAG Feedback.png]]\n3. **Connect to content and encourage self-reflection.**¬†An example of this is a framework called ==What, So, What, Now, What.== The teacher can have discussion on the event, idea or concept, connect with theory and knowledge, and ask students how this can be applied towards some action.\n\t1. ![[Extras/Media/Images/3 Whats Framework.png]]\n\n### Fostering Behavioral Engagement\n- We can foster behavioral engagement by ==providing opportunities for participation through universal response.== \n\t- Fisher, Fray, Bustamante \u0026 Hattie (2021) recommend formatively assessing students using Universal Response via Hand Signals, Response Cards and Polling such as the one below:\n![[Extras/Media/Images/Hand Signals.png]]\n- To make participation more fun, you may also ==use response cards, or even polling.== Give a prompt and ask students to respond, through online polling or response cards. This way, you generate more responses from students, and at the same time, you also get to see if students are on track based on their responses.\n\n### Why universal response?\nAccording to Fisher, Frey, Bustaments \u0026 Hattie (2021):\n- Universal responses offer ways for learners to engage students in the ==cognitive practices of rehearsal and retrieval.==\n- Frequent universal responses promote active learning and give insight into ==what is sticking== instructional and what isn't.\n- Non verbal responses, polling and waterfall chats ensure feedback opportunities are ==extended to the entire class, not only individuals.==\n\n### The Engagement Matrix\n- _So if I keep asking difficult questions, will that ensure students are engaged? If I keep implementing group activities, does that mean students are engaged? If I keep implementing universal response techniques, will that keep them engaged?_\n\t- **The answer is...it depends. Because it begins with your intention.**\n- Stull \u0026 Mayer (2007) proposed an Engagement Matrix involving looking at the activities we implement in class in terms of¬† ==psychological activity== and ==behavioral activity.==\n\t- For example, an easy class quiz could generate high behavioral activity but low in psychological activity. \n\t- A lecture could be considered as one involving low behavioral and psychological activity but inserting a challenging discussion prompt within the lecture could raise the psychological activity. \n- So when planning what questions to ask, and what activities to implement, it helps to ask:\n\t1. What is your¬†**purpose**¬†for asking the question?¬†\n\t\t1. Review, Summarizing; \n\t\t2. Deepening understanding; (Cognitive)¬†\n\t\t3. Sharing Experiences \u0026 Opinions (Affective)\n\t2. What¬†**conten**t is included in the question?¬†\n\t\t1. Prior knowledge\n\t\t2. Prior experience\n\t\t3. New knowledge learned\n\t3. **How**¬†should you generate responses?\n\t\t1. Behavioral: Universal response strategies, Cold call, collaborative tools\n![[Extras/Media/Images/The Engagement Matrix.png]]\n\n### Using [[Cards/ACE Thought-Weaving Framework|ACE Thought-Weaving Framework]] TO Engage\n- **How can ACE guide us to facilitate cognitive engagement?**\n\t- ACE stands for¬†Activating from Context, Connect to Content and Evaluate to Validate. We can use this acronym to help us identify questions we can ask.\n- **Activate from Context**\n\t- Ask a question, give a prompt that helps surface anything related to the topic at hand\n\t- E.G. Prior knowledge, Prior experience, Their current situation\n- **Connect to Content**\n\t- Use interesting age-appropriate examples\n\t- Use metaphors\n\t- Use interesting situations\n- **Evaluate to Validate**\n\t- Provide opportunities for practice and application.¬†\n\t- Provide feedback to help students realize what has changed through their learning experiences.\n\n### Summary\n- **We defined engagement as having three dimensions - affective, behavioral and cognitive.**\n- We can promote cognitive engagement by asking questions that activate from context, connect to content and evaluate to validate.\n- We can promote affective engagement by ensuring that the skills and content are connected to self and others. We can foster behavioral engagement through Universal Response.|\n","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.735605378Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2023-09-26":{"title":"2023-09-26","content":"‚Äî-\ntitle: ‚Äú2023-09-26‚Äù\n‚Äî-\n## SocSci 14\n#politics \n### Democracy\n- **Democracy** is a system that is meant to capture and consolidate the multifacetedness and multivocality of societies in order to help these societies attain common goals.\n- 3 types of definitions:\n\t-  **Proceduralist:** emphasize the *formal* institutions and mechanisms of democracy. These scholars generally argue that societies can be identified and studied as democratic as long as these have procedures and processes that guarantee certain political outcomes.\n\t\t- For Schumpeter, democracy is ‚Äúthat institutional arrangement for arriving at a political decision in which individuals acquire power to decide by means of a competitive struggle for the people‚Äôs vote‚Äù.\n\t\t- Meanwhile, Huntington asserts that elections are ‚Äúthe central procedure of democracy‚Äù and that a political system is democratic to the extent that its ‚Äúmost powerful collective decision makers are selected through fair, honest, and periodic elections in which candidates freely compete for votes and which virtually all the adult population is eligible to vote,‚Äù\n\t- **Middle-range:** combines the proceduralist definition and with other institutions, mostly human rights, as fundamental to democracy.\n\t\t- Georg Sorensen, for example, succinctly defines the middle-range approach to defining democracy as ‚Äúcompetition, participation, and civil and political liberties‚Äù.\n\t\t- This definition would look like what Robert Dahl identifies as a ‚Äúpolitical democracy‚Äù. **Political democracy** ensures that there are ‚Äúunimpaired opportunities‚Äù for people to formulate and enact their preferences through individual and collective action.\n\t- **Long-range** definitions define democracy more broadly by adding more normative and substantive notions of political society to the definition\n\t\t- David Held, for instance,  argues that a democratic model of state and society should have ‚Äúdemocratic autonomy‚Äù or ‚Äúliberal socialism‚Äù\n- Laclau and Mouffe‚Äôs definition of democracy can be called radical as the principle of democratization usually found in institutions and formal processes are extended even to the everyday interactions of citizens (recall [[Productive power]] in Barnett and Duvall)\n- This definition is also ‚Äúplural‚Äù in the sense that Laclau and Mouffe eschew the usual Marxist solution of armed struggle and revolution leading to the violent overthrow of the state as the end-all solution to the problem of class struggle\n- For Laclau and Mouffe, the multiplicity of problems arising from contemporary late capitalism means that the solution to these problems must also be open to **‚Äúthe principle that individuals should have the possibility to organize their lives as they wish, to choose their own ends, and to *realize* them as they think best.‚Äù\n- Quimpo also makes use of Huber, Rueschemeyer, and Stephen‚Äôs view that there are essentially three types of democracy namely: **formal, participatory, and social.**\n\t- **Formal Democracy** -\u003e combines four features:\n\t\t- Regular and free elections\n\t\t- Universal suffrage\n\t\t- Accountability of the state‚Äôs administrative organs to the elected representatives\n\t\t- And effective guarantees for freedom of expression as well as protection from arbitrary state action\n\t- These formal democracies can also grow into **participatory democracies** where all of these elements are present with high levels of participation from the people across social categories such as class, race, and gender.\n\t- Finally, the last type of democracy is **social democracy**, where this democratization is also extended so as to ensure equity not just in political processes, but also in the social and economic outcomes of society.\n- Quimpo hopes that these combined frameworks will lead to what Juan Linz describes as a **‚Äúconsolidated democracy‚Äù:** one where ‚Äúnone of the major political actors, parties, or organized interests, forces, or institutions consider that there is any alternative to democratic processes to gain power, and that no political institution or group has a claim to veto the action of democratically elected decision-makers‚Äù. In other words, **democracy is recognized as the non-negotiable backdrop and system for politics, the economy, and society.**\n- **Patron-Client Interpretation:** long regarded as the most influential interpretation of Philippine politics. In this view, Philippine politics is about personal relations and networks linked by kinship, friendship, exchange of favors, influence, and money.\n\t- The resources of the state are seen as spoils for the victor, who then, by virtue of their office or power, are free to spend or spread these spoils around to their preferred clients which can take the form of either their family members, political and business allies, voters, and supporters.","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.735605378Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2023-09-27":{"title":"2023-09-27","content":"‚Äî-\ntitle: ‚Äú2023-09-27‚Äù\n‚Äî-\n## Practice Teaching\n#EDUC130_3 #education #teaching \n### Strategies to Engage Learners\n-  Participate in warmups (e.g. kamustahans, prayers): Can be interactive\n- Summarize your learnings at the end of class: Constructive\n- Discuss with groupmates/classmates: Interactive\n- Write down notes from lecture: Active?

What makes this difficult is that some of the changes, for Leftwich, are ==inevitably *\"non-consensual\"*==\n- This happens in societies where \"a new developmentally committed regime comes to power facing a legacy of immense inequality in wealth and opportunity which requires urgent attention\".\n- For example, \"==institutional arrangements to encourage and manage the process ==(in relation to savings, taxation, and especially investment), are institutions that need to be examined and reformed if development is to occur.\"\n- Changes such as these are made with a rapidity and thoroughness that might upset the balance of power in localities and spaces with deeply-entrenched groups and interests\n\t- Reforms on these key areas of the economic structure of a society must be far-reaching. In exchange, the successful development of the economic institutions of a society may lead to the transformation of a more egalitarian distribution of wealth and power\n- Development programs need to be i==mplemented continuously== to be successful\n\t- In a democratic country, it needs to be ensured that despite the changing of the leadership/administration, these development programs will be continuously implemented to ensure its maximum effect and maximum benefit\n\n##### Back to Development and Democracy\n- Therein lies the \"friction\" between democracy and development. Informal democratic institutions, for example, are fundamentally ==mechanisms filled with uncertainty==\n- Elections mean that across a short period of time (let's say 3 years to 6 years), the prospect that the entire personal setup of your political system will change *whether the old players like it or not* is directly inimical to developmental desires for stability\n- ==Stability is important in modelling economic development==, for example, as economic policies and actions can be planned out in advance\n\t- Political currents, however, given the nature of politics and democracy, does not allow for such planning\n\t- This is why, for example, that even as PH presidents change, ==their economic policies do not really change over time.== It is an attempt by our leaders to mitigate the \"disruptive\" uncertain character of our political system in order to encourage economic growth\n- *\"While development requires institutions that promote more or less radical accumulation, change, or transformation, the institutions which are required to sustain and consolidate democracy are characteristically the ones that promote the politics of accommodation, compromise, and the centre. The political logic of democracy is generally, therefore, necessarily consensual, conservative, and incremental in the change that it brings about\"* (Leftwich 2005, 699)\n\n#### Development and Freedom\n- *\"What should come first -- removing poverty and misery, or guaranteeing politcal liberty and civil rights, for which poor people have little use anyway?\"* (Sen, 1999)\n- Sen believed that the way the question is presented is misleading. *It is presented in such a way where one can be achieved without the other.* Or in other words, that ==democracy is an impediment to economic development.==\n- He however believes that the real issue is the *\"interconnections between political freedoms and the understanding and fulfillment of economic needs\"*\n- In particular, he notes that democracy has an **instrumental and constructive** aspect for economic development.\n- To wit, he says that **democratic institutions** are \"not only instrumental (*political freedoms can have a major role in providing incentives and information in the solution of acute economic needs*), but also constructive. Our conceptualization of economic needs ==depends crucially on open public debates and discussions==, the guaranteeing which requires insistence on basic political liberty and civil rights.\"\n- He then argues that there are three major considerations in arguing that ==democracy \"adds to -- rather than subtracts from -- the urgency of political freedoms\".== These three considerations are, to quote Sen:\n\t- Their direct importance in human living associated with basic capabilities (including that of political and social participation);\n\t- Their instrumental role in enhancing the hearing that people get in expressing and supporting their claims to political attention (including the claims of economic needs);\n\t- Their constructive role in the conceptualization of \"needs\" (including the understanding of \"economic needs\" in a social context)\n\n##### Popular Claims on Development vs Democracy \n1. **First Claim:** [[Cards/The Lee Thesis]]. Named after the late Lee Kuan Yew, the former Prime Minister of the Republic of Singapore. This is the popular belief that ==freedoms and rights hamper economic growth and development.==\n2. **Second Claim:** Quoting Sen: \"it has been argued that if poor people are given the choice between having political freedoms and fulfilling economic needs, ==they will invariably choose the latter.== Since people have reason to want to eliminate, first and foremost, economic deprivation and misery, they have reason enough for not insisting on political freedoms, which would get in the way of their real priorities.\"\n3. **Third Claim:** It has often been argued that the emphasis on political freedom, liberties, and democracy is a specifically \"Western\" priority, which goes, in particular, against \"Asian values\", which are supposed to be more keen on order and discipline then on liberty and freedom\n##### Sen's Counterclaims\n1. **Counterclaim:** For Sen, there is actually very little evidence that [[Cards/The Lee Thesis|The Lee Thesis]] is true. In fact, studies even note that the effect of democratization on economic development is minor, if it exists at all. There are studies that do indicate a strong relation between greater democratization and greater economic development. To quote Sen: ==\"Systemic empirical studies give no real support to the claim that there is a general conflict between political freedoms and economic performance.\"==\n2. Sen then surmises that ==there can be general policies that deepen democratization as well as encourage economic growth and development. ==These include: \"openness to competition, the use of international markets, a high level of literacy and school education, successful land reforms and pubic provision of incentives for investment, exporting, and industrialization.\"\n3. **Counterclaim:** Quite simply, Sen explains that given the first claim ([[Cards/The Lee Thesis|The Lee Thesis]]) does not have any empirical support, so does this argument, given that this second claim is \"parasitic upon the first thesis\".\n4. **Sen's Counterclaim:** Civil and political rights enable peoples to demand that their governments respond to their needs as citizens. As such, for Sen, ==\"the exercise of political rights (voting, criticizing, protesting, etc.) can make a real difference\"==\n\n##### Related to Development vs Democracy \nSen also emphasizes the instrumental and preeminent role of political freedoms in addressing economic needs. This is through:\n- Their **direct importance** in human living associated with basic capabilities (including that of political and social participation);\n- Their **instrumental role** in enhancing the hearing that people get in expressing and supporting their claims to political attention (including the claims of economic needs); \n- Their **constructive role** in the conceptualization of 'needs' (including the understanding of 'economic needs' in a social context)\n\n- As such, there should be ==no divergence between democracy and development==, since they can mutually constitute, and enable each other.\n- Democracy ==creates sets of opportunities that empower people== to demand for development and to participate in social processes, including the process of development itself.\n\n\"Democracy does not serve as an automatic remedy of ailments as quinine works to remedy malaria. The opportunity it opens up has to be positively grabbed in order to achieve the desired effect. This is, of course, a basic feature of freedoms in general -- much depends on how freedoms are actually exercised.\" (Sen, 1999)","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.735605378Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2023-10-10":{"title":"2023-10-10","content":"‚Äî-\ntitle: ‚Äú2023-10-10‚Äù\n‚Äî-\n## SocSci 14\n#politics \n### Understanding Governance\n#### What is governance?\n- Governance is defined as **‚Äúthe exercise of political, economic, and administrative authority to manage a nation‚Äôs affairs.‚Äù** (UNDP, 1997)\n- Governance does not only involve government affairs, it also welcomes the participation of the private sector and the civil society.\n\t- This engagement aims to achieve maximum participation from all the members of society to push for national development.\n- It involves a system where people‚Äôs freedom to express their interests, exercise their rights, and resolve their differences are institutionalized for the benefit of many. (Asian Development Bank, 1995)\n- Basic elements of governance:\n\t- **Accountability**: Public officials need to answer to the citizenry. Their actions and functions must be for the welfare and interest of the people.\n\t- **Participation**: People should have access to and involvement in policy and decision making.\n\t- **Predictability**: Laws, regulations, and policies should be equally applied to all and is not open to different interpretations.\n\t- **Transparency:** Public information should be accessible and available to the people.\n#### Four types of governance\n- **Economic governance:** includes the processes of decision making that directly or indirectly affect a country‚Äôs economic activities or its relationships with other economies\n- **Political governance:** refers to decision-making and policy implementation of a legitimate and authoritative state\n- **Administrative governance:** a system of policy implementation carried out through an efficient, independent, accountable, and open public sector\n- **Systemic governance:** encompasses the processes and structure of social systems for better life of the people\n#### Characteristics of good governance\n- Participatory\n- Sustainable\n- Legitimate and acceptable to the people\n- Transparent\n- Promotes equity and equality\n- Able to develop the resources and methods of governance\n- Promotes gender balance\n- Tolerates and accepts diverse perspectives\n- Able to mobilize resources for social purposes\n- Strengthens indigenous

Good governance as such takes on a crucial role as it gives economic development a much needed **political** direction.\n- Without good governance, economic development will always be exclusively geared towards more economic growth, rendering the other aspects necessary for human flourishing, such as health, equality, care for the environment, and human rights to fall by the wayside\n- Good

Excluding \"others\" is correlative to this sense of belonging. Certain profiles (age, gender, ethnicity etc.) often characterize those who belong or are excluded.

This insight struck me because it reminded me of the integral role culture plays in street dance, one of the main sports that I'm personally involved in. Styles in street dance are not just styles, but cultures; however, this tends to be forgotten in competitive settings, leaving these dance styles to be watered down into movements without context. In this report, I'll discuss the history behind street dance, and why it is the responsibility of dancers, as artist-athletes, to honor this.\n\nMost street dance styles were pioneered by dancers from minority groups, which may be defined by social factors such as race, gender, and socioeconomic class. For instance, hip-hop emerged in Black communities living in the Bronx, where people turned to dance for emotional release  ‚Äì a positive alternative to the drugs and violence that took over the neighborhood due to segregation's longstanding effects. This can also be seen in krump, which was created in downtown Los Angeles by young people as an alternative to violent street gang participation. Another example is waacking, which started in the gay clubs of Los Angeles; poor Black, Latino, and Asian men found the freedom to express themselves in these clubs, in spite of the oppressive environments they dealt with in their everyday lives. What we can take away from all these origin stories is that those who were excluded created a space where they could belong ‚Äì and this was done through dance. \n\nNow, street dance is more popular than ever. These styles have grown from being rooted in their respective communities to becoming global phenomena. Learning street dance is more accessible too; instead of going to streets or clubs, people can learn these styles through dance studios and online videos. However, the downside of this popularity is cultural appropriation: these styles are often used by others without acknowledging the people behind them. A prime example of this is the isolation of movements from their respective cultures. I first learned street dance styles like waacking in my high school's dance crew. My teammates and I would learn certain movements, which would then be put into choreographies for dance competitions. When I look back, I can definitely remember being taught these styles ‚Äì but not so much the history behind them. Cultural appropriation can also be seen in clothing. Past elements of my dance crew's costumes include cornrows and Dashikis ‚Äì which are distinctly from Black culture. Back then, I didn't know how harmful it was to be trying to look this way, even if I wasn't Black myself (which goes to show how normalized it was at the time). In general, what I've noticed is that in competitive settings, the history and meaning of street dance is stripped away in favor of flashiness and aesthetics.\n\nCultural appropriation is harmful because it disrespects the people behind these cultures ‚Äì and these people often tend to be marginalized. These styles were created by dancers dealing with systems of oppression, and these uncomfortable origins cannot remain unacknowledged. Renowned Hip Hop instructor and activist Soul Zuberi explains the profound impact of appropriation: \"...People have died over the things that you‚Äôre taking. People have lost their jobs, been treated like social pariahs, and spent hours laboring over learning these moves in secret. How can you then do those same moves without demonstrating respect to that struggle? You can‚Äôt trivialize the experience\". Some may argue that working to minimize cultural appropriation creates gated cultures that only certain groups can participate in (e.g. \"Only queer people can waack\"), but this is not the case. Minimizing cultural appropriation breaks down barriers between dominant cultures and minority cultures, ensuring that everyone receives respect and appreciation for their authentic work.\n\nThus, I believe that dancers, as artist-athletes, need to get educated in street dance culture if they are to compete. In a competition, every dancer involved has the responsibility of representing their style/s authentically. The best way to get educated would be through immersion. Streets and clubs are the classrooms with the most context, so dancers would best be able to learn about culture in these settings. \n\n\n- history...many dance styles came from minority groups\n\t- Hiphop has deep historical and social roots in African American culture, having emerged in Black communities living in 1970s New York.\n\t\t- Hip Hop first exploded in the Bronx where young Black dancers used their movement as a form of emotional release ‚Äì a positive alternative to the drugs and violence that gripped their neighborhood due to the longstanding effects of segregation.\n\t- Whacking found its start in the 1970s gay clubs of Los Angeles where high-energy funk and disco music dominated the airwaves.

It was created by a group of young people in South Central, Los Angeles, California as an alternative to violent street gang participation. Embedded in a community rife with gang culture, these at-risk young people modelled the organisational structure of krump after the street gang.\n- cultural appropriation\n\t- Working to minimize cultural appropriation is not about creating gated cultures that only certain people can participate in ‚Äì it‚Äôs the opposite. You‚Äôre breaking down the barriers between dominant cultures and minority cultures, so that¬†_everyone_¬†receives respect and appreciation for their authentic work.\n- Conclusion: dancers, as artist-athletes, need to get immersed in the culture in order to compete\n\n###### ChatGPT\nOne enlightening insight that I've come across pertains to the concept of communities in sports: the sense of belonging and identity inherently involves forms of exclusion, and this exclusion is intrinsically linked to the idea of belonging itself. This realization struck me as particularly poignant because it drew parallels with the integral role that culture plays in street dance, a sport that holds significant personal meaning for me. Street dance styles, I've come to realize, are not merely sets of movements; they represent cultures. Unfortunately, this crucial cultural dimension often gets overlooked in competitive settings, resulting in these dance styles being reduced to mere physical movements devoid of their rich cultural context. In this essay, I will delve into the history of street dance and argue why it is incumbent upon dancers, who I consider artist-athletes, to preserve and honor this cultural heritage.\n\nMost street dance styles trace their origins to pioneering dancers from marginalized groups, defined by factors such as race, gender, and socioeconomic status. For example, hip-hop emerged in the Black communities of the Bronx as a means of emotional release‚Äîa positive alternative to the drugs and violence that plagued the neighborhood due to the enduring effects of segregation. Similarly, krump was birthed in downtown Los Angeles as a response to the lure of violent street gang involvement among young people. Another example is waacking, which found its roots in the gay clubs of Los Angeles, where individuals from poor Black, Latino, and Asian backgrounds sought refuge to express themselves in spite of the oppressive circumstances they faced daily. A common thread running through all these origin stories is that individuals who were excluded from mainstream society created spaces where they could truly belong, and they achieved this through dance.\n\nToday, street dance has achieved unprecedented popularity, evolving from localized art forms into global phenomena. The accessibility of learning street dance has also increased, with dance studios and online videos replacing the necessity of learning on the streets or in clubs. However, this surge in popularity has given rise to a troubling phenomenon: cultural appropriation. Frequently, these styles are adopted and practiced by individuals without due acknowledgment of their cultural origins. One glaring manifestation of this issue is the separation of movements from their cultural contexts. In my personal experience, I learned street dance styles like waacking as a member of my high school's dance crew. My teammates and I would master specific movements, which would then be incorporated into choreographies for dance competitions. Reflecting back, I can vividly recall being taught these styles, but I can't say the same for the history and cultural significance behind them. The problem of cultural appropriation also extends to clothing choices, exemplified by my dance crew's costumes that once featured elements like cornrows and Dashikis‚Äîdistinctly emblematic of Black culture. At that time, I lacked awareness of the harm in trying to emulate this appearance, even though I wasn't Black myself, highlighting how normalized such behavior was in our dance community. In essence, competitive settings often prioritize superficiality and aesthetics over the profound history and meaning of street dance.\n\nCultural appropriation is deeply detrimental as it displays a lack of respect for the people and communities that gave birth to these cultures‚Äîcommunities that are often marginalized themselves. These dance styles were created by individuals who grappled with oppressive systems, and it is imperative not to ignore the discomforting origins of these art forms. Renowned Hip Hop instructor and activist Soul Zuberi eloquently emphasizes the gravity of cultural appropriation, stating, \"People have lost their jobs, been treated like social pariahs, and spent hours laboring over learning these moves in secret. How can you then do those same moves without demonstrating respect to that struggle? You can‚Äôt trivialize the experience.\" Some might argue that efforts to curtail cultural appropriation create exclusive cultural enclaves, suggesting, for instance, that only specific groups should practice waacking. However, this argument misses the mark. The objective of minimizing cultural appropriation is not to create barriers but to foster mutual respect and appreciation between dominant and minority cultures, ensuring that everyone is duly recognized for their authentic contributions.\n\nConsequently, I firmly believe that dancers, as artist-athletes, must educate themselves about street dance culture if they aspire to compete authentically. In a competition setting, every dancer bears the responsibility of representing their respective style in its truest form. Immersion is arguably the most effective means of gaining this education. Streets and clubs serve as classrooms where cultural context is most palpable, and dancers are best equipped to learn about these cultures in these genuine settings. By getting educated this way, dancers can fully honor the origins and significance of these styles on the competitive stage.","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.735605378Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2023-11-07":{"title":"\"2023-11-07\"","content":"## Practice Teaching\n### MIL Demo\n#### Research Dump\n- Algorithms\n- [[Cards/The Dragonfly Effect]]\n#### Outline\n1.

I was barely able to experience winning, much less competing ‚Äî in fact, more often than not, I didn't make it into the competition lineup of my school. But according to Robinson (2007), athletes often have to deal with such risk; therefore, they must make sense of their losses as much as their wins. So in this essay, I‚Äôll be treating these failures as milestones, all part of my spiritual journey as a dancer.\n\nMy first milestone happened back in high school, when I was part of the school dance crew. I auditioned for the competition team three summers in a row, and I didn‚Äôt make it each time. \nBack then, I was definitely known for my passion and hard work; outside of the dance crew, I would constantly go to intensives and pop-up classes for the sake of improvement. So getting that last rejection during senior year truly broke me. I remember breaking down backstage, thinking about quitting dance because all my efforts seemed so futile. Then, one of my coaches had a pep talk with me, where he made me reflect on my love for dance. Should I really let it be defined by results like lineups and trophies? Can I really say that I love dance if this is enough to make me quit? Because of him, I realized that I still loved dancing outside all of the rejections I experienced. Thus, I continued to pursue dance after graduating from my high school dance crew (unlike many of my former teammates).\n\nThe next milestone in my journey occurred during the pandemic, when I was still training in my old dance school (through online classes in Zoom). One of my teachers asked me if I was willing to compete for the school. I didn‚Äôt feel ready, but when does an athlete ever feel ready? This quote I saw on Instagram described how to address this apprehension so well: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt wait until you feel confident enough to act; your confidence builds as you take action.‚Äù If I didn‚Äôt take the leap of faith now, then when would I ever become brave enough? Besides, I‚Äôve always dreamt of competing, so I definitely didn‚Äôt want to miss this opportunity. Thus, I ended up dancing in 3 competitions for my studio. Another thing I learned during this process, though, would be the meaning of awards to me. Even if I wasn‚Äôt the most technically gifted dancer in my studio, I was still able to win a few awards. However, after a short period of elation, I realized that these awards didn‚Äôt mean much to me in the long-term. Perhaps it‚Äôs because of the dissatisfaction I feel with the criteria of dance competitions. Judges only see the performance that dancers show them that day, not the journey that they went through. This limited perception prioritizes technique above all. For instance, one of the dancers who placed above me (ended up being a top placer in her division) was known as a lazy dancer in the studio; she was simply able to win that place due to her raw talent. Witnessing all this showed me that awards are insubstantial in defining me as an artist-athlete.\n\nBut the experience of competing gave me the confidence to try again. One thing I wanted to try again was street dance; I quit learning this after all the rejections I got in my high school dance crew, and decided to focus on contemporary dance instead. However, I got to rekindle my love for it after doing an online mentorship with the coach of CADs (Company of Ateneo Dancers). So last year, I tried auditioning for CADs‚Äô Street division. Unfortunately, I didn‚Äôt make it in. I still held on to hope, continuing to take classes and mentorships from various teachers in street dance. But when I auditioned again the following year, I was still not able to get in. These consecutive rejections truly crushed my newfound confidence. Another thing I wanted to try again was competing for my school. When schools were shifting back to onsite set-ups , so were dance competitions. So when CADs opened up opportunities for joining their competition lineup, I didn‚Äôt hesitate in trying out. But just like my experience with the Street division, I failed to make it in the lineup ‚Äî three times too, to be exact. \n\nI would consider all these rejections as one milestone; failing to join both CADs‚Äô Street division and competition line-up multiple times felt like an intensified repeat of my high school experience. I thought to myself: why am I working so hard in an art/sport that I‚Äôm not even good at? Once again, all my efforts were futile. But looking back, I‚Äôm glad that I got these rejections. They say that when one door closes, another opens; this was definitely true in my case. I had more free time dedicated towards training for fun (i.e. doing my own cross-conditioning, going to classes for new styles/skills) and dancing with other friends (outside of my team). I don‚Äôt think I would‚Äôve enjoyed competing for CADs just as much, for I would‚Äôve been restricted in terms of time and movement; countless hours in my schedule would be dedicated towards practicing only a certain styles. What kept me dancing all these years was enjoying the process, not necessarily achieving results. So I needed to dance for myself, and not just for others.\n\nThus, I let go of my dream of competing. Perhaps I haven‚Äôt let go of this fully, given that I was able to win two dance competitions (one for solo choreography and another for group battle) last year. Maybe what I really let go of was my original plan (competing in my school team), because God has bigger plans in store for me. He knew that the path I set out for myself was a path that wasn‚Äôt meant for my dance journey. Would I say that I regret trying out all those times, knowing that I could‚Äôve saved myself a lot of pain? Even if being a constant failure is one of my biggest insecurities, I still hold no regrets; I‚Äôd rather have failed trying than not have tried at all. There is this quote from the anime *Sangatsu no Lion* that speaks to me: \"Shame has value, too. Because 'falling' means he 'challenged' something. That's hell of a lot better than a life of doing nothing, and laughing at other people.\" As a dancer, I am proud to say that I‚Äôve lived a meaningful life by constantly pushing my limits and aiming for excellence. These are traits that are treasured in not just sports, but also life, and I believe that every athlete would be able to find meaning thanks to what they‚Äôve learned in their sport.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.735605378Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2023-11-28":{"title":"\"2023-11-28\"","content":"## Aesthetics\n### Individual Report\n**Outline:**\n1.

What if the rules you follow aren't intended for good? But for keeping you in order\n- Filipino citizenship is construed in terms **‚Äúof processes by which citizens ==negotiate the nature and extent of their rights== as individuals and their obligations to the community‚Äù** (19-20).\n\t- Citizenship then is understood in the context of processes of deliberation.\n\t- In the context of democratic governance, citizenship ‚Äúis the very base of collective action, a shared vision, the means to a sustainable future, and the link to generations of citizens yet unborn‚Äù\n- Pro-active practices of citizenship consist of...\n\t- **‚Äú==indigenous, day-to-day== practices of democracy and decision-making in communities where formal government mechanisms and elected officials may or may not exist‚Äù** (Diokno, 1997: 20-21).¬† \n\t\t- In so far as communities can sort things out by themselves through truly deliberative mechanisms‚Äîwhether formal or informal‚Äîpro-active citizenship is practiced\n\t- **‚Äúinitiatives taken by ==organized== groups or sectors who engage in ==formal== democratic processes, to also explore other venues of expression and alternative solutions‚Äù** (21)\n- Aside from governance at the local level, Naga City is an example of the practice and process of pro-active citizenship.\n- Effective citizenship is a **two-way street.**\n\t- On the one hand, the **government** should ==exercise the rule of law==, and make itself ==accountable to the public==, ‚Äúwhich involves not only merely taking responsibility for one‚Äôs acts but [also] conducting oneself according to democratic ways and beliefs‚Äù (21).\n\t\t- More crucially, the government should ‚Äúensure that the ==social requisites for the practice of democracy are present:== a decent standard of living, employment, education, health and other services, and access to opportunity for improvement and a better life‚Äù (Diokno, 1997: 21).\n\t\t- It is established knowledge that people who are hungry and poor, and who have limited prospects for a better life would be too busy to concern themselves with concerns greater than their own, thus limiting opportunities for the effective exercise of citizenship.\n\t- On the other hand, **citizens** ==‚Äúneed to perform their obligations and exercise their rights‚Äù in¬† a collective manner== if they are to stand a chance in transforming institutions and structures that have repeatedly limited their capacities for a better life (Diokno, 1997: 21).\n\t\t- **Organization** is key in the politics of development.\n\t\t- Citizens acting ‚Äòin concert‚Äô, Diokno (1997) further notes, ‚Äúcan map out and implement their plans, negotiate with other entities including government, and apply pressure, when necessary, to bring about the desired change‚Äù (21).\n\n#### Seeking Leadership and Accountability\n- A crucial insight we can glean from the discussion of Diokno (1997) on effective, pro-active citizenship is that **effective leadership is a crucial capability.**\n\t- People‚Äôs participation is a function of ==organization== and an ==enabling environment,== coupled with ==‚Äúthe existence of functional leaders and members‚Äù== (27).\n\t- Oftentimes effective citizenship is ==hindered by government itself==, as it ‚Äúinfrequently appears as a role model of positive values‚Äù (26), as and in a lot of ways ‚Äúhave proved to be unreliable or unstable agents for promoting responsible citizenship and democracy‚Äù (27).\n- We are all familiar with a notion of leadership that emphasizes individual character and capability.¬† \n\t- So familiar are we to this notion that can easily name exemplars of leadership, as well as name the qualities that make them such fitting examples.¬† This is indeed a valid way of looking at the concept of leadership.¬† \n\t- Politically speaking, however, ==there is more to leadership than sheer individual effort.==\n- Bolden (2011) discusses how leadership can be understood not only as an individual pursuit, nor only about the structure or design of a system, but also as **a social process involving other agents.**¬† This is the main idea of **distributed leadership.**\n- Citing Uhl-Bien (2006), Bolden (2011) propounds that distributed leadership is ‚Äúa collective social process emerging through interactions of multiple actors‚Äù (251).¬† \n\t- Leadership is construed as ‚Äúas group activity that works through and within relationships, rather than individual action‚Äù (Bennett¬†_et.al._, 2003: 3 cited in Bolden, 2011: 252).¬† \n\t- The practice of leadership then is ‚Äúa product of the interactions of‚Ä¶_leaders_,¬†_followers_, and aspects of their¬†_situation_‚Äù (Spillane and Diamond, 2007: 7 cited in Bolden, 2011: 252 Emphases in original).\n- This notion of distributed leadership is politically salient in two ways.¬† First, distributed leadership is construed as a social process, as a function of interactions and relationships between and among people and/or organizations.¬† This resonates with how we defined politics in module 1: Politics is the process of people negotiating scarce resources involving relationships of power (Cf. Kerkvliet 2013, Leftwich 2011).¬† Leadership is political.\n- Second, distributed leadership is not simply a matter of technical design.¬† In fact, there are a variety of ways by which leadership can be distributed, as presented in Table 2 of Bolden‚Äôs (2011) essay.¬† \n\t- More crucially, Bolden (2011) notes that ‚Äú‚Äòdistributing‚Äô leadership¬†_per se_¬†is not necessarily beneficial, but that what is important is¬†_how_¬†leadership is distributed‚Äù (259 Emphases in original).¬† \n\t- The question on the manner of distribution of leadership inevitably raises the questions on the reasons for distributing leadership, on the agents/organizations controlling or managing the distribution, and the other matters being distributed.¬† \n\t- Bolden (2011) as such points out that the implementation of [distributed leadership] cannot be considered politically neutral.¬† It is motivated by a series of expectations, assumptions and agendas which, while a face value may appear reasonable enough, may actually serve to legitimize and reinforce the domination of particular individuals and groups over others (260).\n- The state responses to the pandemic (both here and abroad) are usually couched in terms of leadership.¬† Inadequate responses easily lend itself to the belief that the leadership is inadequate.¬† While that might be true in most instances, the questions should not only focus on what the leader/s lacked in terms of knowledge, skills, and attitudes.¬† In the context of distributed leadership, it is also important to look at the processes, interactions, and relationships that hinder (or facilitate) adequate responses to the pandemic.\n\n#### Towards Collective Action\n- Citizenship is not just a matter of entitlements and obligations defined by law.¬† Citizenship is ==an active practice of participating in the public life==, no matter how small such participation is.¬† \n\t- More than an exercise of rights and duties, citizenship is also ‚Äúthe very base of collective action, a shared vision, the means to a sustainable future, and the link to generations of citizens yet unborn‚Äù (Diokno, 1997: 22).\n- However, how do we turn collective action into palpable, lasting change?¬† Eric Liu (2016) asks essentially the same question: [\"Eric Liu: How to turn protest into powerful change\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_g1BMVFcuw). Here are three core strategies are involved.\n\t- First,¬†**expand the frame of the possible**.¬† \n\t\t- The first battle is waged not necessarily on physical spaces (public parks, streets), but on the ==spaces of the civic imagination.==¬† \n\t\t- As Liu (2016) emphasizes, ==asking the ‚Äòwhat if‚Äô question,== ‚Äúand not taking as given all the givens of conventional politics‚Äù is the important first step.¬† \n\t\t- However, expanding the frame of the possible needs some level of concreteness, otherwise what is being imagined becomes simply impossible.\n\t- This leads to the second step:¬†**choose a defining fight**.¬† \n\t\t- More than trying to answer the question on that which you want to fight for, this step is about defining the boundaries of the fight.¬† \n\t\t- ==‚ÄúPowerful citizens set the terms of [the] contrast‚Äù== between an ‚Äòus‚Äô and a ‚Äòthem‚Äô, which is the fundamental characteristic of politics.¬† \n\t\t- This distinction, however, must always be¬†_agonistic_¬†in that parties involved in the debate still respect each other‚Äôs humanity and rights, eschewing primarily the resort to violence.\n\t- The third and last step is¬†**finding an early win.**¬†¬†\n\t\t- Liu (2016) emphasizes that such win, ‚Äúeven if it‚Äôs not as ambitious as the ultimate goal, ==creates momentum, which changes what people think is possible==‚Äù.¬† \n\t\t- The important thing to remember, however, is that what eventually would lead to palpable, lasting change is ‚Äú[n]ot the single triumph, but ==the long, slow slog==‚Äù.¬† Early wins set in motion the grind necessary for changes to happen, and to be sustained.\n- A concrete example is the story of McKenna Pope: [\"McKenna Pope: Want to be an activist? Start with your toys\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTK_cJVryIc#action=share)\n\t- Obviously, you live in a context different from Pope‚Äôs, and you might not have the same resources as she has.¬† More blatantly, her problems might not be your problems.¬† You might not even be the kind of person who goes to rallies.¬† It does not matter.¬† As Liu (2016) notes: **‚ÄúYou just have to be a participant, and to live like a citizen‚Äù.**¬† And if I may add, there is always ‚Äútime to fight for a cause greater than ourselves‚Äù.\n\n\n### Individual Synthesis Essay\n#### Guidelines\n\u003e Using insights from Diokno (1997), in what ways can you deepen and concretely live out your¬†duty of allegiance to the political community?¬†[500-700 words].\n\nDiokno ‚ÄúBecoming a Filipino citizen: Perspectives on citizenship and democracy‚Äù.\n\n#### Essay\n##### Outline\n**Diokno ideas**\n- Filipinos struggle with identifying with an abstraction\n- Good citizenship is not just about following laws....it is an active practice of participating in the public life. \n\t- It is collectively working towards a sustainable future\n- Filipino citizenship = processes of how citizens negotiate the nature and extent of their rights\n- How to proactively practice citizenship:\n\t- Grassroots practices in community\n\t- Participate in initiatives of organized groups?\n- Effective citizenship is a two-way street...both government and citizens should participate\n- How to turn collective action into change\n\t- Expand the frame of the possible\n\t- Choose a defining fight\n\t- Finding an early win\n- [How a fresh graduate convinced QC gov‚Äôt to make new pedestrian lanes in Katipunan](https://www.rappler.com/nation/metro-manila/fresh-graduate-convinces-quezon-city-government-make-new-pedestrian-lanes-katipunan-avenue/)\n\t- _'All I really wanted to do was to show others that things do still work at the local government level, which is usually presumed to not be working, or which does not listen to people,'_\n\t- Process: \n\t\t- Phone call to the QC government unit that's responsible (requests for road repairs can be submitted through phone calls, letters, or walk-ins at the Quezon City Hall Compound.)\n\t\t- ‚ÄúI think what complemented my request was that I tweeted about it.

It's basically all about unplugging and retreating from technology. \n\u003e ==philosophy of relating to technology== I call Waldenponding (after ==Thoreau's Walden Pond experiment== on which Walden is based). The crude caricature is \"smash your smart phone and go live in a log cabin to reclaim your attention and your life from being hacked by evil social media platforms.\"\n- It is driven by FOBO: [[Cards/Fear of Being Ordinary]] and ego-attachment.\n\t- FOBO is the opposite of FOMO: Fear of Missing Out. This is exploited by third parties who aim to drown you in information.\n\n\u003e If FOMO, Fear Of Missing Out, is the basic fear exploited by third parties that want to drown you in information, the basic fear exploited by people telling you to unplug and retreat is ==FOBO: Fear Of Being Ordinary.==\n\n\n\u003e Waldenponding, I strongly suspect, is ==driven more by FOBO and ego-attachment== than by any real fear of having your mind, productive potential, and rewards destroyed by \"hacked attention.\"\n- Retreating from information flows is just ==a different way of having your attention hacked by others.==\n![[Extras/Media/Images/Attention Management Turnpike.png]]\n- **Attention Management Turnpike** *(pictured above)*\n\t- Great Thoughts Time\n\t- X Axis: OODA: Observe, Orient, Decide, Act\n\t- Y Axis: Small minds -\u003e great minds \n\t\n\u003e Inspiration from 2 sources: The famous quote ==\"small minds discuss people, average minds discuss events, great minds discuss ideas\"== ( = y axis) and Richard Hamming's idea of scheduling ==\"Great Thoughts\"== calendar time in You and Your Research\n\n![[Extras/Media/Images/Great Thoughts.png]]\n- We are part of a ==Giant Social Computer in the Cloud (GSCITC)== computing the future. \t\t\n\t- Our \"job\" in this computer is determined by the ==level (size/difficulty) and latency (delay)== at which you consume and act on information \n\t- Shitposting and FOMO actually has a use\n\n\u003e you are part of a ==Giant Social Computer in the Cloud (GSCITC)== computing the future. ==The level and latency at which you consume information and act on it determines your \"job\" in the social computer.== Your shitposting and FOMO are functional.\n\n\u003e Premise: ==FOMO is good.== Being plugged in is good. There is valuable info at all levels from twitter gossip to philosophy books. You should stay plugged in.\n\n- If you don't stay informed, you'll end up with the lowest-level job in the social computer: ==process low-latency information with small-minded cognition.== \n\t- A.k.a. low-level bug reporting/testing\n\t- E.G. [transcribing user audio](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-13/facebook-paid-hundreds-of-contractors-to-transcribe-users-audio)\n\t- Need to upskill basically\n\n\u003e If you don't manage your information economy career, you will default to the lowest-level job in the social computer: ==processing very low-latency information with small-minded cognition (bottom left) for small bets.== It's the equivalent of low-level bug reporting/testing.\n- You can manage your attention by: \n\t- ==being aware== of your current mind size (small to great) \n\t- ==consciously targeting== the zone you want to be in.\n\n\u003e The way to manage your attention is to ==be sensitive to your current mind size (small to great)== and ==consciously target the zone you want to be in,== moving fluidly between small/great mind.\n\n- Failure: an information diet that doesn't enable you to translate your information consumption/production choices into winning bets\n\t- Summary of ==three ways to fail:==\n\t\t- trying to be Great Minded all the time\n\t\t- trying to be Great Minded with a mostly low-latency information diet\n\t\t- trying to consume a high-latency information diet without aspiring to create more than small-minded thoughts\n\n\n\u003e There are ==THREE ways to fail== at this: a) Thinking you can be Great Minded all the time. b) Trying to be Great Minded purely on a low-latency information diet (upper-left red box) c) Trying to consume a high-latency information diet without aspiring to more than small-minded thoughts (lower-right red box)\n\n\u003e Each failure mode is an information diet that leads to patterns of betting that fail to deliver a positive return long-term. It's not addictive FOMOing that kills you, but not being able to translate the information consumption/production choices you're making into winning bets.\n\n- 1st failure mode: trying to consume only information at your target level\n\t- Information diet input is ==needed from all levels to work at any level==\n\t- E.G. trying to \"float\" atention at a focused point \n\t- the danger in this is that ==your mind-level might choose you==, instead of the other way around\n\n\u003e The first failure mode manifests as trying to consume only information at your target level. This will fail. ==You need some information diet input from ALL levels to work at ANY level==\n\n\u003e  ==Trying to \"float\" your attention at a focused point on the turnpike== rather than distributing attention all along it is the other way to ==fail==\n\n\u003e  The danger in executing this turnpike roadmap strategy is that ==your mind-level might choose you rather than you choosing your mind-level.==\n\n- 2nd failure mode: trying to output ==Great Thoughts== with only ==low-latency live information==\n\n\u003e  The second failure mode manifests as ==trying to have Great Thoughts on a diet of pure low-latency live information== (upper-left red box).\n- 3rd failure mode: keeping up with all information at all latencies with a ==small-minded level==\n\t- The more latency there is, the bigger mind you need\n\n\u003e The final failure mode is trying to ==keep up with all the information at all latencies at a small-minded level== (lower-right red box).\n\n\u003e Higher latency requires ==higher abstraction levels/bigger minds== to extract value.\n- Training attention is like ==weight training.== \n\t- You need to increase your load slowly (e.g. 10s -\u003e 10min), and maybe train to exhaustion.\n\t\t- Small mind and can only read/make tweets? Try an essay\n\t\t- Great mind and can only process philosophy books? Try Twitter for 15min\n\t\t\t- like low-weights/high-volume endurance training\n\n\n\u003e This is a bit like ==weight training.== You have to increase the weights slowly and perhaps ==train your attention to exhaustion== a bit. If you're in small mind zone and can only consume/produce tweets, try an essay. See how far you get. Strength-train attention from 10s to 10min. You can and should go the other way as well. If you can only read big philosophy books by dead people and processing the chaotic churn of a Toxic Day on Twitter is too much for you, try handling it for 15 minutes, then an hour. Try posting instead of just reading. This is like ==low-weights/high-volume endurance training.== Harder than it looks.\n\n\n- The ==load== you're training against: ==attention-hacking designs.== \n- But the atrophying of attention and latency limits will always happen due to the ==information firehose,== a.k.a. the result of free/cheap information distribution in our digital world\n\n\n\u003e  this ==atrophying of attention and latency limits== will happen REGARDLESS of whether evil designers are trying to hack your attention and keep you phase-locked into their preferred 10s latency information loop. ==Their designs are in fact the LOAD you're training against==\n\n\u003e  information distribution has become free/cheap, so the firehose is going to have flows at all timescales, time constants, and abstraction levels no matter what designers and advertisers want or don't want. ==It's the information firehose itself that's creating this environment not evil designers.==\n- Back in a pre-digital world, attention was originally hacked by powerful religious leaders who'd tell people to unplug from information flows, giving them power as a result.\n\t- Also based on [[Cards/Fear of Being Ordinary]]\n\n\n\u003e ==the original attention hack: powerful religious leaders== telling smart people to check out and unplug from information flows. That way, they get the power\n\n\n\u003e  This game is based on the opposite fear to FOMO which I call FOBO. If FOMO is Fear of Missing Out, FOBO is Fear Of Being Ordinary.\n- In the GSCITC, we are simply a ==unique instance== of a computerized human intelligence. \n\t- However, the GSCITC cannot give you ==individual recognition.==\n\t- This flattens our egos and identities.\n\t- This is the heart of [[Cards/Fear of Being Ordinary]]. We just don't want to be another component of the GSCTIC; our efforts aren't recognized even if they contribute to the system\n\n\n\u003e When you are plugged into the GSCITC, ==you are part of a great computational fluidization of human cognition.== You're just ==one instance== in a liquid cloud of human intelligence, your thoughts entangled with those of others in a giant ongoing computation.\n\n\n\u003e  This fluidization is a different eme rgent social phenomenon from the homogenization achieved by Organization Man corporations. ==Instead of being a faceless interchangeable part, you are a unique entangled particle in a quantum soup.==\n\n\n\u003e  The cost though is that even if your contributions are unique and your personal payoff makes it worthwhile if you do it right, ==the one thing the liquid cloud can't offer you is individual recognition.==\n\n\u003e  The GSCITC is not a homogenizer of effort or imagination, but ==it IS a homogenizer of egos and identities. ==What you do counts. Who you are doesn't. You are an ordinary part of an extraordinary process.\n\n\u003e  This is the heart of FOBO. Fear of Being Ordinary. ==Fear of being just another entangled particle in the GSCITC.== Fear of your ego dissolving into the collective ego. Fear of having \"nothing to show\" for playing a part, despite it being sustainable.\n\n- A real adept should be able to: \n\t- 1.) turn even the most toxic Twitter  stream into ==actionable insight==\n\t- 2.) have ==strength-trained attention,== so that they can consume whatever they want \n\n\n\u003e A real adept oughta be able to meditate on the angriest, most toxic twitter stream, consume the bile, and turn it into nectar: ==actionable insight you can bet on in the real world.==\n\n\u003e  ==A real adept ought to have strength-trained attention== so they can spend an hour either reading a tweetstream or a once-in-a-generation history-disrupting philosophy book.\n- Overall, the GSCITC is the ==only mechanism enabling us to tackle world problems== (that industrial age mechanisms couldn't cope with). So we need to do our best in it by staying connected.\n\n\n\u003e We are all now part of a powerful global social computer in the cloud that is possibly ==the only mechanism we have available to tackle the big problems of the world that industrial age mechanisms are failing to cope with.== We might as well get good at it. Do your part. Stay as plugged in as you can.\n\n### Against Waldenponding 2\n- Horcrux allegory (don't trust a tangible soul) vital to our relationship with digital devices. However, digital devices aren't horcruxes; in reality, they're the ==Walden ponds.==\n\n\u003e never trust anything that can make its own meaning if you can see where it keeps its soul.\n\n\u003e \"soul\" loosely as a ==metaphor for meaning-making ability.==\n\n\u003e Unlike intelligence, a soul (metaphoric or literal) ==isn't supposed to take on such a tangible form factor==\n\n\u003e Meaning-making entities -- humans, and organizations -- can only be trusted if they don't seem to know for sure where their soul is.\n\n\u003e Believe it or not, this nebulous philosophical allegory is central to the seemingly mundane question of ==how much time you should be spending staring at the screens of digital devices.== Interestingly though, it is NOT our digital devices that are the untrustworthy horcruxes in this story. ==The true horcruxes are the objects that waldenponders believe are more deserving of your attention: the Walden ponds.==\n- [[Cards/You have agency over your own attention]].\n\t- E.G. ad blockers, cogntive frames\n\t- Therefore, if you think your attention is getting \"hacked\", it's because you're allowing it\n\n\n\u003e you aren't an NPC -- non-playing/playable character -- in the battle for your own attention. You have tools ranging from ad blockers to cognitive reframes. If you're letting your attention get \"hacked\", it's because you're choosing to. ==If you think the only kind of agency you have is the agency to uncritically withdraw to save your soul, you've been pwned, but it isn't by the tech platforms.==\n- Waldenponding is the ==demonization of digital devices.== \n\t- But devices are actually more like magic tricks; they're designed by humans to misdirect your attention.\n\t- Manipulate you into creating Walden ponds\n\n\n\u003e  ==Waldenponding = primitivist, fetishistic fear of screens as demonic objects.== A way of relating to digital devices that seems shaped by a fearmongering vision of them as soul-sucking pumps, and their designers as Dark Lords who are far too powerful for you, mere mortal,  to actively resist. Your only reliable weapon, they say, is the off switch.\n\n\u003e  ==demonization of digital devices== -- perfectly ordinary objects governed by the laws of physics and designed by mere humans --  is something like a magic trick, where the magician wants to misdirect your attention. While you're busy worrying about the evil rectangles of light stealing your soul, you are missing the real danger: the horcruxes they are tempting you to create and trust with legibilized, dead bits of your soul.\n\n- Waldenponding is a search for meaning similar to ==idolization.== The idol here can be anything that's not a digital device.\n\t- E.G. paper book, session of manual labor, hike in the woods\n\t- They act as tangible focal points which the quests (for meaning) ==revolve around,== preventing one from going too far.\n\t- This is what makes Waldenponding dangerous, and it's worse because it's ==seen as a way to do the opposite== (idolization)\n\n\u003e  Waldenponding is a search for meaning that is ==circumscribed by the what you might call the spiritual gravity field of an object or behavior held up as ineffably sacred.== The associated literal pattern of religiosity is idolatry. Today, the ==\"idol\"== in question is generally characterized by negative definition as ==\"almost anything other than the profane digital device screen.\"== It can take a variety of forms: the in-person conversation, the board game, the hike in the woods, the session of manual labor, the construction project, the family dinner, the paper book. All are excellent things, to be valued for what they literally are. But as suggested repositories for bits of your soul, they are incredibly dangerous.\n\n\u003e  the loci at the hearts of the narratives are more than mere motifs or synecdoches for larger spiritual quests. They serve as ==physically embodied focal points around which the quests themselves revolve,== like strange attractors. Though the protagonists may, through the narrative, explore the universe in much more expansive ways, you can see where they keep bits of their souls locked down; the zone that keeps drawing them back; the idol that prevents them from wandering too far.\n\n\u003e  Each in its natural form is a perfectly fine thing. ==It is only when transformed into sacralized fragments of \"soul\" that they turn into dangerous Dark Magic objects. Waldenponding is dangerous because it encourages you to do exactly that.== The effect is particularly insidious because it is presented as a way to do the opposite.\n- How to tell if it's a horcrux:\n\t- 1.) Do you know where it keeps its brain?\n\t\t- For devices: brain = intelligence\n\t- 2.) Does it seem to embody a \"soul\" tangibly?\n\t\t- For device: legible piece of soul?\n\n\n\u003e Horcrux tests: ==do you know where it keeps its brain?== And ==Does it seem to embody a \"soul\" in more tangible form than you'd expect== from our everyday casual-spiritual sense of the term?\n\n\u003e  Same tests applied to devices: ==Do you know where it keeps its intelligence? And Is it a legible piece of soul?==\n- Tested on Waldenponds:\n\t- 1.) No. Waldenponder object/activity pairs are shown as a device connected to a collation of inherited ==cultural intelligence==\n\t\t- this cannot be investigated; you can only surrender to it through ==ritualistic behaviors==\n\t- 2.) Yes. They are the ==secular equivalents of temples.==\n\n\u003e  First horcrux answer: Nope! ==Each object/activity pair is usually portrayed by waldenponders as a client device connected to a vast cloud of inherited cultural intelligence.== And they are right! Each of these objects/behavior is a classic horcrux candidate because it is ==old enough for illegible, unplottable patterns of cultural intelligence to have formed around it. You cannot probe this intelligence, only surrender to it through ceremonial, mythologized behaviors==\n\n\n\u003e  Second horcrux answer: Yep! Waldenponders talk of these things as tangible embodiments and reliable catalysts of ineffable states of mind. They are ==secular equivalents of temples.==\n- Tested on devices:\n\t- 1.) Yes (e.g. RAM, data center, etc.)\n\t- 2.) No. Digital life does not have an exact address, form, or predictable way to find it (which is why we rely so much on search functions).\n\n\n\u003e Answers: yes (it‚Äôs in ram, data center, etc.) and no (==While there is definitely a soul to digital life, it definitely does not have an exact address or form or a predictable way to find it.== The locus of \"soul\" in digital media is so nebulous, our entire experience of online life is necessarily built around search functions.

And all through the Scriptures, God‚Äôs glory is about two things: Presence and beauty.\n   \n   \u003e God‚Äôs   kavod   here   isn‚Äôt   his   fame;   it‚Äôs   his   presence   ‚Äî   the   fact   that   he   was   there ,   not   far   away,   but   close.   Heav- en and earth were wed, if only for a moment. And it‚Äôs his beauty ‚Äî this staggering sense of how good he really is.\n- [[Cards/God is an artist]].\n   \u003e God is a lavish, opulent,   extravagant   artist ,   and   creation   is   his   beauty   on   display.\n\n\n   \u003e As people made in his image ‚Äî all work is artistic. All work is inherently creative. All work ‚Äî from painting to parenting ‚Äî is reshaping the raw materials of Planet Earth in such a way that it‚Äôs how God intended, how it‚Äôs supposed to be, all so humans can thrive as they see God‚Äôs glory.\n- ==We are God's partners in creation.==\n   \u003e  As   people   made   in   God‚Äôs   image,   we   can   join   him   in   this   ongoing   creative   work.   As   his   partners,   we   can   re- shape   the   raw   materials   of   his   world   in   such   a   way   that   people   see   the   beauty   behind   the   beauty. \n\n\n    \u003e  ‚ÄúGood design is putting our best forward; it is working hard to bring beauty into the world. When I see something that is brilliant it wrecks me in the best sort of way. I am also constantly returning to this idea that we were created with the ability to create and that makes our God the most generous of all. I‚Äôm humbled after I complete every new project, and as I stand there with a big silly grin on my face, I feel his presence and approval.‚Äù\n- ADHD, stress, etc. are just ==symptoms of an unraveling world/culture.==\n    \u003e We   are   fractured   and   pulled   in   a   thousand   different   directions. ADHD, stress, workaholism, burnout, connectivity ‚Äî these are just words we come up with to name a world that is unraveling at the seams.\n\n\n    \u003e  These are the signs of a life without rest.\n- To be a ==disciple== is to be a ==good person.==\n    \u003e Discipleship   is   about   learning   how   to   become   a   good   human   being.   And   how   to   live   into   both   your   callings, to   make   disciples   and   to   create   culture.  \n\n\n    \u003e Do your work as an expression of love and service, ultimately to God, and then to your neighbor.\n- Focus requires ==awareness of what we are called to== and NOT called to.\n    \u003e To   focus,   we   need   to   know   what   we‚Äôre   called   by   God   to   do,   and   what   we‚Äôre   not   called   to   do. \n\n\n    \u003e To borrow from the language of Jesus, you gotta figure what the ‚Äúwork the Father gave you to do‚Äù is. And   then   you   need   to   learn   the   art   of   saying   no.   To   good   things .   A   smart   man   once   said,   ‚ÄúGood   is   the   enemy of   best.‚Äù \n\n\n    \u003e So we all have gifts, but we don‚Äôt all have the same dosage of grace. Some of us have more; others have less. And that‚Äôs okay. Your   job   isn‚Äôt   to   be   the   best   in   your   field,   just   the   best   version   of   yourself.\n- [[Cards/The best way to serve others with our work is to serve the work]].\n    \u003e A genuine, authentic love of excellence isn‚Äôt rooted in greed or narcissism or materialism ‚Äî that‚Äôs dualism talking.   It‚Äôs   rooted   in   love ,   for   God   and   others.   A   desire   to   serve   God   and   his   world   well. \n    \n\t\u003e Dorothy Sayers, this spunky, rebellious British writer from half a century ago, said that the best way to serve others with our work is to ‚Äúserve the work.‚Äù\n    \n\t\u003e Do one thing. And   do   one   thing   well . And do that one thing well as an act of service and love for the world and to the glory of God.\n    \n\t\u003e If you‚Äôre really good at whatever it is you do, you don‚Äôt need to tell the rest of us. We‚Äôll know. Beautiful things don‚Äôt ask for attention.\n- [[Cards/Work can become a god in and of itself]].\n    \u003e My point is that as human beings, we have this slant to look to our work for significance we can only find in God. When we uncouple our work from God, work becomes a sort of god in and of itself.\n\n\n    \u003e Because the curse drives us to God. If it weren‚Äôt for the curses ‚Äî on both the family and the field ‚Äî we would look to whatever it is we do for work   or   rest,   and   we   would   find   it .   And   nothing   could   be   more   disastrous   for   the   world   than   God‚Äôs   image   bear- ers finding identity and belonging and even satisfaction apart from him.\n- Sabbath isn't just a day of rest; it's a ==day to delight in our work.==\n    \u003e Sabbath   isn‚Äôt   just   a   day   to   not   work ;   it‚Äôs   a   day   to   delight   in   what   one   Hebrew   poet   called   ‚Äúthe   work   of   our hands.‚Äù ¬≥   To   delight   in   the   life   you‚Äôve   carved   out   in   partnership   with   God,   to   delight   in   the   world   around   you, and to delight in God himself. Sabbath is a day to pull up a chair, sink into it, look back over the work of the last six   days,   and   just   enjoy.\n- Sabbath gives us ==life.==\n    \u003e The Sabbath has a life-giving ability to procreate ‚Äî to fill the world up with life.\n\n\n    \u003e But   rest   refills   us   ‚Äî   with   energy,   creativity,   vision,   strength,   optimism,   buoy- ancy, clarity, and hope. Rest is life-giving.\n\n\n    \u003e It‚Äôs   a   day   for   rest,   and   it‚Äôs   a   day   for   worship. When I Sabbath, I run everything through this grid ‚Äî is this rest? Is this worship? If the answer to both questions is yes, then I delight in it; if the answer is no, then I hold off until the next day. Because the Sabbath is not the same thing as a day off.\n\n\n    \u003e The   point   is   that   there   is   a   way   the   Creator   set   the   creation up   to   thrive.   A   way   that   God   set   you   up   to   thrive.   And   when   we   Sabbath,   we   tap   into   God‚Äôs   rhythm   for   human flourishing.\n\n\n    \u003e The Sabbath is a day to embrace this reality, to let it sink in, to own it, to celebrate it. To celebrate our weak- ness,   our   mortality,   our   limits .   To   celebrate   our   God   of   strength   and   immortality   and   limitless   power.   To   rest with   him   and   to   rest   in   him.\n- [[Cards/Everything has a cost]].\n    \u003e Everything   we enjoy costs something. And if it doesn‚Äôt cost us, it costs someone else.\n- The Sabbath is ==freeing.==\n    \u003e The Sabbath is about leaving Egypt behind. About emancipation from Pharaoh‚Äôs suffocating rule. It‚Äôs about freedom.\n\n\n    \u003e It‚Äôs   a   way   to   remember   and   never   forget   that   what   we‚Äôre   craving,   and   even coveting, isn‚Äôt found in the world of space, but in the world of time ‚Äî in God himself.\n    \n\t\u003e The Sabbath is more of an art form than a list of dos and don‚Äôts.\n    \n\t\u003e the   Sabbath   is   a   day   for   healing.\n- Jesus is the ==embodiment== of the Sabbath.\n    \u003e Jesus is the embodiment of the Sabbath. He‚Äôs the seventh day in flesh and blood. We can come to him and find   rest ,   not   just   on   the   Sabbath,   but   all   week   long.\n- The Sabbath gives us a chance to ==reset and realign.==\n    \u003e  Sabbath isn‚Äôt just a Pause button ‚Äî it‚Äôs a full, complete, total system restart.\n    \n\t\u003e Sabbath is a chance to take a long, hard look at our lives and to retune them to the right key. To make sure that our life is shaped around what really matters. And when we see stuff in our life that is out of whack, then we turn to Jesus, and he comes and does his healing Sabbath work.\n- Our ==eschatology== shapes our ==ethics.==\n- Our work in this life is ==practice for our work in the coming life.==\n   \u003e Work   isn‚Äôt   a   means   to   an   end;   it   is   an   end.\n   \n   \u003e Our   work   in   this   life   is   practice   for   our   work   in   the   coming   life.\n   \n   \u003e Some of the good work we do will actually last into God‚Äôs new world.\n    \n\t\u003e So   we   work   in   the   present   world   ‚Äî   right   in   the   middle   of   all   the   chaos   and   entropy   and   suffering   and   pain   ‚Äî for   a   glimpse   of   the   future   world,   set   free   from   evil   and   death   itself.\n","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.735605378Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Literature-Notes/Half-Baked-Futures-Literature-Notes":{"title":"Half-Baked Futures - Literature Notes","content":"See [[Sources/Half-Baked Futures - Newsletter]]\n#literaturenotes \n## All the world's a stage + communicative friction\n- [[Cards/context collapse]] \n\u003e But our friends lists grew longer and further from the notion of friendship, a phenomenon that Internet scholar danah boyd dubbed ==\"context collapse\".== We began to filter our words: Is this important enough to post?

The literature presented in their proposal was filled with scientific terms which helped make the case of their vision as modern and data-driven.\n\t+ ==A utilitarian vision is easier to sell politically== than a romantic one proposed by Dewey, especially when it comes to expensive publicly-supported institutions like education. While Dewey talked about engaging the interest of the child to promote a richer understanding of the world to promote a more just and richer society, the administrative progressives talked about ==fixing social problems and expanding the economy.==\n+ Instead of Dewey's vision, the administration ran with a ==social efficiency agenda== as an expression of democratic ideals.\n+ Changes that took place:\n\t+ the structure of curriculum tracking\n\t+ the tailoring of instruction to the academic skills of individual students\n\t+ the use of standardized testing for student placement\n\t+ the shift from purely academic studies to a more practical nature.\n\n### Why Snedden's view on education is problematic\n+ he viewed education as a way to prepare for a person's calling in life.\n+ way of thinking is one that optimizes for social efficiency and is discriminatory: he believed that only the elites should obtain liberal education while the rest of the people should be trained in a vocation.\n\t+ [[Cards/Education lives within a system of domination and liberation]]\n+ Is Snedden's vocationalism is the answer to ending poverty? Critics have argued that it does not.\n\t+ In this model of education (people are either consumers or producers), education is a tool to increase their potential earnings and escape poverty; the status quo is always upheld. ==When someone is educated, another uneducated person slots right into the role.==\n+ On the contrary, Dewey's vision of democratic education serves more beyond increasing earning potential. He envisioned that with proper rich education experience, ==people will be better equipped to cure social ills== that need to be addressed including poverty and crime as well as health concerns.\n\n## Vocationalism today\n### Vocational schools and coding bootcamps\n+ Types:\n\t+ Vocational school\n\t+ Coding bootcamps with ISAs\n\t+ companies partnering up with Institutions to either sponsor education or work collaboratively to set a curriculum.\n+ As corporations become partners with education providers, a ==conflict-of-interest== emerges.\n\u003e While a tuition-free education along with a part-time salary sounds like a sweet deal for students, Lutchen believes it‚Äôs the schools that stand to gain the most, financially speaking. He explains that a significant proportion of students require financial aid, with each one reducing the institution‚Äôs overall revenue. When a private company is paying the tab, however, the university is able to collect on the full cost.\n\u003e \n\u003e ‚ÄúThe mission of the institution is not to create employees for a specific company with a narrow set of skills that only that company can use; that would violate the mission of the undergraduate experience,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIn fact, about 40% of engineers end up not working in engineering 10, 15 years after they graduate, so that would be a big concern.‚Äù\n\u003e \n\u003e ‚ÄúThe student is made to feel committed to the program rather than have an open mind, because the tuition dollars will stop if they want to switch majors,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why we would not do that. We would say ‚Äòpay us a certain amount to be on the steering committee, be a member of a consortium of companies.‚Äô And then we know we‚Äôre preparing students for a variety of corporate pathways, not just one.‚Äù\n\n\n### Microcredentials and universities\n+ **Microcredentials:**  compressed online courses with a highly targeted curriculum to allow the learner to apply the knowledge directly to a workplace.\n+ interesting phenomenon:  a partnership between universities with online providers such as EdX to provide these microcredentials.\n+  On the surface, the movement sounds like a great idea for students: unbundling university courses ==lowers the price==, and removing admission requirements also makes the courses ==more accessible.== \n+ However, a ==conflict of interest== between students and corporation might arise by engaging with microcredential production:\n\n\u003e As microcredentialing purveyors, colleges and universities also make themselves increasingly subservient to their new clients: businesses and corporations in need of rapid, targeted vocational training for their employees. The traditional mission of enabling student growth through transformative teaching is traded for a corporate mission of ==maximizing efficiency and profitability at all costs.==\n\n\n\u003e the boom in microcredentials is being fed in large part by major companies‚ÄîIBM, Google, and Amazon, to name a few‚Äîlooking to ==grow their talent pipeline== and ==increase the skill level of current employees==\n\n+ Microcredentials contribute to the ==decline of the traditional degree== by paving a way for people to substitute degree programs. For instance, Kazin and Clerkin ask, ‚Äòwhy should an individual bother to pursue a full master‚Äôs degree if five courses alone are enough to confer career success?‚Äô.\n\n## Conclusion\n+ Dewey believed...\n\t+ that a broad and diverse liberal education will lead to more well-rounded individuals who will then be better able to contribute to a democratic society in order to ==solve social ills.== \n\t+ that an education that is vocational (i.e. an education I can fully apply to the workplace) is an effective way to maintain the status quo and is ==ineffective for large scale changes==:\n\n\u003e The kind of vocational education in which I am interested is not one which will ‚Äòadapt‚Äô workers to the existing industrial regime; I am not sufficiently in love with the regime for that. It seems to me that the business of all who would not be educational time-servers is to resist every move in this direction, and to strive for a kind of vocational education which will ==first alter the existing industrial system, and ultimately transform it==].\n\n![Left Behind](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3ead8a6f-03cb-4213-8895-e975fa35cac5_1312x1002.png)\n\n+ When viewed through the lens of job creation and boosting the economy, vocational education does a good job at upholding that. However, in the lens of education and democracy, ==vocationalism strikes to undermine democracy.==\n\n\u003e It is not sufficient, and it may actually undermine our democracy, to concentrate on producing people who do well on standardized tests and who define success as getting a well-paid job. ==Democracy means more than voting and maintaining economic productivity, and life means more than making money and beating others to material goods.==\n\n+ In his paper, Ralston described that ==microcredentials fall short of educating a whole person.== The point he brings up works equally well when we replace microcredentials with vocationalism.\n\t+ [[Cards/Critical thinking and skill development are not mutually exclusive]]\n\n\u003e Microcredentialing is unconcerned with educating the whole person. Unlike Liberal Arts education, which catalyzes changes in the entire character of the learner, vocationally oriented microcredentialing ==seeks only to transfer hard skills and technical competencies== to the client-learner. In the absence of a General Education component, microcredentialing tends to ==cultivate only a single dimension, aspect, or element of the learner‚Äôs character, effectively producing a technician, not a well-rounded person.== Past president of the University of Chicago, Robert Hutchins (1936/1958), voiced a similar complaint about vocational train- ing: ‚ÄòThe pursuit of knowledge for its own sake is being rapidly obscured in universities and may soon be extinguished. [ . .] [S]oon everybody in a university will be there for the purpose of being trained for something. [ . .] It is plain, though, that it is bad for the universities to vocationalize them‚Äô (36‚Äì7). Insofar as microcredentialing fails to educate the whole person, it exacerbates one symptom of the neoliberal learning economy, namely, the turn away from pursuing knowledge for its own sake and towards learning to earn (Siskin and Warner 2019).\n\n\n+ By providing vocational training exclusively, higher education institutions cut their students off from more elevated pursuits (e.g. art, history, cultural studies) and ==condemn them to a life of subservience to their industrial and corporate masters.==","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.735605378Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Literature-Notes/Monomythical-Literature-Notes":{"title":"Monomythical - Literature Notes","content":"## Notes\n#literaturenotes \nSee [[notes/1.

This results in repeated destruction of intelligent civilizations.\n\u003e from author Liu Ciuxin‚Äôs The Three Body Problem, about the universe\n\u003e the Earth is awaiting an invasion from the closest star system, which in this universe consists of three solar-type stars orbiting each other in an unstable three-body system, with a single Earth-like planet unhappily being passed among them and suffering extremes of heat and cold, as well as the repeated destruction of its intelligent civilizations.\n- Is our universe an empty forest or a dark one? Definitely dark.\n\t- Only Earth is foolish enough to announce itself; the rest of the universe knows why the forest stays dark.\n\t- ==The Internet too has dark forests==, and we're going back to them thanks to the noise of ads, trolling, etc.\n \u003e  Imagine a dark forest at night. It‚Äôs deathly quiet. Nothing moves. Nothing stirs. This could lead one to assume that the forest is devoid of life. But of course, it‚Äôs not. The dark forest is full of life. It‚Äôs quiet because night is when the predators come out. To survive, the animals stay silent.\n \u003e  Is our universe an empty forest or a dark one? If it‚Äôs a dark forest, then only Earth is foolish enough to ping the heavens and announce its presence. The rest of the universe already knows the real reason why the forest stays dark. It‚Äôs only a matter of time before the Earth learns as well.\n \u003e  In response to the ads, the tracking, the trolling, the hype, and other predatory behaviors, we‚Äôre retreating to our dark forests of the internet, and away from the mainstream.\n - Dark forests in the internet are spaces that make ==conversation without pressure== possible.\n\t - This is because of their ==non-indexed, non-optimized, and non-gamified== environments.\n\t - E.G. newsletters, podcasts, Slack channels, private Instagrams, invite-only message boards, text groups, Snapchat, Wechat, etc.\n \u003e  Dark forests like newsletters and podcasts are growing areas of activity. As are other dark forests, like Slack channels, private Instagrams, invite-only message boards, text groups, Snapchat, WeChat, and on and on.\n \u003e  These are all spaces where depressurized conversation is possible because of their non-indexed, non-optimized, and non-gamified environments.\n - Right now,  the public and semi-public spaces we've created are now spaces for ==a relentless competition for power. (e.g. market, political, social)==\n\t - Originally, they were created to ==develop our identities, cultivate communities, and gain knowledge.==\n\t - Because of the growth of this competition, we've retreated to dark forests.\n \u003e  The public and semi-public spaces we created to develop our identities, cultivate communities, and gain knowledge were overtaken by forces using them to gain power of various kinds (market, political, social, and so on).\n \u003e This is the atmosphere of the mainstream web today: a relentless competition for power. As this competition has grown in size and ferocity, an increasing number of the population has scurried into their dark forests to avoid the fray.\n- Dark forests provide ==psychological and reputational cover==; since we know who else is there, we can be our truest selves.\n\t- More Scandivanian in values and social + emotional security\n\t- Versus the communication style of mass channels\n\t\t- High risks + rewards, and limited moderation\n\u003e  The dark forests grow because they provide psychological and reputational cover. They allow us to be ourselves because we know who else is there. Compared to the free market communication style of the mass channels ‚Äî with their high risks, high rewards, and limited moderation ‚Äî dark forest spaces are more Scandinavian in their values and the social and emotional security they provide. \n - According to the [[Cards/Bowling Alley Theory of the Internet]], people go online just to meet each other. In the long term, the venues we congregate in are unimportant compared to the ==interactions themselves.==\n \u003e  the Bowling Alley Theory of the Internet: that people are online purely to meet each other, and in the long run the venues where we congregate are an unimportant background compared to the interactions themselves.\n - Community builders (a.k.a. dark forests) underestimate how powerful these mainstream channels are; our havens will be minor compared to their immensity.\n\t - Social media like FB, Twitter, etc. won't go away.\n\t -  ==The meaning and tone of these platforms changes with who uses them.== What kind of bowling alley it is depends on who goes there.\n\t\t -  Related notes:\n\t\t\t -  [[Cards/context collapse]]\n\t\t\t -  [[Cards/Everyone always acts in accordance with their internal narratives]]\n\t - If a significant portion of the population leaves these spaces, it will also leave people left to influence, and limit the influence of those who left. This might make the dark forest more dangerous. Do you really want to give power to those in the dark?\n\u003e And those of us building dark forests risk underestimating how powerful the mainstream channels will continue to be, and how minor our havens are compared to their immensity.\n\u003e The influence of Facebook, Twitter, and others is enormous and not going away. There‚Äôs a reason why Russian military focused on these platforms when they wanted to manipulate public opinion: they have a real impact. The meaning and tone of these platforms changes with who uses them. What kind of bowling alley it is depends on who goes there.\n\u003e  Should a significant percentage of the population abandon these spaces, that will leave nearly as many eyeballs for those who are left to influence, and limit the influence of those who departed on the larger world they still live in.\n\u003e  If the dark forest isn‚Äôt dangerous already, these departures might ensure it will be.\n### Beyond the Dark Forest  Theory of the Internet\n- The Internet is no longer experimental, it's stakes have gone too high.\n\t- Now, the internet is emotionally, reputationally, and physically dangerous. It has become the dark forest.\n\t\t- E.G. Bullying, shaming, swatting\n\t- Our digital breadcrumbs can be used as evidence against us.\n\t- Because of this, we stay silent, and moved underground. For our safety.\n\u003e  The internet went from a venue for low stakes experimentation to the place with some of the highest stakes of all. With the rise of online bullying, shaming (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00L9B7IRC/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8\u0026btkr=1), and swatting (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swatting), the internet became emotionally, reputationally, and physically dangerous. It became the dark forest. Our digital breadcrumbs became evidence that could and would be used against us. To keep safe we exercised our right to stay silent and moved underground.\n- Back to Ciuxin's [[Cards/The Three Body Problem]]. A solution for this dark forest: creating a ==\"black domain\".==\n\t-  A black domain stops everything from getting in or out.

They're not too off-grid. We're not that hardcore.\n\t- But we're more like black domains than we care to admit, especially when it comes to ==showing our true selves online.==\n\u003e  In The Three Body Problem series, author Liu Cixin presents a solution for the dark forest threat: a ‚Äúblack domain.‚Äù This device slows the speed of light to create a cloak of invisibility around a planet or galaxy. A black domain stops everything from getting in or out. It‚Äôs security through cosmic self-imprisonment.\n\u003e  Dark forests like email lists and Slack groups are more forgiving than Liu‚Äôs black domains. They‚Äôre off-grid, but they aren‚Äôt that off-grid. Today‚Äôs black domain equivalents might be things like putting phones in freezers (https://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/25/why-snowdens-visitors-put-their-phones-in-the-fridge/), Mastodon (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastodon_(software)), and crypto cold storage (https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Cold_storage). Not many of us are that hardcore with our digital habits yet. But when it comes to showing our true selves online, many of us are more like black domains than we care to admit.\n - If there's ==little connection/influence to the outside world,== dark forests can turn into black domains.\n\t - How can we make change for the better if we stay in these forests? In order to improve the communities and cultures we're part of, we have to ==actively engage== with them.\n\t -  What kind of influence does that mean I really have? What kind of influence does that mean each of us has? And who fills that vacuum if we fail to fill it ourselves?\n \u003e  Our dark forests can become black domains, with little connection to or influence on the outside world.\n \u003e We can‚Äôt lurk in the dark forests and expect anything to change for the better. To improve and positively contribute to the communities and cultures we‚Äôre a part of, we have to actively engage.\n \u003e Here I was retreating from the web because I thought my online presence was unimportant and inconsequential. Meanwhile, a foreign power was using its resources to pretend to be someone like me to try to influence someone like me. What kind of influence does that mean I really have?

To find two axes that have been overlooked. To build a story, a true story, that keeps your promise, that puts you in a position where you are the clear and obvious choice.\n   \n   \u003eThe alternative is to find and build and earn your story, the arc of the change you seek to produce.\n- Marketing can be a form of ==generosity.==\n \u003eMarketing acts (interesting choice of word, acts) are the generous actions of people who care.\n- [[Cards/We serve others through our emotional labor]].\n\u003e Emotional labor is the work we do to provide service.\n- All you need to create a touching piece is work with the ==basic set of human dreams and desires.==\n\u003eThis core basket of dreams and desires means that marketers, like artists, don‚Äôt need many colors to paint an original masterpiece.\n- To ==succeed== in the macro, you need to in the ==micro.==\n\u003eIf you can‚Äôt succeed in the small, why do you believe you will succeed in the large?\n- [[Cards/Everyone always acts in accordance with their internal narratives]].\n- [[Cards/Marketers make change]].\n \u003eMarketers don‚Äôt make average stuff for average people. Marketers make change. And they do it by normalizing new behaviors.\n\n  \u003eLazy marketers try to buy enrollment with flashy ads. The best marketers earn enrollment by seeking people who want the change being offered. And they do it by connecting people to others who want the change as well. And that change is precisely what marketers seek.\n- To change a huge culture, start first with a ==small group.==\n\t\u003eIn order to change a culture, we begin with an exclusive cohort. That‚Äôs where we can offer the most tension and create the most useful connections.\n- [[Cards/The purpose of capitalism is to build our culture]].\n \u003eThe purpose of our culture isn‚Äôt to enable capitalism, even capitalism that pays your bills. The purpose of capitalism is to build our culture.\n- A marketing asset (i.e. a brand) is made up of ==connection== \u0026 ==everything non-quantifiable.==\n \u003e If you want to build a marketing asset, you need to invest in connection and other nontransferable properties. If people care, you‚Äôve got a brand.\n- Without a brand, a logo is ==meaningless.==\n\u003eIf a brand is our mental shorthand for the promise that you make, then a logo is the Post-it reminder of that promise.

Pricing changes your marketing.\n- We ==can't make a living== if we give all our ideas away.\n\u003eWe don‚Äôt know how to make a living if we give everything away. The road out of this paradox is to combine two offerings, married to each other: Free ideas that spread. Expensive expressions of those ideas that are worth paying for.\n- Your stories ==can't be made for everyone.==\n\t- That story isn‚Äôt for everyone, but for the right people, it transforms the experience. Who‚Äôs it for, what‚Äôs it for, and how is status changed?

Too expensive, too slow. To find individuals, interrupt them, and enroll them, one by one¬†.¬†.¬†. it‚Äôs a daunting task. The alternative is to intentionally create a product or service that people decide is worth talking about. I call this a Purple Cow.\n- Don't aim for breaking big on social media; start small with a [[Cards/Minimum viable audience]].\n\u003eThe goal isn‚Äôt to maximize your social media numbers. The goal is to be known to the smallest viable audience.\n- To target the [[Cards/long tail]], you must create something ==extraordinary== for the market that ==connects== with them. This shows them that you're in the [[Cards/short head]].\n \u003eThis means that living on the long tail has two essential elements: Creates the definitive, the most essential, the extraordinary contribution to the field. Connects the market you‚Äôve designed it for, and helps them see that you belong in the short head. That this hit is the glue that holds them together.\n- You don't get discovered through the Internet alone, but through the ==impact you make uniting the people you serve.==\n \u003eYes, the internet is a discovery tool. But no, you‚Äôre not going to get discovered that way. Instead, you will make your impact by uniting those you seek to serve.\n- ==Build new things for your customers== instead of finding new customers for your things.\n \u003econsider focusing on which steps to shift or eliminate. Explore what happens if people engage in your ideas or your community before you ask them to send you money. Invest in the lifetime value of a customer, building new things for your customers instead of racing around trying to find new customers for your things.\n- The market consists of many short heads and many long tails.\n\u003e by dividing the market into many curves, not just one, we end up with many short heads and many long tails.\n- The narrative for ==action== consists of the story of ==self==, the story of ==us==, and the story of ==now==.\n\u003eHe has articulated a simple three-step narrative for action: the story of self, the story of us, and the story of now.\n","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.735605378Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Literature-Notes/This-is-Water-Literature-Notes":{"title":"This is Water - Literature Notes","content":"## Notes\nSee [[Sources/This is Water - Speech]]\n#literaturenotes \n- We're hard-wired to believe hat we're the ==centre of the universe==\n  \u003eeverything in my own immediate experience supports my deep belief that I am the absolute centre of the universe; the realest, most vivid and important person in existence. We rarely think about this sort of natural, basic self-centredness because it‚Äôs so socially repulsive. But it‚Äôs pretty much the same for all of us. It is our default setting, hard-wired into our boards at birth.\n- Learning ==how to think== consists of learning how to ==control== what we pay ==attention== to + how we construct ==meaning== from experience\n  \u003elearning how to think really means learning how to exercise some control over how and what you think. It means being conscious and aware enough to choose what you pay attention to and to choose how you construct meaning from experience. Because if you cannot exercise this kind of choice in adult life, you will be totally hosed. Think of the old clich√© about ‚Äúthe mind being an excellent servant but a terrible master.‚Äù\n- It's within our power to see ==excruciating== experiences as ==meaningful== ones\n  \u003eIf you‚Äôre automatically sure that you know what reality is, and you are operating on your default setting, then you, like me, probably won‚Äôt consider possibilities that aren‚Äôt annoying and miserable.

It will actually be within your power to experience a crowded, hot, slow, consumer-hell type situation as not only meaningful, but sacred, on fire with the same force that made the stars: love, fellowship, the mystical oneness of all things deep down.\n- [[Cards/Everybody gets to choose what they worship]]\n  \u003ein the day-to-day trenches of adult life, there is actually no such thing as atheism. There is no such thing as not worshipping. Everybody worships. The only choice we get is what to worship. And the compelling reason for maybe choosing some sort of god or spiritual-type thing to worship‚Äìbe it JC or Allah, be it YHWH or the Wiccan Mother Goddess, or the Four Noble Truths, or some inviolable set of ethical principles‚Äìis that pretty much anything else you worship will eat you alive.\n- ==True freedom== requires attention, awareness, and discipline, in order to care and sacrifice for others everyday.\n \u003e The really important kind of freedom involves attention and awareness and discipline, and being able truly to care about other people and to sacrifice for them over and over in myriad petty, unsexy ways every day.\n- [[Cards/The alternative to freedom is unconsciousness]]\n  \u003e That is real freedom. That is being educated, and understanding how to think.

Technology companies stood by, ready to become everyone‚Äôs library, memory, personality.\n- The tech industry creates ==consumers== of its leisure and work culture.\n   \u003e The tech industry was making me a perfect consumer of the world it was creating. It wasn‚Äôt just about leisure, the easy access to nice food and private transportation and abundant personal entertainment. It was the work culture, too: what Silicon Valley got right, how it felt to be there. The energy of being surrounded by people who so easily articulated, and satisfied, their desires. The feeling that everything was just within reach.\n- ==Homogeneity== is the cost of erasing ==decision fatigue.==\n    \u003e Homogeneity was a small price to pay for the erasure of decision fatigue. It liberated our minds to pursue other endeavors, like work.\n- The psychic burden all tech workers share: ==all software is vulnerable to erasure.==\n   \u003e sometimes wondered whether there was a unique psychic burden shared by people who worked in technology, specifically those of us building and supporting software that existed only in the cloud. The abstractions of knowledge work were well documented, but this felt new. It was not just the cognitive dissonance of how lucrative and powerful tech companies had become, when their tools did not physically exist, but that all software was vulnerable, at any time, to erasure.\n- Technologists' excitement about ==urbanism== reflects how they're slowly settling into ==political power.==\n    \u003e What I didn‚Äôt realize was that technologists‚Äô excitement about urbanism wasn‚Äôt just an enthusiasm for cities, or for building large-scale systems, though these interests were sincere.

Currently, most of the models are trained from v1.4 or v1.5. They are trained with additional data for generating images of particular styles or objects.\n\t- There are two ways of training models: [[Dreambooth]] and [[Cards/Embedding]]\n- [[Cards/LoRa Models]] make image generation more efficient by encapsulating training parameters into one model keyword (e.g. \u003clora:lydia-08:1\u003e) \n\t- You can start making the dataset of your first LoRa model by generating images from SD\n\t- This is how you can start working towards [datasets as imagination](https://joinreboot.org/p/artist-datasets)\n- [[Cards/ControlNet]] gives you finetuning power over your images\n- [[Variable Auto Encoder]] is a file you use in addition to your Stable Diffusion checkpoint models to get more vibrant colors and crisper images. \n\t- They hep with improving hands and faces.\n- Notes\n\t- You may have to subscribe to Pencilcase or Rundiffusion for more memory...\n\t- For resources: go to https://civitai.com/ for models to use.

I also carried out a content analysis of official platforms related to RTH, such as the official websites and companies within the ecosystem\n\t- These published outputs provided accurate and precise details on the innovation initiative, such as the positioning of the actors involved in the development of the tech hub. They underscore the imaginaries by which their proponents envisaged the world and are, therefore, key tools in materialising their visions of desirable futures. This wide array of data sources enabled sufficient data triangulation to develop credible and compelling narratives and to achieve conceptual validity.\n- ","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.735605378Z","tags":null},"/Sources/13-Principles-of-Web3-Thread":{"title":"13 Principles of Web3 - Thread","content":"## Information\n- **Source:** [[David Phelps]]; https://twitter.com/divine_economy/status/1454218925483384834\n- **Tags:** #web3 \n- **Notes:** \n\n## Highlights\n**Web 3 can transform everyday instutions.

He was entrusted with the production and protection of Egypt's gold. So carved into the walls of his tomb are depictions of his invaluable work...particularly **the entire gold-making process**\n\t\t- 1st step: weighing of gold\n\t\t\t- Even if gold was abundant, it was still valuable to the point that nothing was unaccounted for\n\t\t- Remarkable hieroglyphs:\n\t\t\t- A master telling his slave to get his ass moving\n\t\t\t- All four goldsmiths are ==dwarfs==; dwarfs are depicted as gold workers because they were actually perceived by ancient Egyptians as possessing ==magical powers.==\n- Most of the gold smiths' creations were hidden away from view and/or stolen...until **archaeologist Howard Carter** came along. He broke into the tomb of **Tutankhamen** and found all his treasures\n\t- The most astounding treasure found here was the death mask of Tutankhamen: 11kg solid gold, bejwelled, exquisitely crafted.\n\t\t- Tender: big ears, fleshy lips, wide innocent eyes to make the face come to life\n\t- Why was everything in gold? This isn't a statement of wealth...rather it shows how people believed that **gold had magical powers**\n\t\t- Same color as the sun; never tarnishes\n\t\t- Perhaps Tut was hoping the magic would rub off on him\n### Rome\n- Pagan gods were banished and replaced with a single creator -- the Christian God. This is all thanks to Emperor Constantine\n\t- The one new idea of Christianity: **distaste for wealth, extravagance, ostentatious display**\n\t- This led to gold, a modern luxury, no longer being worshipped\n- But gold made a comeback thanks to a new artform: **Byzantine art**\n\t- Why was gold deemed appropriate in this context? Here, it represents not material things, but ==immaterial things.== Perhaps it's suited to portray God, the most immaterial of them all\n\t- The backgrounds of icons are generally gold. They represent the ==all-pervading presence of God.== It reflects light, it gives light. It's radiant with God.\n\t\t- The reflective qualities of light show how a life with God is dynamic, not static. Color is transformed from murky brown to shimmering yellow\n\t\t- Gold became the color of the light of God\n- In the 6th century AD, **Byzantine Emperor Justinian** built the **basilica** of **San Vitale** in Ravenna\n\t- Showcases one of the greatest inventions of the Byzantine age: **gold tesseras.** These are individual tiles (often squares) that are used to ==create mosaics.==\n\t- They trap all of the light in this church, and then the glass like a lens amplifies that light.\n\t\t- The light is not blinding like electricity; it sparkles, glimmers, and glistens\n\t\t- Must've felt like looking into heaven\n- The early Christians who had once renounced all things golden, had, like the ancients before them, used the colour ingeniously to bring themselves closer to their God.\n### Renaissance\n- Heaven seemed to lose its monopoly on gold...and gold would become a potent force in more ==worldly affairs.==\n- Now gold was used to satisfy the vanity of kings, queens, and their courts\n\t- E.G. **Queen Elizabeth I** giving out **solid gold cameos** with her face to her most trusted courtiers\n- So while it's gold, it's no longer really about the sacred. What it's really about is **power, politics and, above all, status.**\n\t- Kings and queens looked for the best goldsmiths to outshine their rivals\n- **Ponte Vecchio in Florence:** one of the great centres of gold work. People would sell their wares here. But the goldsmith most sought after was **Benvenuto Cellini.**\n\t- the only goldsmith to get a statue.\n\t- Cellini was fastidious in recording his many ingenious techniques\n\t- Cellini's legacy lives on at the studio of **Paolo Penko**, a Florentine goldsmith who's been following Cellini ever since he was little\n\t- Cellini was a troublemaker; he was charged with various crimes. But **King Francis I of France** was willing to forgive him of everything in order to make his kingdom the center of the renaissance\n\t\t- He commissioned Cellini to make a solid gold salt cellar. Cellini ended up taking over 3 years on this project, but it became the masterpiece that defined his career\n\t\t\t- 2 gods: Neptune (sea) and Terra (land)\n\t\t\t- Salt was an incredibly important substance in the 16th century (made up much of King Francis' revenue), which is why it was worth putting in gold\n- **Augustus the Strong** was a ruler whose lust for gold was so strong...he would've stolen this cellar\n\t- Favorite sport: fox tossing\n\t- Depicted in a statue known as The Golden Rider\n\t- His desire was to be seen as one of the great rulers of European history, and the secret to achieving that ambition was gold.\n\t- He had a dream of unlimited gold...which led him to **Friedrich Bottger**, a 19-year-old alchemist who seemingly achieved the miracle of transmutation,\n\t\t- Freidrich was imprisoned by Augustus. He couldn't produce gold, of course...but he was able to produce a ==golden sun mask==, which was modelled on Augustus' features\n\t\t- It was made of copper, with a bit of gold put on top of it\n\t\t\t- It embodies that desperate desire of Augustus to enter the pantheon of the great gods and the great kings, but also shows how he wasn't powerful and rich enough to become one of them\n- **George Richards Elkington** was a step closer to this dream though...he patented a way to make gold objects out of almost nothing. This was a process called **electro-plating:** ==harnessing electricity to make gold objects.==\n\t- Prince Albert visited and was captivated by this...he then asked to have his own electro-plating suite\n\t- People liked electro-plating because it was cheap. It doesn't really produce solid gold. All it does is produce a color. Hence why it can be called ==Elkington's fool's gold==\n\t- This innovation allowed the public to own their very own piece of gold, even if it wasn't pure. ==It democratized gold==\n- **Gustav Klimt's** The Kiss\n\t- almost every single kind of golden substance was thrown on this canvas (e.g. eight different kinds of gold leaf alone)\n\t- Why so much gold? This could be seen as part of his desperate attempt to ==bring back gold from the brink. ==\n\t\t- He has lived through a period when gold has become debased, cheap, and tacky (thanks to democratization)\n\t\t- He's trying to say, \"No, gold is the most precious thing we have. It's the most numinous, spiritual, other-worldly thing we have and therefore we have to devote it to the most important things in the world\"...which was **love**\n\t\t- Ironic how his work has been endlessly reproduced now\n\n## Cues\n- Magic\n\t- Dwarfs\n\t- Sun god\n\t- Doesn't tarnish\n- Material -\u003e immaterial\n- Light of God\n- Tessera\n- Sacred -\u003e worldly\n- Transmutation\n- Electro-plating\n- Elkington's fool's gold\n\n## Summary\n- We're so obsessed with gold because gold reflects the things that every society holds **most sacred.**\n\t- Ancient Egyptians: the sun and the afterlife\n\t- The Christians: the light of God\n\t- The Renaissance Kings: power and status\n\t- Gustav Klimt: love and sex\n\t- Bank of England: money","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.735605378Z","tags":null},"/Sources/A-Pig-Was-Once-Killed-in-Our-Garage-Book":{"title":"A Pig Was Once Killed in Our Garage - Book","content":"## Information\n- **Source:** [[Martin Villanueva]]\n- **Tags:** #essays \n- **Notes:** [[A Pig Was Once Killed in Our Garage (Literature Notes)]]\n## Highlights\n\u003e ‚ÄúWhat I write here is not my teaching, but my study; it is not a lesson for others, but for me.‚Äù - Michel de Montaigne, ‚ÄúOf Practice‚Äù\n### Of Lists\n- The Infinity of Lists, Umberto Eco\n- two ways to view the world: finite form and open-endedness of lists\n- these are both central to the literary experience\n\u003e there is one which privileges the finite form, within which lies an entire cosmos; and there is another which performs an appreciation for what we harbor no illusion of being able to contain.\n### 4.\n\u003e Here I was thinking that writing was about finding inherent orders, connecting plot points that naturally lead to agreeable insights.

An archaeology of design is an archaeology of curiousity.\n\n### 1. The Mirror of Design\n\n\u003e Design always presents itself as serving the human but its real ambition is to redesign the human. \n\n\u003e The history of design is therefore a history of evolving conceptions of the human. To talk about design is to talk about the state of our species.\n\n\u003e We literally live inside design...design has become the world.\n\n\u003e To think about design demands an archaeological approach. You have to dig...Digging, documenting, dissecting, discussing -- digging, that is, into ourselves.\n\n\u003e [Archaeology] is a kind of reverse engineering of design.\n\n\u003e Design is a form of projection, to shape something rather than to find it, to invent something and think about the possible outcomes of that invention.\n\n\u003e The human might be the only species to have systematically designed its own extinction, and seems to be getting close to accomplishing the goal.\n\n\u003e Our self-image is multiple and ever-shifting, as if we look into a vast multifaceted mirror in which the surfaces keep moving.\n\n\u003e The ability to see so much more is equally the ability to be seen much more...Self-monitoring is a huge part of human activity -- and is insperable from design.\n\n\u003e Artifacts become truly transformative by exceeding what was expected of them, exceeding our grasp. It is precisely in challenging us -- triggering the potential of new ways of seeing, thinking, grasping, and acting -- that design plays its role in redefining the human.\n\n\n### 2. The Plastic Human\n\n\u003e Human is an unstable category, even an unstable being...it is defined by its diversity and plasticity -- its ability to modify its own abilities...it is this plasticity that is the basis of its massive impact...in redesigning itself, it redesigns the planet.\n\n\u003e What makes the human human is...in our interdependency with artifacts...the human is insperable from the artifacts that it produces...the human emerges in the redefinition of capacity provided by the artifacts. In a sense, the artifacts are more human than the human.\n\n\u003e Artifacts are therefore never simply the representstives of human intentions and abilities. They are also openings, possibilities of something new in the human, even a new human. There is always a gap between intentions and what is produced. The artifact offers something unexpected, some additional quality or resistance. This excess opens up new ways of thinking, new modes of design.\n\n\u003e ...histories of the human are histories of artifacts and the interactivities between artifacts, seen as potentials rather than accomplishments, as if the Earth is a vast design studio in which human capacity is being tinkered with in unexpected ways.\n\n\u003e Artifacts are interfaces, enabling different forms of human engagement with the world but equally enabling the world to engage with the human differently.\n\n\u003e The archaeology of design is...the history of a question mark.\n\n### 3. Blows of Design\n\u003e The objects were not just made, they were thought...they are human artifacts because the regularity of the shape \"surely implies design, the application of forethought, and an intelligent purpose.\" The physical implement is first and foremost an instrument of thought.\n\n+ We're older than we think...and more intelligent too.... we challenged religious notions by discovering  prehistory\n+ Charles Darwin: \"unity of design\" is not because of divine intelligence, but because it is a product of the essential mutability of all species\n\t+ Countless incremental adaptations increase the chances of survival in changing environments\n\n\u003e Natural selection is design without a designer.\n\n\u003e The human hand is uniquely adapted to make and use tools. The inherited structure of the body ultimately altered by its technological extensions...human designs eventually redesign the human. We are gradually redesigned by our tools.\n\n\u003e The sustained attempt to develop and promote a concept of \"design\" in everyday objects as a necessary response to the massive impact of industrialization on human life was made during the dramatic encounter with the design of the very first tools and with a destabilizing sense of intimacy with apes and the extended organic world.\n\n\u003e Design itself was understood as the very principle of human evolution in an uncritical celebration of progress -- as if nothing was more human than the ability to modernize oneself.\n\n\u003e The concept of modern design...was part of the ongoing testing of [established concepts of human biological and technological evolution].\n\n\u003e In the end, the design of the earliest tools might be as much about their ornamental beauty as about defined function, visually striking designs to help the survival of the craftsperson's genes by attracting mates.\n\n\u003e If design is the first sign of the human, it is the beginning of a permanent question.\n\n### 4. The Invention of the Human\n\u003e The human becomes human in seeing itself in the things it makes, or seeing its possibility in those things. So the human doesn't simply invent tools. Tools invent the human. More precisely, tool and human produce each other. The artifacts that prosthetically expand thought and reach are what make the human human.\n\n\u003e The body itself is only human by virtue of technology: \"the human hand is human because of what it makes, not of what it is.\"\n\n\u003e The human brain is therefore an effect of new tools rather than the generator of new tools.\n\n\u003e ...a tool is not produced to carry out a defined utilitarian task. Tools are born as challenges to existing concepts of utility. They open up new understandings of what could be useful. Utility is not a given unambiguous need. Ambiguity about utility is what drives new forms of utility.\n\n\u003e ...the main driver of human accomplishment is simply a unique human capacity for variability, an impulse to generate a multiciplity of ways to do things in reaction to different cirumstances...this variability itself can be understood as design capacity...Humans continuously imagine different ways even in the same context, to the point of malfunction.\n\n\u003e The human brain itself is a malleable artifact whose circuits are continually rearranged through engagement with material culture. It is an unfinished project with a forever uncertain future and an equally uncertain beginning.\n\n\u003e Design is by definition unevenly distributed in space and time, often flickering as some innovations disappear for a very long time only to be reinvented again.\n\n\u003e The human is permanently suspended between being the cause and effect, between designing living things and being designed by them.\n\n\u003e What is human in the end is neither the designer nor the artifacts but their interdependency.\n\n### 5. The Ornamental Species\n\u003e The symptoms of recognizably human behavior were the sophistication and complexity of tools, symbols, rituals, and techniques. Even then, this acceleration only became exponential in the last 12,000 years, when \"humans redesigned themselves as organic beings,\" as John Hoffecker puts it, with abstract thinking, composite tools, long-distane networks of production and exchange, cooperative labor, and so on. Countless inventions steadily transformed the species and dramatically altered its relationship to the environment through the \"domestication (that is, *re*designing) of plants and animals.\"\n\n\u003e Ornaments are a key symptom of the human ability to externalize its thoughts in symbolic form -- generating and sharing information rather than simply processing it.\n\n\u003e Ornament both marks and expands the human. It is both a sign of the ability to invent and the very mechanism of invention.\n\n\u003e Ornament...is both a tool of communication and the opening to new forms of tool...\n\n\u003e The human is that species that keeps reflecting on the possible uses of its artifacts and communicating these reflections by making new artifacts, flickering back and forth between ornament and tool.\n\n\u003e ...this multiplicity and malleability...is evidence of the capacity to invent that makes us human, that invents the human even.\n\n\u003e ...what is seen as ornament is doing the real work and what looks like a tool is really for show. And the vibration between them is the very engine of design.\n\n\u003e Design routinely constructs digital inequalities...it is everywhere, and it engineers concentrations of wealth and privilege.\n\n### 6.

But in the end, he also gives us hope for an alternative way  of living which can leads us closer to being in touch with our true selves. In Christian parlance, this is what we call **being the beloved of God.**\n\n**[\"Being the Beloved\" (FULL SERMON Part One) | Henri Nouwen at the Crystal Cathedral](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trG7Oh_PopM)**\n- The core of that faith belongs to my conviction that you and I and are the beloved daughters and sons of God.\n- One of the enormous spiritual tasks we have is to claim that and to live a life based on that knowledge.\n- Most of us fail constantly to claim the truth of who we are.\n- The question for you and me: who are we? That's the question that keeps us going; for our whole lives, we try to answer that question: \"Who am I?\"\n  - The first answer we live with: \"I am what I do\"\n  - Second answer: \"I am what other people say about me\"\n  - Third answer: \"I am what i have\"\n- When you live this kind of life, with all these ups and downs, the end is death. When you are dead, you're dead.\n  - Nobody talks about you anymore. You don't have anything anymore. You can't do anything anymore.\n  - You lose it all and that little life of you and of mine ends up into nothing.\n- ^ This whole thing is wrong. That is not who you are, and that is not who I am.\n  - Jesus says that's a lie. That's the greatest lie that makes you and me enter into relationships of violence and destruction. Because I know who I am.\n- Jesus heard that voice: \"You are my beloved. You are my favorite.\" and it was that voice that he clung to as he lived his life.\n  - Jesus held on to the truth: whatever happens, I am the beloved of God and that is who I am. And that allows me to live in a world that keeps rejecting me, or praising me, or laughing at me, or spitting on me.\n- We too can cling to this truth. I am the beloved not because people say i'm great, but because I am the beloved even before I was born.\n  - When you accept this, your life will become more and more the lifeof the beloved because that's who you are\n  - You start discovering that all that you do here is nurtured from the knowledge that you are the beloved. That's who you are.\n- When you start believing this, that circle of knowledge will go become bigger and bigger and bigger until it cuts right into your daily life.\n  - You will still have rejections. You will still have praise. And you will still have losses. But you live no longer as a person searching for his/her identity, but you will live it as the beloved.\n  - You will love your pain and you will live your anguish and you will live your successes and you will live your failures as the one who knows who you are.\n- The voice that calls you the beloved is the voice of the first love.\n  - John writes: love one another because God has loved you first\n  - The great struggle is to claim that first love.\n- Hard truth: The people who love us do not always love us well. \n  - How can we live this truth: that in this world, love and wounds are never separated?\n  - We can only live it when we always reclaim that first love. So that we can forgive those who love us poorly, but also so that we can recognize in the love that we do receive a hint or a glimpse of that first love.\n- If I can hold on to that (this first love) and live in the world, then I can be free to love other people without expecting them to give me all that my heartfelt desires, because God has created you and me with a heart that only God's love can satisfy.\n  - If we are willing to let the pain not make us bitter, but prune us to give us a deeper sense of our belovedness, then we can be free as Jesus and walk on this world and proclaim God's first love wherever we go.\n\n### Summary\n#### Tangibles\nWe tend to answer the question **Who Am I?** in 3 ways:\n1.

The crude caricature is \"smash your smart phone and go live in a log cabin to reclaim your attention and your life from being hacked by evil social media platforms.\"\n- retreating from information flows is just a ==different way of having your attention hacked by others.==\n- If FOMO, Fear Of Missing Out, is the basic fear exploited by third parties that want to drown you in information, the basic fear exploited by people telling you to unplug and retreat is ==FOBO: Fear Of Being Ordinary.==\n![[Extras/Media/Images/Attention Management Turnpike.png]]\n- Premise: ==FOMO is good.== Being plugged in is good. There is valuable info at all levels from twitter gossip to philosophy books. You should stay plugged in.\n-  Inspiration from 2 sources: The famous quote ==\"small minds discuss people, average minds discuss events, great minds discuss ideas\"== ( = y axis) and Richard Hamming's idea of scheduling ==\"Great Thoughts\"== calendar time in You and Your Research\n![[Extras/Media/Images/Great Thoughts.png]]\n-  you are part of a ==Giant Social Computer in the Cloud (GSCITC)== computing the future. ==The level and latency at which you consume information and act on it determines your \"job\" in the social computer.== Your shitposting and FOMO are functional.\n-  If you don't manage your information economy career, you will default to the lowest-level job in the social computer: ==processing very low-latency information with small-minded cognition (bottom left) for small bets.== It's the equivalent of low-level bug reporting/testing.\n-  The way to manage your attention is to ==be sensitive to your current mind size (small to great)== and ==consciously target the zone you want to be in,== moving fluidly between small/great mind.\n-  There are ==THREE ways to fail== at this: a) Thinking you can be Great Minded all the time. b) Trying to be Great Minded purely on a low-latency information diet (upper-left red box) c) Trying to consume a high-latency information diet without aspiring to more than small-minded thoughts (lower-right red box)\n-  The first failure mode manifests as trying to consume only information at your target level. This will fail. ==You need some information diet input from ALL levels to work at ANY level==\n-  The second failure mode manifests as ==trying to have Great Thoughts on a diet of pure low-latency live information== (upper-left red box).\n-  The final failure mode is trying to ==keep up with all the information at all latencies at a small-minded level== (lower-right red box).\n-  Each failure mode is an information diet that leads to patterns of betting that fail to deliver a positive return long-term. It's not addictive FOMOing that kills you, but ==not being able to translate the information consumption/production choices you're making into winning bets.==\n-  Higher latency requires ==higher abstraction levels/bigger minds== to extract value.\n-  ==Trying to \"float\" your attention at a focused point on the turnpike== rather than distributing attention all along it is the other way to ==fail==\n-  The danger in executing this turnpike roadmap strategy is that ==your mind-level might choose you rather than you choosing your mind-level.==\n-  This is a bit like ==weight training.== You have to increase the weights slowly and perhaps ==train your attention to exhaustion== a bit. If you're in small mind zone and can only consume/produce tweets, try an essay. See how far you get. Strength-train attention from 10s to 10min. You can and should go the other way as well. If you can only read big philosophy books by dead people and processing the chaotic churn of a Toxic Day on Twitter is too much for you, try handling it for 15 minutes, then an hour. Try posting instead of just reading. This is like ==low-weights/high-volume endurance training.== Harder than it looks.\n-  this ==atrophying of attention and latency limits== will happen REGARDLESS of whether evil designers are trying to hack your attention and keep you phase-locked into their preferred 10s latency information loop. ==Their designs are in fact the LOAD you're training against==\n-  information distribution has become free/cheap, so the firehose is going to have flows at all timescales, time constants, and abstraction levels no matter what designers and advertisers want or don't want. ==It's the information firehose itself that's creating this environment not evil designers.==\n-  ==the original attention hack: powerful religious leaders== telling smart people to check out and unplug from information flows. That way, they get the power\n-  This game is based on the opposite fear to FOMO which I call FOBO. If FOMO is Fear of Missing Out, FOBO is Fear Of Being Ordinary.\n-  When you are plugged into the GSCITC, ==you are part of a great computational fluidization of human cognition.== You're just ==one instance== in a liquid cloud of human intelligence, your thoughts entangled with those of others in a giant ongoing computation.\n-  This fluidization is a different emergent social phenomenon from the homogenization achieved by Organization Man corporations. ==Instead of being a faceless interchangeable part, you are a unique entangled particle in a quantum soup.==\n-  The cost though is that even if your contributions are unique and your personal payoff makes it worthwhile if you do it right, ==the one thing the liquid cloud can't offer you is individual recognition.==\n-  The GSCITC is not a homogenizer of effort or imagination, but ==it IS a homogenizer of egos and identities. ==What you do counts. Who you are doesn't. You are an ordinary part of an extraordinary process.\n-  This is the heart of FOBO. Fear of Being Ordinary. ==Fear of being just another entangled particle in the GSCITC.== Fear of your ego dissolving into the collective ego. Fear of having \"nothing to show\" for playing a part, despite it being sustainable.\n-  Waldenponding, I strongly suspect, is ==driven more by FOBO and ego-attachment== than by any real fear of having your mind, productive potential, and rewards destroyed by \"hacked attention.\"\n-  A real adept oughta be able to meditate on the angriest, most toxic twitter stream, consume the bile, and turn it into nectar: ==actionable insight you can bet on in the real world.==\n-  ==A real adept ought to have strength-trained attention== so they can spend an hour either reading a tweetstream or a once-in-a-generation history-disrupting philosophy book.\n-  We are all now part of a powerful global social computer in the cloud that is possibly ==the only mechanism we have available to tackle the big problems of the world that industrial age mechanisms are failing to cope with.== We might as well get good at it. Do your part. Stay as plugged in as you can.\n\n### Against Waldenponding 2\nhttps://breakingsmart.substack.com/p/against-waldenponding-ii\n- never trust anything that can make its own meaning if you can see where it keeps its soul.\n- \"soul\" loosely as a ==metaphor for meaning-making ability.==\n- Unlike intelligence, a soul (metaphoric or literal) ==isn't supposed to take on such a tangible form factor==\n- Meaning-making entities -- humans, and organizations -- can only be trusted if they don't seem to know for sure where their soul is.\n- Believe it or not, this nebulous philosophical allegory is central to the seemingly mundane question of ==how much time you should be spending staring at the screens of digital devices.== Interestingly though, it is NOT our digital devices that are the untrustworthy horcruxes in this story. ==The true horcruxes are the objects that waldenponders believe are more deserving of your attention: the Walden ponds.==\n- you aren't an NPC -- non-playing/playable character -- in the battle for your own attention. You have tools ranging from ad blockers to cognitive reframes. If you're letting your attention get \"hacked\", it's because you're choosing to. ==If you think the only kind of agency you have is the agency to uncritically withdraw to save your soul, you've been pwned, but it isn't by the tech platforms.==\n- ==Waldenponding = primitivist, fetishistic fear of screens as demonic objects.== A way of relating to digital devices that seems shaped by a fearmongering vision of them as soul-sucking pumps, and their designers as Dark Lords who are far too powerful for you, mere mortal,  to actively resist. Your only reliable weapon, they say, is the off switch.\n- ==demonization of digital devices== -- perfectly ordinary objects governed by the laws of physics and designed by mere humans --  is something like a magic trick, where the magician wants to misdirect your attention. While you're busy worrying about the evil rectangles of light stealing your soul, you are missing the real danger: the horcruxes they are tempting you to create and trust with legibilized, dead bits of your soul.\n- Waldenponding is a search for meaning that is ==circumscribed by the what you might call the spiritual gravity field of an object or behavior held up as ineffably sacred.== The associated literal pattern of religiosity is idolatry. Today, the ==\"idol\"== in question is generally characterized by negative definition as ==\"almost anything other than the profane digital device screen.\"== It can take a variety of forms: the in-person conversation, the board game, the hike in the woods, the session of manual labor, the construction project, the family dinner, the paper book. All are excellent things, to be valued for what they literally are. But as suggested repositories for bits of your soul, they are incredibly dangerous.\n- the loci at the hearts of the narratives are more than mere motifs or synecdoches for larger spiritual quests. They serve as ==physically embodied focal points around which the quests themselves revolve,== like strange attractors. Though the protagonists may, through the narrative, explore the universe in much more expansive ways, you can see where they keep bits of their souls locked down; the zone that keeps drawing them back; the idol that prevents them from wandering too far.\n- Each in its natural form is a perfectly fine thing. ==It is only when transformed into sacralized fragments of \"soul\" that they turn into dangerous Dark Magic objects. Waldenponding is dangerous because it encourages you to do exactly that.== The effect is particularly insidious because it is presented as a way to do the opposite.\n- Horcrux tests: ==do you know where it keeps its brain?== And ==Does it seem to embody a \"soul\" in more tangible form than you'd expect== from our everyday casual-spiritual sense of the term?\n- First horcrux answer: Nope! ==Each object/activity pair is usually portrayed by waldenponders as a client device connected to a vast cloud of inherited cultural intelligence.== And they are right! Each of these objects/behavior is a classic horcrux candidate because it is ==old enough for illegible, unplottable patterns of cultural intelligence to have formed around it. You cannot probe this intelligence, only surrender to it through ceremonial, mythologized behaviors==\n- Second horcrux answer: Yep! Waldenponders talk of these things as tangible embodiments and reliable catalysts of ineffable states of mind. They are ==secular equivalents of temples.==\n- Same tests applied to devices: ==Do you know where it keeps its intelligence? And Is it a legible piece of soul?==\n- Answers: yes (it‚Äôs in ram, data center, etc.) and no (==While there is definitely a soul to digital life, it definitely does not have an exact address or form or a predictable way to find it.== The locus of \"soul\" in digital media is so nebulous, our entire experience of online life is necessarily built around search functions. Every day you must head out and look for a fresh glimpse of it, expecting it in unexpected places.)\n- Organizations can waldenpond too.\n- Technology is about constantly creating new vistas of experience, new unpaved territories for us to explore with cowpaths that then get paved. Some present tougher growth challenges for humans than others, but ==no particular type or generation of technology has a monopoly on soul-destruction, preservation, or enrichment.==\n- ==To live richly is to trust your soul to the universe at large, and the experiences it offers that we build technology to access more of.== The opposite of keeping your soul in a known safe space is constantly looking for signs of it in the ==stream of experiences that constitute life itself,== and ==digital life== is a particularly rich new part of that stream. Our challenge is not to keep returning to a  sense of the sacred in the same predictable place, but to ==keep rediscovering that predictable sense of the sacred in new places.==\n- if you ==consistently approach rather than retreat from the universe,== soul-enriching stuff will dominate.\n- If you waldenpond...then nothing will happen","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.739605357Z","tags":null},"/Sources/Capitalism-in-virtual-worlds-Essay":{"title":"Capitalism in virtual worlds - Essay","content":"## Reference\n- **Source:**\n- **Keywords:** [[Cards/permanent notes]]\n- **Relevant Notes:**  #metaverse #games #web3 #capitalism \n## Notes\n\u003e I quickly realized how much extra features the premium members got that I didn‚Äôt get. I didn‚Äôt know it at the time, but I had experienced ==the social inequality of having to work more time for less pay (through playing the mini-games for in-game currency), while the upper class elite premium members were able to breeze by and purchase their clothing for less with an alternate in-game currency called ‚Äúe-coins.‚Äù==\n\n\u003e In order to climb up the social hierarchy to these games without being a ‚Äúpremium member‚Äù, I spent more hours playing the mini-games, and making a smaller fraction of the in-game currency as a normal free member for each run-through. I was gated from having the power to purchase goods that were reserved for the elite. I saw value in owning those exclusive jpegs to put on my character, and ==I wanted those jpegs in _context_ because I wanted to be a part of _them_.==\n\n\u003e ==Much of this gated access to digital goods reminds me of present day gated online crypto communities.== In [Friends with Benefits](https://www.fwb.help/), a cultural membership-based DAO, you are required to possess set number of tokens to join the community and access the resources within. The value of the community comes from the desire from those outside to be a part of it, and the value is there because of how people place value in it. It‚Äôs like ‚Äúpaying the digital rent‚Äù to invest in a property as a member of the community and selling it off after leaving the community, with the expectation that the token value will grow stronger with the people and network over time.\n\n\u003e On the flip side, my experience in VRChat was much different. In VRChat, you embody a 3D avatar and teleport into 3D worlds that are community-created. There are no classes for digital goods, and anyone can fully express themselves with any avatar available in the community without restriction. My first experience felt unusual because I wasn‚Äôt used to everything being ungated and free for use. **I realized I had become used to ==better digital goods being gated and inaccessible to the public== when I felt weird taking all the digital goods without pay.**\n\n\u003e In the digital world of Discord servers, DAOs, and VRChat worlds that represent online cities and countries with tokens or in-game currency as the currency of virtual nation-communities, I==‚Äôm constantly reminded that we need not carry the same mistakes of the real world into the digital world. ==Instead, I‚Äôm curious on what a model that would not be a repeat of hyper-capitalism would look like. It didn‚Äôt take understanding a capitalistic system fully to feel insecure about inequality in my childhood MMOs. I‚Äôm continually learning the economics of what the future of organization might look like, and am hopeful that there is a balance between keeping a community in check and in creating inclusion.","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.739605357Z","tags":null},"/Sources/Check-Your-Pulse-Newsletter":{"title":"Check Your Pulse (Newsletter)","content":"## Information\n- **Source:** [[Sari Azout]]\n- **Tags:** #technology #venturecapital #innovation  \n- **Notes:** [[Miscellaneous Notes/Literature Notes/Check Your Pulse - Literature Notes]]","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.739605357Z","tags":null},"/Sources/Computers-and-Creativity-Thesis":{"title":"Computers and Creativity - Thesis","content":"## Information\n- **Source:** [[Molly Mielke]]; https://www.mollymielke.com/cc#mold\n- **Tags:** #creativity #innovation #technology \n- **Notes:** \n\n## Highlights\n\u003e to foster optimal human innovation, digital creative tools need to be interoperable, moldable, efficient, and community-driven.\n\n\u003e Interoperable, moldable, efficient, and community-driven digital creative tools hold immeasurable potential as ==co-creators with human beings.== Tools of this type would ==lower the barrier to entry== and ==make all users toolmakers and owners== in an expanded definition of technological innovation.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.739605357Z","tags":null},"/Sources/Content-Services-and-Asset-Businesses-in-the-Metaverse-Essay":{"title":"Content, Services, and Asset Businesses in the Metaverse - Essay","content":"## Information\n- **Source:** [[Matthew Ball]]; https://www.matthewball.vc/all/csametaverse\n- **Tags:** #metaverse #content #business \n- **Notes:** \n\n## Highlights\n\n\u003e The Metaverse will also revolutionize categories which, for the most part, have ==avoided disruption throughout the internet era. ==Education is a great example. Technologists have long argued that in-person colleges and trade schools would be fundamentally reconfigured and displaced by remote learning.

Instead, the Metaverse will enable students to learn about the construction of Roman aqueducts by helping to build them. Rather than just reading about physics, children will build [Rube Goldberg machines](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/lesson-plans/create-a-rube-goldberg-machine-in-fortnite-creative) (on Earth, and on Mars), and construct LED screens the size of buildings.

Giving any credence to the following myths could undermine all your growth efforts, so it‚Äôs important to acknowledge them for what they are: unfounded theories.  \n- By rejecting the following myths, what we‚Äôre really doing is reaffirming an actual growth marketing truth: ==Real, lasting growth takes strategy, not luck.==\n\n## Growth hacking\n- Around 2010, a term started to circulate around the startup and marketing worlds: growth hacking. Essentially, growth hacking was the ==tenacious pursuit of business growth==, applying a systematic approach that looked well beyond traditional marketing methods and into product development.\n- For example, Airbnb used growth hacking to register its first users‚Äîwhile validating that it was building something people wanted. How? They made it extremely easy to post an Airbnb listing to Craigslist through a custom integration. If that sounds like an engineering/product project rather than a marketing one, that‚Äôs because it was.\n- That‚Äôs all well and good. But the problem is that the word¬†_hacking_¬†has taken on multiple meanings that can create confusion. We believe it leads people to think there's a single tactic that can 100x your growth overnight, and it's your job as a marketer to go find it. That's a myth.\n- The main reason we think this is worth clarifying is because ==\"tactic hunting\"== contradicts our first guiding principle of growth: ==Focus wins.==\n- Bouncing from hack to hack without establishing repeatable and sustainable practices isn't an effective or enjoyable way to run a business.\n- We don't refer to our work as growth hacking, or ourselves as growth hackers. Beware of those who try to sell you on the idea that a single hack can turn your business into an overnight success. Anyone promising a way of getting significant growth quickly is likely quickly getting rich off you.\n- Instead, we'll teach you how to test ideas quickly, but we'll also set realistic expectations about what kind of growth to expect and how long it will take.¬†\n- This brings us to our next misconception: chasing silver bullets.\n\n## The silver bullet fallacy\n- A \"silver bullet\" is a metaphor for a single activity that will guarantee victory. Similar to growth hacking, the silver bullet fallacy is the idea that ==a single marketing activity or channel will automatically lead to exponential growth.==\n- After running thousands of experiments on every single channel and working with over a thousand startups, we can confidently say that we have yet to see a single example of a silver bullet.\n- Growth is hard. Yes, that's a scary statement. But because growth is hard, you'll gain a competitive advantage when you get it right.\n- Startups that chase silver bullets might get some short-term wins, but growth will likely stop there. They'll lose in the long run unless they take a more thoughtful and strategic approach.\n- Therein lies your opportunity: If you can grow purposefully from the start, then you'll hold a competitive advantage. A solid growth engine doubles as a barrier that keeps your competition from stealing your customers.\n\n## Why startups struggle to grow\n- We've covered why marketing is such a critical component of a startup's success. But the concept of marketing or customer acquisition isn't a secret. So why do marketing problems continue to be a primary reason for startup failure?\n- We have a few possible explanations:\n\t- **Bootstrapped startups simply can't afford top marketing talent.**¬†\n\t\t- The best agencies, consultants, and full-time marketers can easily cost $10-15k/month. \n\t\t- If hiring isn't an option, founders must resort to learning marketing themselves. It can be done. \n\t\t- But it's often a long and risky process. It can take months (if not longer) to sift through the countless articles, blogs, and guides to determine what's high-quality AND relevant to your business. \n\t\t- Then there's the issue that even some of the best materials ==fail to teach you exactly¬†_how to execute._==¬†\n\t\t- They may be useful for pointing you in the right direction, but rarely will you find resources that take you all the way through strategy and step-by-step implementation.\n\t- **It's hard to know what true marketing talent looks like.**¬†\n\t\t- It's not just bootstrapped startups that struggle. Even well-funded companies that can afford top talent often struggle to scale their customer acquisition. \n\t\t- How is that possible? One consistent pattern we've seen is companies ==lacking the internal expertise to identify good marketing talent.== \n\t\t- The truth is that just because an agency or consultant is expensive doesn't mean they actually know what they're doing. It takes having at least some growth knowledge to effectively vet growth talent.\n\t- **Top-tier marketing talent is hard to come by.**¬†\n\t\t- And finally, regardless of funding or even expertise, it's flat out hard to hire top talent because they're in high demand (and they know it). They're either making big-time salaries at later-stage companies, or they're running their own businesses.\n- None of this is meant to scare you into thinking all is doomed. There are amazing agencies and full-time hires out there (and we can help you find them). But we feel it's important to explain all of this because:\n\t- it shows how important it is for founders/startup teams to develop in-house expertise.\n\t- it explains exactly why we built this program.\n\n## Strategy is based on real growth principles, not myths\n- **Our goal is to help you build a strong growth foundation and get results for your company.**\n- By completing the Growth Program Curriculum and executing the projects:\n\t-   You'll have designed, built, and implemented an acquisition strategy that is actively attracting new customers to your startup.\n\t-   You'll have a playbook for adding new acquisition channels and a roadmap for scaling them when the time is right.\n\t-   You'll have the knowledge to thoroughly vet new marketing talent.\n\t-   You'll put your startup on a trajectory that will attract top, in-demand talent.\n\t-   And you'll have the knowledge and toolset to lead your company's growth efforts yourself.","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.739605357Z","tags":null},"/Sources/Demand-Curve/Examples-of-Strong-Branding":{"title":"Examples of Strong Branding","content":"## Headspace\n- Headspace is a mindfulness app with a mission to ‚Äúimprove the health and happiness of the world.‚Äù It does this by offering guided meditations to ease users‚Äô stress.\n- Headspace isn‚Äôt the only meditation app on the market, but it‚Äôs one of the best known. Before apps like Headspace came around, though, ==the practice of meditation wasn‚Äôt very widespread.== If you Googled ‚Äúmeditation,‚Äù you‚Äôd see dramatic silhouettes of yogis and monks in a far-off land.\n- This kind of imagery was a challenge for Headspace: ==people didn‚Äôt feel like they could meditate because it didn‚Äôt fit their lifestyle.==\n- Wanting to make meditation accessible to everyone, Headspace‚Äôs creators needed to reframe meditation to ==make it more relatable.== They accomplished this by defining their branding with three key features:\n\t- **A reassuring and positive brand voice.**¬†Headspace‚Äôs copy avoids using any spiritual jargon or idioms. It‚Äôs to the point, but still maintains a warm and friendly tone by framing itself as ‚Äúyour mind‚Äôs best friend.‚Äù\n\t- **Whimsical animated characters.**¬†To make meditation feel less foreign and unattainable, Headspace developed friendly-looking characters as a part of its brand design. The team‚Äôs product designers wanted these characters to be welcoming and inclusive, so they deliberately made them ambiguous‚Äîneither human nor one specific shape or size. Making them even more relatable, they appear in familiar everyday settings, like bedrooms, grocery stores, and on public transit.\n\t- **Visual metaphors about complex ideas.**¬†Mental health can be a heavy topic. So rather than addressing it and other complex subjects directly, Headspace relies on ==symbolic imagery.== For example, it discusses¬†[dark thoughts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7u5N2MfTNU)¬†by illustrating a few scenarios, but never explicitly naming them, e.g., the thought of keying someone‚Äôs car. These images, shown in Headspace‚Äôs whimsical style, make difficult or intimidating subjects more approachable.\n- Many stereotypes paint meditation as a mystical way to escape from reality for a certain type of person: those who are more spiritual, practice yoga, etc. Headspace flips this script with its warm, friendly, and relatable branding. It shows that anyone can benefit from meditation‚Äîand all it takes is a few minutes with the Headspace app.\n\n## BARK\n- The ecommerce subscription service BarkBox first launched in 2012 as a way to help dog owners pamper their canines with new treats and toys. After becoming wildly successful, it has since expanded to offer other dog-centric products and services under the umbrella BARK, with a mission to ‚Äúmake dogs as happy as they make us.‚Äù\n- There‚Äôs no doubt a large part of BARK‚Äôs success comes from its branding. It‚Äôs ==warm, lighthearted, and goofy==‚Äîfitting traits to describe a company centered around man‚Äôs best friend. Some of the most well-known pet retailers, like Petco and Petsmart, have similarly friendly and casual brand personalities, but unlike BARK, they lack a clear narrative.¬†\n- This is where BARK excels. Consider its flagship product, BarkBox. On the surface, it‚Äôs a monthly subscription box of dog treats and toys. But BARK injects personality by creating boxes around a unique theme every month, much to the delight of both dogs and their owners.\n- Though BarkBox could simply put together random collections of dog goodies, it‚Äôs carefully curated its boxes to tell a fun story‚Äî‚Äùa monthly adventure, starring you and your dog!‚Äù Here are a few examples of its past themes:\n\t- [Australian Outbark](https://www.barkbox.com/themes/australian-outbark), an Australia-inspired collection with kangaroo and platypus dog toys\n\t- [The Muttcracker](https://www.barkbox.com/themes/muttcracker), a holiday box that plays off the world-famous ballet, ‚ÄúThe Nutcracker‚Äù\n\t- [Bud Hounds](https://www.barkbox.com/themes/bud-hounds), a set of ‚Äúfur-twenty‚Äù toys shaped like bongs and joints in honor of 4/20\n- Product isn‚Äôt the only place where BARK infuses its branding; its personality also comes across in its content. BARK speaks the language of dog enthusiasts, using words like ‚Äúzoomies‚Äù and ‚Äúdoggos‚Äù as well as silly puns and cartoons.\n- BARK‚Äôs content resonates with customers because it shows a clear appreciation for dogs and dog culture, just like its target audience. It‚Äôs not pompous or snarky; it‚Äôs quirky and joyful.¬†\n- And by leaning into this branding more than other pet retailers, BARK has successfully expanded to a wider variety of products, like BARK Eats and BARK Bright. People become loyal customers because ==BARK‚Äôs branding shows a real passion for dogs, one that mirrors their own.==\n\n## Zendesk\n- The customer service SaaS company Zendesk stood out when it first launched in 2007 with its bright green color palette, Buddha mascot, and playful messaging‚Äîa far cry from more stiff and formal B2B companies. Its mission: help businesses deliver exceptional customer service.\n- Though it was attention-grabbing, over time, Zendesk‚Äôs team realized the limitations of their branding. For one, their mascot was offensive, and trying to build a story around the character felt ‚Äúweird.‚Äù It also clashed with their mission to create good service.\n- So in 2016,¬†[Zendesk rebranded](https://www.zendesk.com/blog/new-zendesk-better-customer-relationships/). It shifted to a simpler geometric brand design, even creating mini-logos to represent each of its different services.\n- As a result, Zendesk could:\n\t-   **Show off its expanded product offerings.**¬†Its previous motto ‚ÄúLove your helpdesk‚Äù was replaced with ‚ÄúRelationships are complicated‚Äù‚Äîpointing to the different ways Zendesk can help with customer service.¬†\n\t-   **Better connect with customers.**¬†Since Zendesk‚Äôs team had avoided creating stories around their old mascot for fear of offending people, getting rid of it meant new storytelling potential.\n- Throughout the rebrand, Zendesk‚Äôs voice remained the same. It continued its playful and conversational messaging, but with a new aesthetic that aligned better with its mission.\n- In¬†[Brandland](https://brandland.zendesk.com/), the company‚Äôs detailed style guide, Zendesk emphasizes the importance of communicating in a ==charming and ‚Äúhumblident‚Äù (that is, humble yet confident) voice.== It doesn‚Äôt talk down to users, and it tries to avoid being hyperbolic. In fact, Brandland specifically advises against repeatedly calling Zendesk ‚Äúthe best.‚Äù¬†\n- Here are a few examples of how this voice appears on its website:\n\t- Champions of awesome free trials (homepage)\n\t-   As a company, we roll up our sleeves to plant roots in the communities we call home. (about page)\n\t-   This is your gateway to the magical land of Zendesk, where we help you improve relationships with your customers. (demo page)\n\t-   Our sale just got Suite-r (homepage)\n- For better or worse, Zendesk‚Äôs original design and subsequent rebranding show how branding can shape perceptions of a company. They also show how brands can evolve over time. With its new design, Zendesk could better appeal to users without offending them, all the while continuing to differentiate itself from traditionally stuffy B2B branding.","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.739605357Z","tags":null},"/Sources/Demand-Curve/Guiding-Principles-of-How-to-Approch-Growth":{"title":"Guiding Principles of How to Approch Growth","content":"[[Atlas/Maps/Demand Curve Growth MOC]]\n\nNow we‚Äôll turn to a few key principles to bear in mind as you develop your own growth strategy. These principles are essential to remember because they‚Äôll keep you focused on strategy, productive learning, and achievement. Here are the five principles we‚Äôll cover:  \n1: Focus is key  \n2: Try fewer channels for more concentrated growth  \n3: Growth = learning  \n4: Leverage compounds  \n5: The staircase of growth\n\n## Focus is key\n- **_Summary: Focus on strategy. Not ad hoc attempts to grow._**\n- We see too many teams spread themselves thin. They write tweets, draft email newsletters, publish guest blog posts, etc., without clear knowledge of how these activities will lead to customers and revenue.\n- **To establish focus, we're going to help you identify and perform repeatable activities that drive meaningful results for your revenue and customer base.**\n- You won‚Äôt be able to find those meaningful growth activities without testing them. Which leads us to the next principle.\n\n## Try fewer chanels for more concentrated growth\n- **_Summary: Focus on getting a few channels right, to avoid getting a lot of channels wrong._**\n- We work with lots of founders who have adopted the mentality that they should always be \"doing more\"‚Äîand doing more faster. Especially when it comes to growth. Startups that have hardly started marketing tell us about 10 different channels they'd like to test. Or they ask us how they can implement a sophisticated experimentation program so their team can start churning out at least 20 experiments a month.\n- Or, on the other side of the equation, they'll excitedly tell us how they found a channel that's consistently and profitably generating new customers, only to immediately follow it up with how they think they should start testing more channels in order to \"diversify.\"\n- We understand where these founders are coming from. Intuitively, it makes sense to test as many things as possible to figure out what works. But this mentality has some pitfalls.\n- **Why ‚Äúmore‚Äù isn‚Äôt better in acquisition strategy**\n\t- In the world of personal finance, we're taught that ==diversification is the name of the game.== Why? Because you're trying to reduce risk by spreading your money across stocks, instead of putting it all in a few stocks that you hope will take off. You're probably not in a rush‚Äîretirement might be years down the road. So diversification serves a great purpose: It reduces risk and increases security.\n\t- Contrast that with your typical startup. You don't have 30 years. You may have enough capital to only last six months. This is an entirely different ballgame. You likely can't survive on 10% annual growth rates. You need more significant growth, faster.\n\t- To do that, you're going to need to ==concentrate on only the channels that are most likely to work for you.== They‚Äôre the ones that will kick-start your growth. It‚Äôs riskier to try too many channels at once than it is to pick the ones that are best suited for your product, launch them, and evaluate their performance for continued optimization.\n- **Fewer channels means more concentrated investment, too**\n\t- It takes a lot of work (and often money) to get a single channel to work. You're competing with many other companies for the attention of your market. Many companies have entire teams dedicated to one channel alone. To give yourself a chance to succeed, you need to give a channel the time and attention it requires.\n\t- Here's what goes into launching a single channel such as Facebook ads:\n\t\t- **Prepare for launch:**¬†You'll conduct research, design ad creatives, write copy, set up your ad account, build your campaigns, set up pixels and conversion tracking, create landing pages, and more.\n\t\t- **Launch:**¬†You'll likely be spending at least $2,000/month (and more if you want to accelerate your learnings). Plus, you'll be closely monitoring and optimizing results. This takes time. And since you're new to this, there will be a learning curve. Things often take longer than expected.\n\t\t- **Iterate:**¬†If your initial test looks promising, you'll invest more resources into putting together new creatives and campaigns on an ongoing basis, as well as continually analyzing results and optimizing. You may also want to increase your spend to, say, $5,000 or $10,000/month.\n\t- Imagine if you tried to test four other channels at the same time. Each channel requires its own research, ads, tracking, and so on. Plus, now your initial cost has increased 5x. And once you launch, you'll have 5x as many channels to analyze, optimize, and continue creating new assets for. This often leads to ==subpar results== since ==your time and budget are spread so thin.== ==You can't give each channel the attention it requires.==\n\t- Our intention isn't to scare you into thinking growth is impossible. But¬†**focus matters**. Especially in the early stages of a company's life. Let's move on from hypotheticals to how we'll help you apply this concept throughout the program.\n\t\t- **Acquisition channels**\n\t\t\t- We're going to teach you our strategy and research framework, which will help you identify the one or two channels with the greatest chance of success. This course will also guide you in choosing the channels that are most likely to move the needle for your company.\n\t\t\t- This is a major shortcut. You won't¬†_need_¬†to test dozens of channels. You'll be able to jump straight to the ones best suited for your company and goals.\n\t\t- **Experiments \u0026 A/B tests**\n\t\t\t- Early on, when you have limited resources, site traffic, users, and time, you have to be exceptionally¬†_thoughtful and intentional_¬†with what you decide to test.\n\t\t\t- Why? Again, because we need big wins. Squeaking out 5% improvements isn't going to cut it.\n\t\t\t- Here's a simple but powerful chart to illustrate the point: ![[Extras/Media/Images/Growth Impact.png]]\n\t\t\t- Large companies have tons of traffic and can collect massive sample sizes. This allows them to run lots of A/B tests that may only move the needle by a couple of percentage points. But a 1% improvement is significant for a company like Google (which explains their famous experiment in which they split-tested 40 different shades of blue on a single toolbar).\n\t\t\t- It also allows them to be less thoughtful with what they test. If you can launch and conclude a test in a single day, it makes sense to lower your bar. Startups don't have this luxury. Whatever we prioritize, we need to have high conviction that it will produce major results.\n\n## Growth = learning\n#learning \n- **_Summary: Apply all learnings‚Äîfrom successes and failures‚Äîto future growth initiatives._**\n- A good growth strategy emphasizes feedback loops. These allow you and your team to quickly learn what‚Äôs working and what needs to be improved.\n- Growth is data driven. You‚Äôre going to learn how to apply the scientific method to your activities: hypothesis, test parameters, observation, and analysis.\n- **Most founders and startups struggle to learn from a failed experiment.**\n- Let's look at some examples:\n\t-   You launch an ad campaign, but it yields few new signups.\n\t-   You launch a new feature, but it doesn‚Äôt improve your customer retention rate.\n\t-   You create content for a new channel, but hardly any sales come through.\n- If you can't understand ==WHY each failed== and ==HOW to ensure that it doesn't fail again==, you've learned nothing.\n- The opposite can also be said: If something is working but you have no idea why or how to continue growing it, ==you don't really have a strategy. You simply got lucky.==\n- You'll learn how to create a growth strategy that includes ==systematic experiments.== Being systematic will help you know whether or not your experiments are worth continuing.\n- You'll also learn how to prioritize which activities to focus on. You'll find out how to collect the right kind of information to know when it‚Äôs time to double down, or when to move on to the next experiment.\n\n## Leverage compounds\n- **_Summary: Focus on high-leverage activities for compounded growth._**\n- How do startups with only a few people experience explosive growth and win out against established industry players that are hundreds of times bigger?\n- **They apply an extreme amount of force to a single point of leverage. Leverage is what allows tiny companies to create massive change.**\n- Leverage compounds, meaning that ==the high-leverage activities you do today will allow you to do more with fewer resources in the future.== And as you learned in the last principle (growth = learning), those who learn fast begin generating compounding effects earlier.\n- Therefore, to create maximum leverage, you'll want to ==learn as fast as possible in the beginning== , so you can ==turn that knowledge into growth==, and ==growth into leverage.==\n- Our program focuses on only high-leverage activities. **We know your time is valuable, which is why our program focuses on HOW to execute high-leverage activities.**\n- Soon you'll have a growth strategy that will keep you laser-focused on the opportunities with the highest likelihood of producing meaningful results.\n\n## The staircase of growth\n- **_Summary: Continuously optimize your business model for your channel._**\n- Growth often occurs in a step function, like stairs going upward. Here's how it works:\n\t- You'll get a growth activity to work well. You'll be acquiring new customers consistently, and your revenue will steadily increase.\n\t-   Then, for seemingly no reason in particular, growth will begin to slow. You'll see all your growth outputs plateau.\n- This tends to occur when you reach the ==upper ceiling== of a channel, market, or tactic‚Äîyou've reached ==all the possible customers that a single channel can reach.== This is a sign that you're ready to take a step up the staircase to the next level of growth.\n- For example:\n\t- Let's say you're selling a pool toy, and you start by selling door-to-door in your hometown. You know there are 10,000 pools within your town. The ceiling of selling using door-to-door as your growth channel is about 10,000 sales. Once you reach that point, you'll have to find another way to reach pool owners.\n\t- (You'll learn about conducting market research and the specifics of each growth channel in later modules, so don't worry about the details of this example.)\n\t- Now let's fast-forward: You've begun selling your pool toy through Facebook ads. You've now sold over 100,000 units, and things seem to be going well. But then you hit a plateau again.\n\t- Was it because of a market ceiling? Considering that there are over two billion people on Facebook and over¬†[10.4 million](https://comfyliving.net/swimming-pool-statistics/)¬†residential swimming pools in the US alone, it's highly unlikely that you've hit a ceiling.\n\t- What's more probable is that you've hit the¬†_point of diminishing returns_.\n\t- We'll explain this concept in more detail when you learn how to scale a growth channel that's working. But essentially it means that you're going to need to optimize your business model to match the channel you're selling through.\n\t- In future modules, we'll share ways to identify whether you're going to need to find a new strategy, and how to pivot when the time comes.","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.739605357Z","tags":null},"/Sources/Demand-Curve/How-Much-to-Charge":{"title":"How Much to Charge","content":"[[Atlas/Maps/Demand Curve Growth MOC]]\n\n- The last part of pricing strategy is the most salient: your actual price.\n- There are three standard methodologies for finding it:\n\t- **Value-based** ‚Äî price is based on the value your product creates for customers\n\t- **Cost-plus** ‚Äî price is based on the costs of making your product plus its profit margin\n\t- **Competitor-based** ‚Äî price is based on how your competitors are pricing\n- ==These aren‚Äôt mutually exclusive==‚Äîyou can use a combination of two or all three.

For the same reason that we recommend a usage-based structure: ==It directly ties your product‚Äôs price to its JTBD and the value customers get from it.==\n- As with usage-based structure, value-based pricing uses your value metric. If your value metric is videos, you would do market research and collect data to find out how much each video should cost.\n- That cost depends on your customer base‚Äôs ==willingness to pay.==\n- **Willingness to pay:**\n\t- the ==maximum price== customers are willing to pay for your product. \n\t- It‚Äôs a function of factors including:\n\t\t-   **Demand**. Demand is in turn influenced by seasonality, supply (whether there‚Äôs a surplus or shortage), trends, and economic conditions.\n\t\t-   **Perceived value**‚Äîhow much customers believe your product is worth. Perceived value also has various moving parts, including: the pricing and appeal of competitors/alternatives, how exclusive your product is, your brand perception, product quality, value props and positioning, and celebrity/influencer endorsements. It‚Äôs also affected by how much your product makes or saves users, how much it addresses pain points, and how¬†_urgently_¬†it addresses them.\n\t\t-   **Personas**. Willingness to pay can vary widely by cohort, which is one of the reasons why it‚Äôs so important to have customer personas. A customer with more disposable income (more buying power) might be willing to pay more. Age, gender, risk tolerance, and personal hobbies can all influence willingness to pay.\n\t- Getting willingness to pay wrong can be the beginning of the end for a startup. \n\t\t- For example, Juicero notoriously charged $699 for a juicer that, a Bloomberg report found, took just as long to squeeze juice as manual juice-squeezing took. Customers weren‚Äôt willing to pay that much. \n\t\t- Despite raising $118 million in funding, the company folded within 16 months.\n- **Who it‚Äôs for:**¬†We recommend value-based pricing for most companies. It‚Äôs the best methodology‚Äî_if_¬†you have the resources for it.\n\t- But not all startups will. Collecting and analyzing data for value-based pricing takes time. It takes having customers or prospects to talk to. ==Early-stage startups in particular might need to start with a simpler pricing methodology==, like a combination of cost-plus and competitor-based, then move toward value-based as their business matures.\n- **Pros:**\n\t-   Most data-driven method with the least amount of guesswork\n\t-   Puts the customer first\n\t-   Most directly tied to JTBD and the value your customers get\n\t-   Can result in a more customer-focused product roadmap‚Äîe.g., if you add features based on what customers want (and want to pay for)\n\t-   Best way to avoid underpricing\n\t-   Allows your pricing to evolve with your product\n- **Cons:**\n\t-   Requires a lot of data‚Äînot a con per se, but can be a setback. Finding out what customers think your product is worth can be a resource- and time-intensive process.\n\t-   Not an exact science‚Äîyou won‚Äôt be able to calculate your product‚Äôs precise perceived value. Close enough has to be good enough.\n\n### Cost-plus pricing\n- **What it is:**¬†pricing based on your costs and profit margin\n- Cost-plus pricing is the ==lowest-effort way to set a price==, since it doesn‚Äôt entail any customer or competitor research. \n\t- All it takes is a formula: **price = costs + target profit margin**\n\t- So if your product costs $50 to make (including all labor, overhead, and material costs) and you want to earn a 100% profit margin on it, you would calculate $50 + (100% of $50). Your price would be $100.\n- **Who it‚Äôs for:**¬†Cost-plus is often used for physical products like food and clothes. \n\t- Ecommerce retailer Everlane, for example,¬†[shows](https://www.everlane.com/about)¬†the costs that go into their denim, and how their price results from those costs plus markup\n\t- Cost-plus pricing can be useful for any early-stage startup, especially in combination with competitor-based pricing. But to scale their growth, mature SaaS companies should take a more value-based approach.\n- **Pro:**\n\t-   Quick and easy‚Äîjust requires a simple calculation\n- **Cons:**\n\t-   Doesn‚Äôt factor in customers‚Äô needs, expectations, or views of your product, which probably means growth potential isn‚Äôt fully realized. Your customers might be willing to pay more than you‚Äôre charging.\n\t-   Tendency to underestimate costs\n\t-   Tendency to undervalue your product, leaving revenue on the table\n\n### Competitor-based pricing\n- **What it is:**¬†pricing based on competitors‚Äô prices\n- Competitor-based pricing is straightforward. You look at what your competitors are charging, then set your price based on your findings.\n- **Who it‚Äôs for:**¬†It‚Äôs beneficial for any startup at any stage to know what their competitors are charging, as a benchmark if nothing else. If you‚Äôre entering‚Äîor in‚Äîa highly competitive vertical (e.g., many consumer product goods), or one in which price plays a large role in purchase conversion, competitor-based pricing will be especially useful.\n\t- But in general, it‚Äôs best as a ==supplement to other pricing methods==, not as a sole price determiner.\n**Pros:**\n- Low effort‚Äîjust look at your competitors‚Äô prices\n-   Keeps your product aligned with the market\n-   Low risk‚Äîyour price might not be optimal, but you‚Äôre unlikely to make a drastically wrong pricing decision\n**Cons:**\n-   Doesn‚Äôt factor in customers‚Äô needs, expectations, or views of your product, for limited growth potential\n-   Your competitors might not be doing it right\n-   You‚Äôre not your competitors. If your product is more valuable than what‚Äôs currently on the market, you‚Äôll lose revenue potential if you simply copy competitors‚Äô pricing.\n\n## Project: Find your price\n- Based on the above explanations, choose the pricing methodology (or combination of methodologies) that‚Äôs most appropriate for your startup. Use the following steps to implement it.\n- Even if value-based pricing isn‚Äôt right for your startup‚Äîor right for it now‚Äî**we**¬†**recommend collecting willingness-to-pay data**. It will be important as you scale and optimize.\n- To do this, we‚Äôll use a method called the¬†**Van Westendorp Price Sensitivity Meter**.\n### Value-based pricing\n- The Van Westendorp method, introduced by Dutch economist Peter van Westendorp in 1976, is a ==useful technique for collecting and analyzing willingness-to-pay data.== You can use it whether you‚Äôre sending out a survey or conducting customer interviews.\n- For now, we‚Äôll go over the questions to ask. We‚Äôll get into how to distribute those questions and analyze your results later in this module, on the page ‚ÄúProject: Pricing Market Research.‚Äù\n- But we do want to give a heads up here: The analysis stage isn‚Äôt a simple process. It takes Excel formulas and a graph with multiple curves. You might need to set aside a few hours to go through the process. ([Here it is](https://themaykin.com/blog/a-complete-guide-to-van-westendorp-how-to-graph-it-in-excel), in case you‚Äôd like a preview.)\n- Here are the two steps for asking Van Westendorp questions:\n\t1. As part of your survey or interview ‚Äúscript,‚Äù introduce your product. Describe what it does. Explain what customers get for what they pay for, but don‚Äôt include the actual price.\n\t2. Then ask these four questions:\n\t\t- At what price would you consider the product to be so expensive that you would never consider buying it?\n\t\t- At what price would you consider the product to be starting to get expensive, but you‚Äôd still consider buying it?\n\t\t- At what price would you consider the product to be a good deal‚Äîa bargain?\n\t\t- At what price would you consider the product to be so cheap that you‚Äôd question its quality?\n- Be sure to specify the currency. If your product has a subscription, also add a time interval to each question, e.g., ‚Äúat what monthly price‚Ä¶‚Äù This will ensure that the data you‚Äôre collecting is for a consistent time frame.\n### Cost-based pricing\n- To do cost-plus pricing, use the simple formula¬†**_price = costs + target profit margin_.**\n- What should your target profit margin be? The answer to that question is very ==industry-dependent.== A coffee shop‚Äôs profit margin will be much lower than a SaaS enterprise‚Äôs. Not only can SaaS enterprise charge more, but they might have fewer daily expenses, like equipment and storefront rent.\n- We recommend researching your industry‚Äôs standard profit margin by looking at resources like industry news and reports. Aswath Damodaran, an NYU professor of corporate finance and valuation, has a¬†[helpful breakdown of margins by sector](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/margin.html).\n- **Tip:**¬†We mentioned earlier that one of the cons of cost-plus pricing is the tendency to underestimate costs. To avoid this risk, make sure you factor in all the costs of producing your product or service (e.g., overhead, salaries, tools, etc.).\n### Competitor-based pricing\n- Competitor-based pricing research will be easy for you, since you‚Äôve already gone through the Competitor Research module.\n- Revisit the research you did then. Do a deeper dive on ==competitors‚Äô pricing strategies==: what they charge for, how they charge, how much they charge.\n- Look at ==market feedback== on their prices. Do any customer reviews comment on their pricing, calling it either too high or surprisingly low?\n- Optionally, you could use a design tool like Figma to create a chart for the data you collect, with price along the y-axis and another comparative measure‚Äîlike quality or similarity of feature sets (i.e., how similar a competitor‚Äôs feature set is to your own)‚Äîalong the x-axis. Here are some examples:\n\t- ![[Extras/Media/Images/Competitor Matrix.png]]\n- Then ==decide where you want your price to fit in.== Should it be lower than, higher than, or equal to your competitors‚Äô prices? Are there particular competitors you should price against? Where should your price fit on your chart?\n- ==Consider your value props when deciding.== If your product has exceptional quality compared to the market‚Äîand quality is something your customers are willing to pay for‚Äîthen you might go higher. Or if one of your value props is affordability, you might price lower than your competitors. It all goes back to your unique value props, always.","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.739605357Z","tags":null},"/Sources/Demand-Curve/How-to-Actually-Do-Competitor-Research":{"title":"How to Actually Do Competitor Research","content":"[[Atlas/Maps/Demand Curve Growth MOC]]\n\n- Let‚Äôs revisit the [[Five Fits Framework]] from our Growth Fundamentals unit: (See [[Sources/Demand Curve/The Five Fits Framework|The Five Fits Framework]])\n- To guide your research, we‚Äôll be applying the same framework to the competitors you‚Äôve identified to find out more about their growth strategies. Use our¬†[competitor research template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mX32pcCtGCMe88YT5y3X_vDeK4aEbY1GPiPyTCAnan4/edit?usp=sharing)¬†to record your findings.\n- The first step is ==getting a high-level overview of who exactly these competitors are.== This basic info gives background and context about the amount of time and resources it took for your competitors to reach their current stage.¬†\n- Use Crunchbase, LinkedIn, or Owler to find this info, including:\n\t-  Founding year\n\t-   Founder\n\t-   CEO\n\t-   Location(s)\n\t-   Number of employees\n\t-   Investors/funding\n\t-   Revenue\n\t-   Number of customers\n- Also try Googling press releases and interviews with your competitors‚Äô execs‚Äîyou can often find revenue data this way.¬†\n- Then move on to finding out your competitors‚Äô growth tactics, specifically by studying their landing pages, ads, and content marketing. We‚Äôll walk you through this‚Äîbut remember that your research here shouldn‚Äôt be overly concerned with uncovering finer details like your competitors‚Äô monthly ads budget. It‚Äôs more about finding what messaging and channels successful companies similar to yours are using, so you can better plan out your own growth strategy.\n\n## Landing pages\n- The easiest place to start with researching any competitor is their website. Pay attention to how they describe their brand and products, specifically their:\n\t- **Problem:**¬†The pain point your competitors focus on solving. How do they relate this to the user?¬†\n\t-   **Features:**¬†The design and tech behind their product. What features do they emphasize the most?\n\t-   **Pricing:**¬†How much they charge. Are any segments of your audience priced out? Do they offer different pricing plans?\n\t-   **Perks:**¬†The bonuses that come with the product, like early access to new features, an exclusive Slack community, etc. What makes these perks appealing?\n- The point of studying your competitors‚Äô websites isn‚Äôt to do a feature-by-feature product comparison with your own. Instead, ==consider how they‚Äôre communicating their product‚Äôs value. ==\n\t- What story does your competitor tell? \n\t- How do they describe the benefits of using their product? \n\t- And how do they position their product relative to others?\n- For example, here are some notes about Otter.ai based on its website.\n\t- **Problem:**¬†The main pain point Otter.ai addresses is note-taking at meetings.\n\t-   **Features:**¬†Otter.ai emphasizes its live and automatic transcriptions, note-taking, and meeting analytics.¬†\n\t-   **Pricing:**¬†There are two broad pricing categories for individuals and businesses, plus a specialized plan for those in education.\n- Otter.ai sells a voice transcription software, but its brand messaging focuses on ==how the company improves productivity by making information more accessible‚Äîand doing so cost-effectively.== Its biggest benefits: efficiency and convenience. Interestingly, it doesn‚Äôt refer to competitors or claim to be the best transcription service out there. Instead, it positions itself as a necessity alongside other remote communication tools like Zoom and Google Meet.\n\n### A/B tests\n- While browsing your competitors‚Äô pages, you might notice URL parameters, like:\n\u003e http://www.example.com/?optimizely_opt_out=true\n- This may be a sign of an ongoing A/B test‚Äîsomething worth noting because it means your competitor is trying to optimize some aspect of their site.\n- If you notice this, open the same URL in your browser‚Äôs incognito mode. Refresh until you see the page visually change. Then take screenshots to compare the variants. Use them to find and reverse engineer whatever hypothesis they‚Äôre testing. That might be:\n\t-   New value propositions\n\t-   Different product imagery\n\t-   Social proof, e.g. testimonial videos instead of written quotes\n- Even though you can‚Äôt see the results of their A/B test, you can consider whether the same variables are also worth testing on your site.\n\n## Ad channels\n- Another benefit of visiting your competitors‚Äô sites: ==getting retargeted.== Browse social media and elsewhere without an ad blocker to see what retargeting ads appear for your competitors.\n- Pay attention to the ads with the ==most comments and reactions.== This might reveal which ads are shown most often‚Äîpotentially the most successful ones.\n- Besides retargeting ads, also dig into Google, Facebook/Instagram, and LinkedIn to find out what other campaigns your competitors are running. Consider:\n\t-  Which platforms are they advertising on?¬†\n\t-   What users do they target?\n\t-   Where do their ads send users? Sales pages, blog posts, etc.\n- If your competitors have focused on a specific platform, it‚Äôs worth checking out that platform‚Äôs upcoming competitors‚Äîyou might find lower CACs with these new channels. For example, many consumer brands are focused on TikTok rather than Facebook because it‚Äôs cheaper and less saturated.\n\n### Google search ads\n- To find out what keywords competitors target in their search ads, use Ahrefs.\n\t1.  Enter your competitor‚Äôs URL.\n\t2.  Scroll down to find¬†**Paid Search**¬†in the sidebar. Click to expand the menu.\n\t3.  Click¬†**PPC keywords**.\n- Ahrefs also shows the top landing pages competitors‚Äô search ads lead to if you click¬†**Top landing pages**. This is helpful for understanding how companies are segmenting users based on value props and audience type.¬†\n- For example, Ahrefs‚Äô data shows that Vrbo targets travelers interested in vacationing in the South, especially Florida. It targets several location-specific keywords and directs users to a corresponding targeted search page, like one specifically for Gatlinburg cabin rentals.\n\n### Facebook ads\n- The¬†[Facebook Ads Library](https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?active_status=all\u0026ad_type=political_and_issue_ads\u0026country=US\u0026media_type=all)¬†shows any company‚Äôs active or inactive Facebook or Instagram ads. Search the name your competitors use on their Facebook Pages. You‚Äôll find their ad copy and creatives, even different versions of each ad if they exist. Click the¬†**See Ad Details**¬†button to find these details.\n- You can‚Äôt see ad comments or reactions but you can find out what competitors are testing and get ideas for your own ads. For example, we can see ClickUp is testing different video ads with the same copy, and trying social proof in another ad‚Äôs copy.\n\n### Linkedin ads\n- To see what ads companies are using on LinkedIn:\n\t1.  Go to a business page. Click on¬†**Posts**, and then¬†**Ads**. You‚Äôll see all your competitor‚Äôs ads.\n\t2.  To view any ad‚Äôs original post and engagement, click the three dots in the corner of the ad. Then click¬†**Copy link to post**. You‚Äôll receive a notification about the link being copied to your clipboard‚Äîclick¬†**View Post**.\n- Look at the original posts to find out which ads got the most reactions and comments. Also click on them to find out what kinds of landing pages competitors are sending their paid traffic to.\n\n## Content marketing\n### SEO\n- Use¬†[Ahrefs](https://ahrefs.com/)¬†or¬†[Semrush](https://www.semrush.com/)¬†to find out the top keywords your competitors rank for, plus estimates for how much traffic each of their pages get. Although they‚Äôre not always accurate, these estimates give clues on what landing pages and blog posts drive the most visitors to your competitors.¬†\n- Take a look at the top-performing pages and how they‚Äôre structured.\n\t-   What types of keywords do they rank highly for?\n\t-   What is the goal of the content‚Äîto educate, entertain, sell, or something else?\n\t-   Who is the content written for?\n- Ahrefs‚Äô¬†**Top Content**¬†option also shows which pages have received the most backlinks. Don‚Äôt fixate on the specific number of backlinks; instead, ==consider what themes are common across your competitors‚Äô most popular pages.¬†==\n\t- For example, several of Zapier‚Äôs top blog posts are listicles about productivity apps.\n- Ahrefs‚Äô data on social performance isn‚Äôt as strong, so use¬†[BuzzSumo](https://buzzsumo.com/)¬†to find out which pages have gotten the most shares. Here‚Äôs Zapier again, with different blog posts getting lots of traction on social media.\n- You can then cross-check these pages in Ahrefs to find out their organic keywords‚Äîa great way to find the sweet spot of content topics that have high search volume and reader interest.\n### Brand awareness\n- Use¬†[Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/?geo=US)¬†to find out how branded searches for your competitors have changed over time. ==These charts act as rough proxies for how well a company is doing.== If searches for a company‚Äôs name are going down, their awareness may be declining, which could mean their growth efforts are failing.\n- On the other hand, more recent branded searches might mean their growth tactics are working‚Äîbut you should always take this with a grain of salt. ==There could be other reasons outside of a company‚Äôs control for why branded searches have spiked.¬†==\n\t- For example, you can see that happen for WeWork in fall 2019, when its IPO failed.\n- Still, Google Trends‚Äô data can be a helpful barometer for understanding how a company‚Äôs brand awareness has grown over time. A steady decline is also worth studying as a cautionary tale for what might have gone wrong.\n### Social media\n- When studying competitors‚Äô social media, it can feel overwhelming to look through so many channels. It‚Äôs also tempting to fixate on vanity metrics like likes and followers‚Äîbut these numbers are often misleading because companies can pay to inflate them.\n- We don‚Äôt recommend an intensive audit here‚Äî==the goal is to find out if organic social media is worth pursuing as a growth strategy.== Focus on answering these three questions:\n\t1.  **Are competitors using social media?**¬†This isn‚Äôt just about whether they have an Instagram page. Do they actively post new content? If companies last posted more than six months ago or do so very sporadically, it‚Äôs a good sign that they‚Äôre not really investing in social media. Or, if they used to create a lot of YouTube videos but no longer, then it may mean that the ROI wasn‚Äôt there.\n\t2. **If competitors are active on social media,¬†_how_¬†are they using it?**¬†Which platforms do they use? Do they partner with influencers? Skim through your competitors‚Äô active channels to get an idea of their messaging and the nature of their content. For example, some companies focus on creating educational content like¬†[HubSpot‚Äôs YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/hubspot/featured). Others provide entertainment, like¬†[BarkBox‚Äôs Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/barkbox/).\n\t3. **How do users respond to their content?**¬†Avoid putting a lot of weight on followers and likes. Instead, look at comments on your competitors‚Äô active channels. Companies can buy comments, too, but it‚Äôs easier to identify fake ones (usually a single word or only emojis). See if users are leaving meaningful comments. If so, what is the consumer sentiment? A few quick ways to identify the most popular content on some channels:\n\t\t- **Twitter:**¬†Use¬†[SocialBearing](https://socialbearing.com/)¬†to look up your competitor‚Äôs Twitter handle. It‚Äôll return an analytics page. (Click Load More to see more data.) Scroll down to the tweets and click the Sort tweets by dropdown menu. Sort by retweets, favorites, and so on to see which tweets got the most interactions.\n\t\t- **Instagram:**¬†Study competitor accounts on desktop. You can‚Äôt easily sort posts but you can hover your cursor over them to see how many likes and comments they‚Äôve received. Study posts with the most comments.¬†\n\t\t- **YouTube:**¬†Go to a channel‚Äôs videos, and click the Sort by dropdown menu. Sort by ‚ÄúMost popular‚Äù to see which videos got the most views; then click to see their comments.¬†\n\t\t- **TikTok:**¬†You can‚Äôt sort a TikTok account‚Äôs videos by likes, but the view count is shown on each video thumbnail in their feed. This number is insightful in itself because it tells you which videos grabbed users‚Äô attention. Look for those with the most views; then click to see its likes and comments.\n- Remember: The point here isn‚Äôt to dissect your competitors‚Äô social media performance, but rather, ==see whether users actually care about it.== Authentic user comments are a good barometer for this because only the most engaged people will respond.","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.739605357Z","tags":null},"/Sources/Demand-Curve/How-to-Apply-Customer-Research-to-Marketing-and-Product":{"title":"How to Apply Customer Research to Marketing and Product","content":"[[Atlas/Maps/Demand Curve Growth MOC]]\n\n- Once you‚Äôve identified the job that your product should solve, you can apply your insights to optimize your marketing funnel.\n- We recommend the psych framework here, which comes from growth expert¬†[Darius Contractor](https://darius.com/increase-funnel-conversion-with-psych-7378d51c4caf). Though Darius uses the framework for landing page optimization, it‚Äôs applicable to the entire marketing funnel.\n- Applying the psych framework is easiest for companies that have a customer journey map. Looking at the customer‚Äôs timeline and your research, consider:\n\t-   What barriers exist when users try to learn about your product?\n\t-   How long does it take for users to go through the signup/purchase process?¬†\n\t-   How long does it take for users to get their job done after hiring your product?\n\t-   Where might users become the most excited or frustrated in their journey? Why?\n- The ultimate goal of the psych framework is to ==identify friction along the customer journey‚Äîand then get rid of it for maximum user ‚Äúpsych.‚Äù== According to the framework:\n\t- A user‚Äôs experience with a brand and product affects their emotional energy.\n\t-   You can think of and measure ==emotional energy as units of ‚Äúpsych.‚Äù ==The highest level of emotional energy is 100 psych.\n\t-   Poor marketing/product elements lower users‚Äô psych while good elements raise it. Someone with 0 psych is exhausted by the experience, and will not continue using it. High levels of psych lead to continued use.\n\t-   Companies must optimize their marketing and product to preserve users‚Äô psych, not drain it.\n- Here‚Äôs how that might look in practice‚Äîonce again, we‚Äôll use Shopify as an example.\n\n| **Stage**   | **+ Psych Elements**                                                                                                                                                        | **Psych Elements**                                                                                                                                                      |\n| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Exploring   | - ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs so much demand for my products‚ÄîI bet I could sell even more online‚Äù - ‚ÄúI‚Äôve heard Shopify can help you open an online store even if you‚Äôre not a tech expert‚Äù    | -   Misconceptions and doubt about the potential ROI of setting up an ecommerce shop - Administrative work attached to opening a store, e.g., registering your business |\n| Considering | -   ‚ÄúShopify is the first result in Google when I look for info about starting an online shop‚Äù - ‚ÄúI‚Äôve noticed some of my favorite stores say they‚Äôre ‚Äòpowered by Shopify‚Äô‚Äù | -   ‚ÄúShopify ads are appearing everywhere‚Äù -   Shopify competitors have compelling social media posts -   Downloadable resources on competitor blogs                    |\n| Deciding    | -   A close friend recommends Shopify -   Shopify‚Äôs website includes case studies and real-life example -   Receiving an exclusive Shopify promotion via email              | -   There‚Äôs no free plan available - A negative YouTube review about Shopify -   ‚ÄúThe signup process asks for so much info‚Äù                                             |\n| Consuming   | -   Easy-to-read guides and video tutorials - Beginner-friendly templates -   A customer success manager reaches out to offer help                                          | -   Receiving too many emails from Shopify -   ‚ÄúShopify SEO is hard to figure out‚Äù  -   Transaction fees reduce revenue  -   Limited customization options              |\n| Loyalty     | -   A fast email response from customer service -   Lots of easy integrations with Shopify                                                                                  | -   Transaction fees -   Limited customization  -   Speaking with a rude or unhelpful support team member                                                               |\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n\n- Not all psych elements are in your control, like when people encounter a problem for the first time in the exploring phase. Some elements are also inherent to the problem or the market, like if there‚Äôs a large number of competitors for people to pick from.\n- Despite this, the psych framework is great for ==identifying elements that¬†_are_¬†within your control==, which may have been overlooked otherwise. You may find that negative psych elements outweigh the positive in one stage, meaning more optimization work is needed.\n\n## Focus on your customers, not your product\n- Many founders justify focusing on their product and its features by claiming that the product will sell itself. We‚Äôve seen this across all niches and industries, including new trends like blockchain, AI, and the Internet of Things.\n- But to hold people‚Äôs interest, new features and technologies aren‚Äôt the most important thing. Novelty only gets you so far, especially as competitors catch up.¬†\n- The biggest takeaways for market and customer research:\n\t-   The ==problem your product solves== is what makes your company important to customers.\n\t-   Without understanding this problem, you won‚Äôt be able to identify your target audience.\n\t-   Use the JTBD framework and research to find out the problem your users most want to solve. Then build or refine your product based on your findings.","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.739605357Z","tags":null},"/Sources/Demand-Curve/How-to-Charge":{"title":"How to Charge","content":"[[Atlas/Maps/Demand Curve Growth MOC]]\n\n- Your pricing structure is **how you charge for your products or services.** We‚Äôll cover the five most common and effective ones below. Once we‚Äôve gone over them, we'll give you guidance on how to select the model that makes the most sense for your business.\n- Since pricing for physical products is pretty obvious, we‚Äôll just briefly touch on it. With a few exceptions‚Äîe.g., consumables like monthly coffee delivery‚Äîphysical products charge per product.\n- The focus here is on pricing for intangible products/services, so if you‚Äôre in the physical-product realm, you can probably skip ahead to the next page.\n- Two rules of thumb when it comes to pricing structure:\n\t1.  **Keep your pricing simple.**¬†There‚Äôs a reason why tiered pricing usually has a max of four tiers‚Äîmore than that could overwhelm the buyer. ==Don‚Äôt add friction to the buying process by making the conversion point too complex.==\n\t2.  **Don‚Äôt innovate for the sake of being different.**¬†If your industry has a standard pricing structure, you could introduce friction if you try something totally different. If an innovative revenue model is a core part of your business concept, then your pricing will look different from most. But most startups don‚Äôt need to invent a new model‚Äîat least not at this stage. Instead of focusing on innovation, ==aim for efficiency, low risk, and high growth potential.==\n## Pricing structures\n- Below are five standard pricing structures. As you‚Äôll see, there can be overlaps between them.\n- Note: We don‚Äôt include freemium here because we think of it as ==part of a product and acquisition strategy, not a revenue model.== It‚Äôs a way to acquire and convert customers, but it‚Äôs outside the scope of how and what they pay for (i.e., a pricing model).

It‚Äôs increasingly becoming the SaaS¬†_true_¬†standard, in addition to being the¬†_gold_¬†standard.\n- Usage-based pricing is especially effective for products that have ==built-in stickiness and repeatable, consistent usage.== Customers wouldn‚Äôt one-and-done a business like Square, so it makes sense for them to charge per transaction.\n- Although we recommend a usage-based approach generally, it doesn‚Äôt always make the most sense for startups. ==If your startup is very young, you might not have enough data to know the value of your metric.== You might need to start out with a different structure (you can always switch over).\n- We‚Äôll get into metric value more in How Much to Charge, and we‚Äôll go over how to get data in the project for this module. But for now, here are two hypotheticals of what we mean by ==insufficient data==:\n\t- **Few client relationships:**¬†Your food-delivery app launched a month ago. You only have a handful of restaurant partners, so you have little data on what they‚Äôre willing to pay per transaction. You decide to charge a fixed monthly fee for now, until you‚Äôve collected more data about what partners are willing to pay and how much they think your service is worth.\n\t-  **Limited client understanding:**¬†Your collaboration platform launched half a year ago, but you don‚Äôt have a clear sense yet of who your actual customers are. You‚Äôre still relying on pre-launch best-guess buyer personas. Until you‚Äôve analyzed your real buyers and gathered specific insights about the features they value most and how much they value them, you might need a different structure, like per-user pricing.\n- If you¬†_do_¬†have a lot of data, you‚Äôll face another challenge: analyzing it. ==Usage-based pricing requires data science.== It‚Äôs not enough to know what your value metric is. You also have to know:\n\t- What it‚Äôs worth\n\t-   Often, what it‚Äôs worth by segment\n\t-  How to forecast it based on consumption, possibly amid high variability\n- So although we recommend usage-based pricing, ==we don‚Äôt recommend jumping into it without resources.== Make sure you have the data and data analytics to know not only that it‚Äôs right for your business, but that you know your metric‚Äôs worth.\n- **Examples of usage-based pricing:**\n\t- Mailchimp‚Äîprice is based on the number of contacts. This is a subscription usage-based structure, with users paying monthly.\n\t-   Zapier‚Äîprice is based on the number of ‚Äútasks.‚Äù Another monthly subscription.\n\t-   Amazon Web Services‚ÄîAWS has ‚Äúpay-as-you-go‚Äù pricing. Charges are based on which services you use and how long you use them. An example of non-subscription usage-based pricing.\n\t-   Postmates‚Äîprice is based on orders (unless you sign up for a flat-fee monthly membership)\n\t-   The¬†[Barcelona comedy club](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-29551380)¬†that charges per laugh\n- **Pros:**\n\t- As mentioned earlier, companies that use value metrics typically double their growth rate vs. flat-fee or strictly feature-based tier pricing\n\t- Aligns your pricing with your value props‚Äîand what your customers get value from \n\t-  Low friction‚Äîinitial cost to the user is low\n- **Cons:**\n\t-   Requires significant data and customer learnings\n\t-   Risky if you get it wrong\n\t-   Potential taxi-meter effect\n\t-   Can make revenue projection less predictable\n\n### Tiered-pricing\n- **What it is:**¬†Multiple pricing tiers. The pricier the tier, the more the customer gets.\n- There‚Äôs plenty of overlap between tiered and usage-based pricing. \n\t- Examples include Netflix (three tiers, with more screens the higher you go), Shopify Payments (three tiers, with lower credit card rates and transaction fees the higher you go), and Evernote (three tiers, with more storage the higher you go). \n\t- Tiers can also have feature upgrades or a combination of usage-based pricing and feature upgrades.\n- **Who it‚Äôs for:**¬†Tiered pricing is often used for SaaS, but it can also be used for physical products, such as different tiers for different combinations or quantities of subscription products.\n- **Examples of tiered pricing:**\n\t-   Spotify Premium‚Äîfour tiers with more features as you move from an individual to a family plan (with a lower-cost student plan)\n\t-   Peloton membership‚Äîtwo tiers, standard and all-access, with different features. All-access is only available to Peloton equipment owners.\n\t-   LinkedIn Premium‚Äîfour plans based on different goals: Career, Business, Sales Navigator Professional, and Recruiter Lite\n- **Pros:**\n\t-   Often much simpler to start with than non-tiered usage-based pricing. Needs less data and fewer customer learning insights.\n\t-   Encourages upgrading once a user is hooked into the product but reaches the limit of their tier\n\t-   Effective way to highlight a rich feature set\n- **Cons:**\n\t- Compared to non-tiered usage-based pricing, you‚Äôre missing out on revenue potential. Patrick Campbell, the CEO of ProfitWell, represents this graphically:\n\t\t- ![[Extras/Media/Images/Revenue Potential Comparison.png]]\n\t- Could introduce friction by requiring a decision at the purchase conversion point (which is why one tier is often ‚Äúrecommended‚Äù)\n\t- Your different tiers‚Äô perceived values are being set¬†_against_¬†each other.\n\n### Flat-rate pricing\n- **What it is:**¬†One price per product/service for all buyers\n- Flat-rate pricing can take a few different forms. \n\t- It can be a one-time payment‚Äîtypically paid upfront, as with ecommerce. \n\t- Or it can be a subscription type with a single rate instead of different tiers. Every subscriber pays the same every month/year as every other subscriber.\n- **Who it‚Äôs for:**¬†One-time upfront payments work ==when the majority of value is realized and delivered immediately upon purchase==, or ==when value isn't distributed equally and consistently over time.==\n- A flat-rate subscription can work ==if all your buyer personas share a comparable willingness to pay== (more on that on the next page), or ==if you have only one or two personas.==\n- Because of its simplicity, and because it doesn‚Äôt require a ton of customer data, ==flat-rate pricing can be an attractive option for early-stage startups.==\n- **Examples of flat-rate pricing:**\n\t-   Strava‚Äîthere‚Äôs one subscription plan for everyone (plus a freemium option)\n\t-   Demand Curve‚Äîstudents pay once upfront and then don‚Äôt have any subsequent fees\n\t-   Bon Appetit‚Äîother than some discount options (e.g., for students and educators), everyone pays the same amount for a digital + print subscription\n\t-   Pretty much all retail ecommerce\n- **Pros:**\n\t-   Simplicity\n\t-   Transparency‚Äîeasy to communicate and market\n\t-   Avoids ==‚Äúsubscription fatigue‚Äù== (as one Redditor¬†[put it](https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/a2xeg9/this_transition_into_monthly_subscriptions_is/), ‚ÄúI want services, yes. But, I don't need them every month. And, if I do, I want to out-right buy the product. Not be told I have to pay $x.xx a month for it.‚Äù)\n- **Cons:**\n\t-   Doesn‚Äôt factor in cohorts or personas. Every user pays the same, although needs can vary widely.\n\t-   Can have high initial friction if there‚Äôs a sizable upfront cost (especially for new companies that don‚Äôt have brand recognition yet and are entering competitive verticals)\n\n### Per-user pricing\n- **What it is:**¬†A subscription type that charges per user or seat\n- **Who it‚Äôs for:**¬†Often used in SaaS, especially for team-based and enterprise products\n- Per-user pricing works best ==when individual seats offer unique value.== Logging in to one account provides a different experience from logging in to another. Maybe the data you‚Äôre accessing is different, or maybe the experience is tailored to your specific habits or needs.\n- Examples of tool types that offer unique value for different seats:\n\t-   A B2B tool for managing sales leads, pipelines, etc. One salesperson‚Äôs pipeline will look different from another‚Äôs, so it makes sense for them to have separate seats.\n\t-   A tool with individual user profiles or histories (such as work/activity history)\n\t-   Software that handles private information. Users shouldn‚Äôt share their logins.\n\t-   A collaboration/communication platform with network effects‚Äîmeaning that everyone gets more value from the product when more team members use it\n- Another use case for per-user pricing: When you can‚Äôt find a strong value metric or proxy, ==charging by user can be a decent alternative to usage-based pricing.==\n- **Real-world examples of per-user pricing:**\n\t-   Donut‚Äîfour tiers based on the number of users. Tier 1 is for 1-24 users, Tier 4 is for 100+.\n\t-   Salesforce‚Äîfour tiers: Essential, Sales Professional, Service Professional, and Pardot Growth. Each charges per user per month.\n\t-   Gusto‚Äîfour B2B tiers with per-user pricing for each, plus a contractor-only plan\n\t-   Auth0‚ÄîB2C and B2B plans are based on monthly active users\n- As you can see, per-user pricing is often used in conjunction with another structure‚Äîtypically either tiered or usage-based pricing. If you‚Äôre going to implement per-user pricing, that‚Äôs what we recommend: ==pairing it with another structure.==\n\t-   **Per-user + tiered:**¬†Per-user pricing can have its own form of taxi-meter effect. Charging by tier instead of individual user makes the ‚Äúmore users, more money‚Äù concept less salient.\n\t-   **Per-user + usage-based:**¬†One way to combine per-user and usage-based pricing is by charging for¬†_active_¬†users instead of¬†_all_¬†users‚Äîso customers are getting more value with more use (and so they don‚Äôt have to pay for inactive seats). Another way is with add-ons. You could either 1) have usage-based core pricing with add-ons per number of users, or 2) have per-user core pricing with feature add-ons.\n- **Pros:**\n\t- Simplicity, for low friction\n\t- Transparency‚Äîalso a friction reducer\n\t- Revenue projection is more predictable than with usage-based pricing, and pricing is more predictable for customers\n- **Cons:**\n\t-   If separate seats don‚Äôt add value to the end user, per-user pricing isn‚Äôt aligned with product value. This can lead to reduced revenue and lower conversion rates, since companies won‚Äôt see the value in paying for additional seats.\n\t-   Doesn‚Äôt factor in cohorts or personas. Every user pays the same, although needs can vary widely.\n\t-   Seats can get shared\n\n### Variable pricing\n- **What it is:**¬†Pricing that varies\n- In SaaS and B2B, variable pricing often takes the form of a ==‚Äúcontact us‚Äù CTA on a company‚Äôs pricing page==, instead of a listed price. Prices are ==negotiated on a per-customer basis.== It‚Äôs principally used for enterprise customers.\n- Variable pricing isn‚Äôt the same thing as dynamic pricing, which is when prices change based on market demand (like Uber surge pricing). We‚Äôll discuss dynamic pricing in ‚ÄúPricing: Bonus Tactics.‚Äù\n- **Who it‚Äôs for:**¬†Enterprise B2B, high-value products and services. Variable¬†_pricing_¬†is a good option if you have variable¬†_costs_¬†in your client relationships. For example, if you know that a customer will require extensive onboarding and relationship management, you can negotiate a higher price with them. If you‚Äôre building custom software for a client, or if they require more of your team‚Äôs time or resources than others, it makes sense to give them a custom rate.\n- **Examples of variable pricing:**\n\t-   ClickUp‚Äîfive tiers (including a freemium plan) with a ‚Äúcontact sales‚Äù CTA for the highest\n\t-   Notion‚Äîfour tiers, from Personal to Enterprise. Signing up for Enterprise requires contacting sales.\n\t-   Agencies that negotiate contracts for unique deliverables with individual clients\n\t- \n- **Pros:**\n\t-   Flexibility, especially if your costs are variable per customer\n- **Cons:**\n\t-   Lack of transparency\n\t-   Adds complexity to your sales team's job, and adds to their workload\n\t-   Risk of inefficiency, e.g., if building custom deals produces lower net profit than offering non-custom deals would, or if the time it takes your team to build those deals is lower ROI than other activities\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.739605357Z","tags":null},"/Sources/Demand-Curve/How-to-Define-Your-Brand":{"title":"How to Define Your Brand","content":"- Building a brand isn‚Äôt a one-time task or project‚Äîit‚Äôs an ongoing process for as long as your company‚Äôs in business. Remember, ==your branding comes across in every one of its interactions with the market==; it‚Äôs in all of your product(s), sales, and marketing.\n- Because of this, there are a¬†lot of components to branding. Early-stage companies shouldn‚Äôt get bogged down in the details, though. Instead, we advise focusing on these four foundational elements:\n\t-   Mission statement\n\t-   Company story\n\t-   Brand voice\n\t-   Brand design\n## Mission statement\n- Your company‚Äôs mission statement is a short description (usually no more than one sentence) of its main goals. It serves both an external and internal purpose:\n\t- **Externally**, it communicates what your company cares about to better relate to customers.¬†\n\t-   **Internally**, it guides strategic decisions about your product, business model, ideal audience, and acquisition channels (the other four pieces of your company‚Äôs [[Five Fits Framework]]).\n- Here are a few examples:\n\t-   Slack: Make work life simpler, more pleasant and more productive.\n\t-   Uber: We ignite opportunity by setting the world in motion.\n\t-   Tesla: To accelerate the world‚Äôs transition to sustainable energy.\n- Your mission statement should be a concise, high-level statement. ==It shouldn‚Äôt get into the weeds of what products or services you create. ==\n\t- Consider how in the examples above, Slack‚Äôs mission doesn‚Äôt mention ‚Äúmessaging app.‚Äù Similarly, Uber doesn‚Äôt say anything about ridesharing, bike and scooter rentals, or food delivery; and Tesla doesn‚Äôt refer to its electric cars or solar panels.\n## Company story\n- Think of your company story as a more detailed expansion of your mission statement. It‚Äôs a narrative about how your company came to be and why it does what it does.\n- The most effective company stories ==stir emotion.== Remember that as humans, we‚Äôre drawn to stories because they engage and inspire us. They help us process information in a much more memorable way than simply reading a list of statistics.¬†\n- There are two philosophies for how to frame your company story:\n\t- **Origin:**¬†This approach focuses on you, the founder, and how your company came to be. It‚Äôs best for those with interesting or unusual backgrounds. Consider how a broke Sophia Amoruso opened an eBay store for her vintage finds, which eventually became the Nasty Gal fashion brand.\n\t- **Consumer-focused:**¬†This approach places customers as the focal point of the company story, describing how they inspired your product or how your product fits into their life. These stories work best for companies that have more straightforward origins, e.g., you saw an unmet need and created a product to address it.\n- Neither approach is better than the other‚Äîthey‚Äôre simply different storytelling methods. That said, both approaches should tie your company‚Äôs success to the customer in some way.¬†\n- Here‚Äôs an example of an origin story from Airbnb:\n\t- ![[Extras/Media/Images/Airbnb origin story.png]]\n\t- Using the origin approach, Airbnb tells the story of how its founders hosted guests in their apartment. But it still ties this narrative to its customers, noting that both hosts and guests create the deeper connection that sets Airbnb apart. So despite initially focusing on its founders, Airbnb‚Äôs story positions customers as a part of its success.\n- Companies that don‚Äôt have an emotionally compelling history might struggle to create an origin story that feels authentic. In this case, it‚Äôs better to write your company story using a consumer-focused approach.\n- Here‚Äôs an example from the ballpoint pen company BIC:\n\t- ![[Extras/Media/Images/BIC company story.png]]\n\t- Notice how BIC describes itself as giving consumers ‚Äúthe power of creative expression.‚Äù The story revolves around BIC‚Äôs goal to ‚Äúanswer a fundamental consumer need‚Äù rather than details about its founders. It‚Äôs inspiring without being over the top.\n- Regardless of how your company got started, your company story shouldn‚Äôt just be about making money. Give it some emotion so it can resonate more deeply with your audience.¬†\n- Some questions worth asking:\n\t- How does your product serve customers?¬†\n\t-   What value does your product provide?\n\t-   Why should customers choose your company over a direct competitor?\n- ==Tap into emotion authentically==, whether through your interesting background or how your product serves your customer.¬†\n- One last note: ==Your company story doesn‚Äôt need to be long.== Airbnb‚Äôs is 230 words; BIC‚Äôs is 117. Aim for under 250 words. Keep it simple.\n## Brand voice\n- Your brand voice is how your company would sound if it were a person. It comes across in all of your company‚Äôs communications, including its:\n\t-   Website: blog, site popups, product pages, error pages\n\t- Emails: promotional messages, newsletters, order confirmations\n\t-   Customer support\n\t-   Social media posts\n\t-   Ads\n- A single adjective like ‚Äúcasual‚Äù doesn‚Äôt cut it. Your brand voice should have more depth, ==like a real person.== And it should ==align with your company‚Äôs mission and target audience.¬†==\n- Consider Dove and Old Spice, two companies in the personal care space. They both have casual brand voices, but very different personalities. While Dove focuses on being empowering, Old Spice leans into absurdity. Given Dove‚Äôs mission to help women develop a positive relationship with their appearance, it obviously wouldn‚Äôt make sense for it to use the same voice as Old Spice.\n- Since brand voices can be complex, many companies create guidelines to nail them down. Here are examples and select phrases from three major companies.\n\t-  [Mailchimp](https://styleguide.mailchimp.com/voice-and-tone/): ‚ÄúWe speak like the experienced and compassionate business partner we wish we‚Äôd had way back when. We treat every hopeful brand seriously. We want to educate people without patronizing or confusing them.‚Äù\n\t- [Trip Advisor](https://tripadvisor.mediaroom.com/download/TheNewTripAdvisor_StyleGuide.pdf): ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt boss you around, or confuse you with jargon‚Äîwe just make it easy for you to find what you need, when you need it. ‚Ä¶ We share our enthusiasm in an authentic way that balances the positive with the pragmatic.‚Äù\n\t- [Dell](https://i.dell.com/sites/content/business/solutions/greenit/en/Documents/000guidelines.pdf): ‚ÄúSpeaking with the frankness one would expect from a friend, the tone of Dell is engaging and candid. We are bold enough to let the facts speak for themselves.‚Äù\n- As an early-stage company, you probably don‚Äôt need to create a detailed style guide. But you should give your brand voice serious consideration‚Äîwe‚Äôll walk through an exercise to better define it in our Brand Voice project.\n## Brand design\n- Brand design revolves around the visual elements that represent your company. Compared to the other branding components we‚Äôve highlighted, it can be the most expensive. That‚Äôs because brand design requires a high level of both skill and creativity.¬†\n- Though it can encompass a lot, here are the most important components:\n\t- A logo that‚Äôs unique and recognizable\n\t-   A defined color palette with 2-4 colors\n\t-   2-3 complementary fonts as your company‚Äôs typography\n\t-   Company iconography‚Äîthe graphic symbols that communicate specific actions, e.g., a shopping cart, messaging bubble\n\t-   Custom imagery that illustrates your product, its benefits, etc.¬†\n\t-   A cohesive website that uses all of the above assets\n- While you can develop your company‚Äôs mission statement, story, and brand voice internally, brand design often requires outsourcing. Here‚Äôs what to expect in costs:\n\t-   For¬†**mid-tier and high-quality agencies**, $50,000-$150,000\n\t-   For¬†**expert freelancers**, $30,000-$50,000\n- Many early-stage companies can‚Äôt afford to spend $30,000 on brand design. So we recommend working on your mission statement, story, and brand voice yourself and spending no more than $5,000 on brand design. Use 99designs, Upwork, or Fiver and focus on getting a logo, brand colors, typography, and iconography.\n- There‚Äôs no need to prioritize getting a custom website and images because there are cost-effective solutions like website builders and stock photo sites. Consider investing more in brand design when you can afford it (whether because you raise money or generate enough revenue to spend the recommended $30,000 to $150,000).¬†\n- We‚Äôve seen companies try taking the middle road, spending a moderate amount on branding, like $20,000 to $30,000. But they usually get the same results they‚Äôd have seen with a budget of $5,000 to $10,000. From our experience, brand design is a situation where the phrase ==‚Äúgo big or go home‚Äù== applies. As in, the top-tier design talent and experts in branding are well worth their large price tags.","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.739605357Z","tags":null},"/Sources/Demand-Curve/How-to-Determine-Your-Products-Job":{"title":"How to Determine Your Product's Job","content":"[[Atlas/Maps/Demand Curve Growth MOC]]\n\n- The original JTBD philosophy is built upon using interviews for customer research. User interviews are important, but they‚Äôre not feasible for every company because of budget and resources. Instead, we recommend using a mix of research methods to find out your product‚Äôs job.\n| **Method**             | **Best for**                                             | **Challenges**                              |\n| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |\n| Live interviews        | Getting deeper insights                                  | Costly, time-consuming                      |\n| Surveys                | Collecting info more widely                              | Less depth and detail                       |\n| Field research         | Observing real-life behavior                             | Hard to implement                           |\n| Existing customer data | Finding commont trends among current leads and customers | Limited to users familiar with your product |\n| Market analysis        | Understanding whether competitors complete users' jobs   | Limited depth without insider knowledge     |\n\n- There are different levels of insight attained with each‚Äîso by using a balance of these methods, you‚Äôll get richer data and a more rounded understanding of the job customers are hiring for. Let‚Äôs explore each of these.\n\n## Interview prospects and customers\n- Though more time-consuming and expensive than other research methods, live interviews get more nuanced insights. You can dig deeper to find out users‚Äô authentic concerns, how they perceive existing products, and whether these products actually complete the job they‚Äôre hired for.¬†\n- Remember that the job is the centerpiece of the JTBD framework, so the goal of your interview is to uncover what exactly the customer is trying to accomplish. In other words: ==How do customers decide to solve their problem? How do they decide for or against specific solutions?==\n- Here‚Äôs¬†[a template script](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Yv5dJrmttNcx9GUS9Jii4WPc-HmzfhrGklLgxc7mm4U/edit?usp=sharing)¬†to help guide your interviews. We‚Äôve organized questions into four phases:\n\t1. **Exploring:**¬†What exactly is the problem? What conditions led to this problem?\n\t2. **Considering:**¬†What did the user do to look for a solution? What criteria did they use to judge different products?\n\t3. **Deciding:**¬†How did the user decide on hiring a specific product?\n\t4. **Consuming:**¬†How did the user make their purchase?\n- Important note:¬†As you interview users, ==focus on the¬†how, not the why.== Asking why someone behaves a certain way doesn‚Äôt lead as well to accurate answers because we tend to justify actions with new info learned later on. For less biased answers, ask how users arrived at a decision.\n\n## Survey customers\n- Surveys have less nuance than interviews, but they‚Äôre cheaper and easier to run. You can build them using¬†[Survey Monkey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/)¬†or¬†[Typeform](https://www.typeform.com/)¬†then find respondents through social media, online communities, or your existing customers.\n- **Pre-launch** companies that want to validate their market and better understand a problem should ask survey questions like:\n\t-   What is your relationship like with [topic/problem]?\n\t-   Are you using multiple products?¬†\n\t-   What‚Äôs the final outcome you‚Äôre looking for?¬†\n\t-   How important is solving this problem to you?\n- **Post-launch** companies should use surveys to find out the value customers get from their product. Ask these three questions:\n\t1. What‚Äôs the main benefit you get from our product?\n\t2. How can we improve our product for you?\n\t3. How would you feel if you could no longer use our product?\n\t\t-  Not disappointed, somewhat disappointed, very disappointed\n- Pay attention to the last question. If most people answer ‚Äúnot disappointed,‚Äù it‚Äôs a good sign that your product doesn‚Äôt quite get a job done or that the job isn‚Äôt that important to them. \n- Your goal should be to ==have more people who would be¬†_very disappointed_¬†if they could no longer use your product==‚Äîresearch shows that if 40% of users respond ‚Äúvery disappointed,‚Äù¬†[your product probably satisfies market demand](https://review.firstround.com/how-superhuman-built-an-engine-to-find-product-market-fit).\n\n## Do field research\n- People aren‚Äôt always aware of their motivations. Instead of getting someone‚Äôs thoughts about how they¬†_might_¬†behave, observe them in their natural environment to capture real user behavior.\n- Examples:\n\t- Set up screen recordings using¬†[Loom](https://www.loom.com/)¬†to observe how someone does a task online. Ask users to talk out loud through their thought process.¬†\n\t-   Use a heatmap tool like¬†[Hotjar](https://www.hotjar.com/)¬†to track how users interact with your website, like what they click on or point to with their cursor.¬†\n\t-   Find and attend industry-relevant events. Take notes on how people behave, like which booths at a conference get the most visits.\n\t-   Assemble a focus group to discuss topics relevant to your company/product. This is especially useful for B2B customers because focus groups simulate multiple stakeholders.\n\n## Review existing customer data\n- The data you already have about your customers can clue you into what job they‚Äôre hiring your product for‚Äîand whether your product is succeeding at it. This data includes:\n\t-   Customer behavior and usage data\n\t-   Notes from sales calls\n\t-   Customer support tickets and emails\n\t-   User reviews and feedback\n- Look for trends in this data, such as:\n\t-   **Who your current customers are:**¬†What kinds of customers use your product more actively? If your product is used by different types of customers, is there one industry, job title, etc. that‚Äôs more common?¬†\n\t-   **What customers are using your product for:**¬†Is it the core value prop you advertise? What features do customers use most?¬†\n\t-   **Where your product meets expectations and where it falls short:**¬†What features do users praise the most? What new features or improvements do they ask for? And what features are they most unhappy with?\n\t-   **How your product makes customers feel:**¬†What emotions do satisfied customers use to describe their experience with your product? What about unsatisfied customers?\n\n## Study the current market\n- Although you can‚Äôt tap into other companies‚Äô databases, you can use the other research methods to study your competitors:\n\t- Interview or survey people who use competitors‚Äô products. Use Slack, Facebook groups, etc. to find them.\n\t-   Observe and record competitor products in action.\n\t-  Read reviews and social media posts about your competitors.\n- The goal here: ==find out what jobs competitor products do. ==\n\t- Do they fully complete the job they‚Äôre hired for? \n\t- Is that job the same as your product‚Äôs? \n\t- Would customers fire your product to hire theirs?\n- Important note: Market analysis isn't about comparing your product‚Äôs features with another company‚Äôs and trying to imitate or outdo them. ==Doing this takes away from the user‚Äôs needs==‚Äîcompanies end up developing product features that are nice to have but irrelevant to the job.\n- Looking at other products, you may realize that your perceived competitors aren‚Äôt actually competitors because ==they‚Äôre doing a different job. ==This can help clarify your own product‚Äôs job and what exactly it‚Äôs competing against.¬†\n- Netflix CEO Reed Hastings once described how Netflix competes with not just other video networks but also playing board games and drinking wine‚Äî==any activities that help people relax (Netflix‚Äôs real job).==\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.739605357Z","tags":null},"/Sources/Demand-Curve/How-to-Identify-the-Right-Competitors-to-Study":{"title":"How to Identify the Right Competitors to Study","content":"[[Atlas/Maps/Demand Curve Growth MOC]]\n\n- **Talk to your leads and customers.**¬†Ask what other companies they‚Äôve considered or used.\n    - Important note: It‚Äôs possible your leads will name companies that aren‚Äôt actually competitors. This might mean that your brand positioning or value props aren‚Äôt very clear. You may be emphasizing the wrong features, or you might be pitching to the wrong audience.\n-  **Look through online directories like Crunchbase, Product Hunt, and G2.**¬†Search by topic/category and keep narrowing down to find both direct and indirect competitors.¬†\n-   **Break down your user‚Äôs workflow.**¬†Look at how your target audience handles the specific problem your product solves. (Get insight into this process from doing market and customer research.) Break this workflow into smaller tasks and different products that complete each task. Here‚Äôs an example of how that might look for someone writing an article.\n\t- ![[Extras/Media/Images/Example User Workflow.png]]\n\t- The products that appear most frequently or carry out the same tasks as yours are probably competitors.\n- **Google your target keywords.**¬†See what websites rank highly for your target keywords in Google‚Äôs search results. Chances are you‚Äôll find both direct and indirect competitors, although there may also be a few companies from a completely different niche.\n\t- For example, if your company sells a productivity app that tracks time, searching ‚Äútime tracking software‚Äù shows other companies doing the same thing, like Toggl and My Hours. The results also show roundup posts listing other potential competitors.","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.739605357Z","tags":null},"/Sources/Demand-Curve/Introduction-to-Branding":{"title":"Introduction to Branding","content":"## Questions answered in this module\n-   What is branding?\n-   Why is branding important even for early-stage companies?\n-   What are some successful examples of branding?\n-   How do companies define their brands?\n\n- No matter what product or service you sell, you also sell an experience‚Äîand ==branding is what creates this experience.== Think of this as ==the sum of all the touchpoints between your company and its customers.==\n- Consider how people share photos of their Starbucks drinks on social media. Starbucks doesn‚Äôt only sell coffee; it sells a trendy self-image. People order from Starbucks to project this identity, even if its coffee isn‚Äôt the best. In fact, in a¬†[blind taste test by Consumer Reports magazine](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2009/06/could-mcdonalds-really-beat-starbucks/18956/), McDonald‚Äôs coffee beat Starbucks‚Äîbut that doesn‚Äôt stop Starbucks from being the most popular coffee chain in the world.\n- Building a brand is ultimately about ==shaping perceptions of your company‚Äôs value.==\n- With a poor brand, customers won‚Äôt want any affiliation with your company. They might see your product as not being worth their money, or worse, a scam. But done well, good branding does the opposite‚Äîit makes your product desirable, with customers naturally spreading the word and even lining up for more from your business.\n- Our [[Five Fits Framework]] includes brand because it plays a crucial role in determining your ideal growth strategy as well as your overall growth potential. Brand guides how you convey your company to the world and much more, like:\n\t-   How you should build your product\n\t-   Which pricing model(s) are optimal\n\t-   Which growth channels you should (and shouldn‚Äôt) use\n- **In other words, brand touches every aspect of your growth engine.**\n- In this unit, we‚Äôll explain why brand is a secret weapon for growth. You‚Äôll learn about the key components of a successful brand strategy and how to define your own brand for stand-out results.","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.739605357Z","tags":null},"/Sources/Demand-Curve/Introduction-to-Competitor-Research":{"title":"Introduction to Competitor Research","content":"[[Atlas/Maps/Demand Curve Growth MOC]]\n\n## Questions answered in this module\n-   Why should I do competitor research?\n-   Which competitors should I study?\n-   How do I find the right competitors to study?\n-   How do I leverage competitor research for growth insights?\n\n## Overview\n- Many founders think competitor research is important for staying ahead of rival companies. That‚Äôs true‚Äîbut early stage companies don‚Äôt need to worry about losing customers ==if they‚Äôve never had them in the first place.¬†==\n- Instead, competitor research matters because ==you can use it to¬†_grow_¬†your business.== Specifically, you can use competitor research to:\n\t- **Validate your growth strategy.**¬†Researching companies similar to yours can help fast-track major growth decisions. Chances are, whatever business model or acquisition channel works for them could work for you.\n\t- **Disrupt the market.**¬†By studying established competitors, you can find new ways and opportunities to compete against them. Consider how Netflix went from mail-order DVD rentals to online streaming to edge out Blockbuster.\n\t- **Guide your product messaging and value props.**¬†When you understand how competitors market their brand and product to customers, you‚Äôll be better able to differentiate yours.¬†\n\t- **Identify and vet growth experiments.**¬†Source new growth ideas based on what you observe in your competitors‚Äô strategies. Depending on the competitor, you may have more certainty that a specific tactic will or won‚Äôt work.\n- You can, of course, also leverage competitor research for product insights. However, since our program focuses on acquiring customers, we won‚Äôt dive into competitor research for product development. Instead, we‚Äôll focus on ==how to find the right competitors for growth insights and how to actually do the research.==\n\n## Why do competitor research?\n- Well-established competitors have tested maybe dozens of iterations to find the best ways to grow their companies. You can get these learnings in a much shorter time if you know where to look. Even better, doing this research is relatively cheap, making it a low-cost way to get growth guidance and source ideas.\n- That said, there‚Äôs one big caveat: **Competitor research shouldn‚Äôt replace your own experimentation and customer research.**¬†No matter how similar your product and business model are, there‚Äôs no guarantee that what works for one company will work for yours.\n- Not to mention, you can‚Äôt perfectly recreate all growth strategies, especially from older companies. Many businesses found early success using techniques and ad channels that are much more saturated today.¬†\n- But the goal of competitor research isn‚Äôt to clone someone else‚Äôs successful business strategy. It‚Äôs to ==understand at a macro level what worked for companies similar to yours so that you can better prioritize the growth channels with the most potential.== While you can‚Äôt replicate your competitors‚Äô results, you can get more conviction about which strategic direction to move in.\n- One final note before we dive in: ==Don‚Äôt spend too much time doing this research.== Take notes on your findings, but don‚Äôt put together a comprehensive research report. Instead, take the next step and act on your findings.","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.739605357Z","tags":null},"/Sources/Demand-Curve/Introduction-to-Market-and-Customer-Research":{"title":"Introduction to Market and Customer Research","content":"[[Atlas/Maps/Demand Curve Growth MOC]]\n\n## Questions answered in this module\n\n-   Why do market research and customer research matter?\n-   How do I figure out who my target customers are?\n-   What are the methods for doing market and customer research?\n-   How do I perform customer research for my product?\n\n## Why you need to understand your market\n- New founders often start out thinking, ‚ÄúOur market is huge!

This is where value props come into play.\n- From now on, you can think about value props as¬†_copy ideas._¬†Whenever you‚Äôre stuck for copy ideas, revisit your value props.\n- Your first step to creating effective social ads and landing pages is to identify value props: ==What does your product do to improve the lives of your target audience?‚Äå==\n\n## Developing value props\n### Step 1: Identify your value props\n- To identify your product or service value props, create a 3-column chart.\n- Here‚Äôs the process:\n\t1.  List ==all the¬†**_bad (non-desirable) alternative_**¬†solutions== people resort to when they don't have you. And describe what makes each one bad. \n\t\t1. For example, if they don't have your¬†_fast_¬†car, they have to get to work in a slow car. What makes that bad is how much more time you waste in traffic. Or less time spent with your family.\n\t2. With each bad alternative, write ==one¬†**_value prop_**==¬†that highlights how your product offers a better solution to improve on that bad alternative. \n\t\t1. For example, your fast car¬†_gets you to work quickly_. The value prop wording should encapsulate the main high-level idea. Don't worry too much about the details yet (we'll dive into that later). For example, the value prop could be \"fastest consumer car \", and not \"X horsepower\".\n\t3. Finally, list a ==lucrative¬†**_customer persona_**==¬†in a third column: identify the persona that cares most about this particular value prop. And bullet point the top two reasons why they care about it.\n- Examples of value props:\n\t- For a fantasy football (soccer) app: ![[Extras/Media/Images/Fantasy Soccer App Value Props.png]]\n\t- For an online matcha shop: ![[Extras/Media/Images/Online Matcha Shop Value Props.png]]\n- You may walk away with a bunch of value props at first. This is good. It‚Äôs always easier to subtract than to add. Once you feel you‚Äôve exhausted your options, you‚Äôll want to reduce your list of value props in column two to those that are most appealing to your top personas.‚Äå\n- The leftover value props will be the focus of your ads.\n- Ideally, you'll walk away with ==at least five value props== to build ad copy from.\n\n### Step 2‚Äå: Identify the problems your value props solve\n- Now that you've identified your value props, it's time to refine them so that they serve as a foundation for your ad copy. To do this for our clients, we use a spreadsheet to flesh them out.\n- Continuing from our examples:\n\t- Fantasy soccer app: ![[Extras/Media/Images/Fantasy Soccer App Problems.png]]\n\t- Online matcha shop: ![[Extras/Media/Images/Online Matcha Shop Problems.png]]\n- ‚ÄåFirst, it‚Äôs important to remember that ==you want to use the language your audience would use.== This is where customer surveys become invaluable.‚Äå\n- Second, ==skip the jargon== (exception: if you‚Äôre in a super-niche market, it‚Äôs sometimes OK to use industry jargon).\n- When you fill out this spreadsheet, ==do it as though you were speaking directly to your audience.==\n- Begin by listing out the value props you‚Äôve identified in the left-hand column. Then, fill out the following columns:\n#### Problem\n- Get super specific about ==the moment== your target audience has¬†**urgently experienced the problem**. This should be written in ==past tense.‚Äå==\n- This is especially important if you're a B2B product.\n\t- Most often, the problem involves ==wasting substantial time or money.==\n\t- Some examples:\n\t\t-   Your company just lost a lot of money\n\t\t-   A key employee just quit\n\t\t-   A relationship just got ruined\n- If you're B2C, you might be a \"vitamin\" instead of a \"painkiller\". ==This means there might not be a burning problem to solve.== That's OK. ==Focus on the solution and benefits section more.==\n- At Demand Curve, we‚Äôll sometimes¬†_get on the phone and talk to each other_¬†as if we were a member of our target audience. We interview each other to flesh out the pain and urgency we feel.\n#### Implications\n- Drill into the bad things that happen if someone hits that problem.\n- What happens¬†_after_¬†the key employee quits? What¬†_can't you do_¬†because you're wasting tons of time? Does your company risk going out of business? Do you fear for your job?\n- We call this \"twisting the knife\". ==Once you've found an entry point with the problem, drill into that pain more and more.==\n- As you write out the implications of the problem, ==find the specific person whose butt is on the line when things fail.== Get super specific, down to the job title. They should be losing massive amounts of money, time, or reputation.\n- **Examples:**\n\t- If your company loses a lot of money, people are going to get fired. Which means your job as the VP of Finance is at stake.\n\t-   If your key employee quits, it's going to take months to retrain a new hire. And that costs $80,000.\n\t-   If you're wasting 20 hours a week on meaningless tasks, you can't ship as quickly. Which means that, as the CEO, you're going to miss investor goals and lose funding.\n\n#### Solution\n- How your product solves the problem.\n- **Examples:**\n\t- Ruby Plants uses machine learning to grow plants\n\t-   Our feedback tool keeps track of employees who are flight risks\n\t-   Sentry integrates with every type of codebase\n#### Benefits\n- Flip the implications of the problem around and talk about the¬†_great things that naturally come from the solution_.‚Äå\n- **Example copy:**\n\t-  Growing plants with machine-learning makes them¬†_five times cheaper_. So you save money.\n\t-  Keep employees around. Saving you months of time hiring and training.\n\t-   When every codebase can integrate, you don't write any custom code. So you have time to push new features.\n\n## Don'ts / Common Pitfalls\n### Implications that aren't tied to the problem\n- ‚ÄåFor example, if your customer's problem is \"you just missed your taxi\", an implication is¬†_not_¬†\"you always miss your taxis.\" That's a separate problem and value prop.\n- An implication¬†_would_¬†be \"you missed an important sales meeting\" ‚Äî which missing your taxi directly caused.‚Äå\n### Avoid industry-wide trends\n- Don't use language like \"80% of office managers don't know about plant-based snacks\" or \"AI hasn't reached farming yet\". That's not a specific problem that your customer faces.\n- Instead, talk about your customer. For example, \"your key employee just had an allergic reaction to gluten\" or \"you have thousands of workers manually checking your chicken eggs.\"","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.739605357Z","tags":null},"/Sources/Demand-Curve/JBTD-Framework":{"title":"JBTD Framework","content":"[[Atlas/Maps/Demand Curve Growth MOC]]\n\n- There are many ways to structure your customer research, but we recommend using the¬†**jobs-to-be-done (JTBD) framework**. \n- According to this framework:\n\t-   Customers are users that hire products for a specific job.¬†\n\t-   Products help complete a user‚Äôs job.\n\t-   If the product does the job well, users will hire that product again. Otherwise, they‚Äôll fire it and hire a different product.\n- According to the JTBD framework, companies should ask, ==‚ÄúWhat job are people hiring my product for?‚Äù== This is a customer-centered approach, where companies design products around ==meeting users‚Äô real-life needs, aka jobs.==\n- Companies oftentimes use their competitors to guide product development. They ask, ‚ÄúWhat would make my product better than the competitors?‚Äù Example: local hotels try to outdo one another by providing better amenities and customer service.¬†\n- But, consider Airbnb. Part of its success comes not from offering better amenities or customer service than hotels, but by excelling at a job hotels don‚Äôt complete: providing stays with more local personality.\n- Similarly, other major companies design their products around ==jobs specific to their target users‚Äô needs‚Äînot in comparison to their competition.== Here are a few examples:\n\t- Robinhood: Make investing easy and accessible for retail consumers\n\t-   Zoom: Virtually connect remote teams\n\t-   Warby Parker: Make stylish designer eyewear affordable\n- The JTBD framework further helps to understand what exactly the job is so you can build a better product.\n- For¬†**pre-launch**¬†companies, that means using this framework to ==validate market demand.==¬†\n\t-   What problems do people encounter and hire products for?\n\t-   What job needs to be done that no good products exist for? (DIY solutions by users are often a sign of unfulfilled jobs.)\n- For¬†**post-launch**¬†companies, the JTBD framework helps pinpoint ==where and how your product provides the most value.¬†==\n\t-   What exactly is the job your product should be hired for?\n\t-   And how can you optimize your product for that job?\n\n## JTBD Statements\n- The JTBD framework defines your ideal audience as more than a list of demographics. Indeed, categorizing users based on certain traits can be helpful, but it also limits your understanding of who benefits from your product.\n- So who is your ideal audience? These are the users who:\n\t-   Face the problem your product addresses\n\t-   Would pay to solve this problem\n\t-   Are unhappy with a competitor\n\t-   Have an urgent need to switch to you\n- Here‚Äôs a framework for identifying your ideal audience based on how users view your problem:\n\t1.  **Urgency:**¬†How quickly do they want to solve it?¬†\n\t2.  **Agency:**¬†How willing are they to solve it?¬†\n\t3.  **Ability:**¬†How able are they to solve it?\n- Your ideal users have¬†==high urgency and agency==¬†and¬†==low ability==. They can‚Äôt solve their problem on their own and are motivated to solve it quickly.\n- Take Shopify for example. \n\t- All kinds of businesses use Shopify‚Äîthere isn‚Äôt just one demographic or industry it‚Äôs useful for. But its ideal audience is mostly made up of small businesses and entrepreneurs who don‚Äôt have tech backgrounds and want to easily sell products online. These users:\n\t\t- Want to begin selling goods online asap (high urgency)\n\t\t- Have the means and desire to invest in an all-in-one selling platform (high agency)\n\t\t- Don‚Äôt know how to set up an ecommerce business on their own (low ability)\n\t- Compare that to less-than-ideal customers, who include:\n\t\t- People who only want to sell products locally (low urgency)\n\t\t- Casual hobbyists and craftspeople‚Äîto them, selling things is more for fun (low agency)\n\t\t- Experienced programmers who can create an online shop from scratch (high ability)\n\n## Job requirements\n- Using the JTBD framework, the product revolves around the job, which is a task with both functional and emotional job aspects:\n\t-   **Functional:**¬†The practical physical requirements that get a job done\n\t- **Emotional:**¬†The underlying desires and emotions required for jobs to feel complete\n- You must define both to understand your job that needs to be done.¬†\n- Consider DoorDash.\n\t- **Functional:** Quickly order food delivery online.¬†\n\t- Emotional: Convenience and security, thanks to the app interface and contactless payments. Many people don't want to call a restaurant or interact with a delivery person.\n- Your product ==must fulfill both functional and emotional jobs that need to be done==‚Äîor customers are less likely to hire it.\n\n## A real-life example of the JTBD framework\n- The company Twine creates software to help companies stay organized. In 2019, it seemed to be doing well‚Äîit had happy customers and consistent growth.¬†\n- But despite Twine‚Äôs ‚Äúsuccess,‚Äù its team struggled to focus because customers were using the product in many different ways. This made it difficult to decide which features were most compelling and which new product features should be prioritized.\n- To determine what exactly to focus on, Twine‚Äôs team¬†[used the JTBD framework](https://medium.com/@Rob_McW/how-jobs-to-be-done-won-us-our-dream-customer-26cb8e518605). They:\n\t- Interviewed their most active users\n\t-  Studied sales call notes and CRM data\n\t-  Analyzed customer support tickets and app usage\n- This helped Twine‚Äôs team find where customers found the most value in their product. It also uncovered how customers viewed their own needs and the kind of language they used to describe the product‚Äîwhich Twine quickly made changes to accommodate in both its product and marketing.¬†\n- Today, Twine focuses on the most important jobs its users want to hire for: ==centralizing team info, integrating tools, and connecting different people.==","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.739605357Z","tags":null},"/Sources/Demand-Curve/Leveraging-Your-Market-and-Customer-Research":{"title":"Leveraging Your Market and Customer Research","content":"[[Atlas/Maps/Demand Curve Growth MOC]]\n\n- Once you‚Äôve collected market and customer data, transform your research into actionable insights to begin making optimizations. Here are three ways to leverage your data:¬†\n\t-   Customer personas\n\t-   The customer/market profile\n\t-   The customer journey map\n- These are the deliverables that result from all the research you did in this chapter. With these in hand, you can begin making decisions‚Äîand getting the rest of your team on board.\n\n## Customer personas\n- **Customer personas**¬†are fictional user profiles that represent your ideal audience and are based on your research. While the other frameworks listed below can also accomplish this, we‚Äôll focus mostly on personas in this program. You can create them using¬†[our template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16zR3KDi1CVFxvBgDuz21EKlvYKkSiYgLTkiXinqMXMw/edit?usp=sharing).\n- Personas ==tell the story of different types of customers at the moment they encounter a problem==‚Äîaka the job that they need to hire your product for. Giving detail to these stories helps to identify customer pain points and personalize your marketing for better performance.\n- A persona for the online learning platform Skillshare might sound like this:\n\t- _Emily is a high school teacher who likes to dabble in art. She‚Äôs interested in honing her graphic design skills, with the goal of starting a freelance business later on. However, she's reluctant to take classes that require meeting in person or at certain times because of her work schedule._\n- Customer personas help you understand why someone considers your product‚Äîand the potential objections that you should proactively address. For example, the Emily persona tells Skillshare‚Äôs team to emphasize how their online classes are self-paced.\n- Even without doing customer research, you can brainstorm potential personas for your company. One of the best ways to come up with these personas is by looking at your current customers.\n- Identify your top customers and then drill into who they are. (If you have customer email addresses, you can use services like Clearbit Enrichment to input their email and collect more information about them and their company.) For example:\n\t- What's their job title?¬†\n\t-  Are they at a certain level of funding?¬†\n\t-  Did they experience any major life events recently?\n\t- Did someone find you through a support forum because your competitor's software wasn't cutting it?\n- Look for patterns and trends in your data. Then bucket your customers based on what you learn‚Äîeach group should get its own persona.\n- Important note: Your current customer data makes a great starting point for creating personas, but you should still do market and customer research. This way, you won‚Äôt leave out any currently untapped segments of your audience.\n\n## Customer/market profile\n- The¬†**customer/market profile**¬†is a concept we‚Äôve developed to ==aggregate all the important aspects of your market research==, including:\n\t-   The job that needs to be done (the problem your product solves)\n\t-   Your customer persona\n\t-   Your customer‚Äôs buying power and constraints\n\t-   How competitors and alternative solutions stack up against your product\n- Here‚Äôs an example of one we created for Demand Curve:\n![[Extras/Media/Images/Customer Profile Example.png]]\n- Use our¬†[template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RXw5kErctxRhrK4q5p0Wm1mUAH-2dYSg1ieMTaVtocM/edit?usp=sharing)¬†to create your own. Share it with your team and help them understand who you‚Äôre building your products for.\n\n## Customer journey map\n- Many people think of the customer journey as a linear jump from point A to point B: someone sees an ad and then buys your product. In reality, this path zigzags, and it can be especially long for B2B companies.¬†\n- A¬†**customer journey map**¬†is a ==visual representation of the customer‚Äôs process to hire your product to get a job done.== Think of it as a timeline of the customer‚Äôs decision-making process.\n- It includes the same four stages used in the JTBD interview process, as well as a loyalty stage that comes last and focuses on what‚Äôs done to retain customers.\n- Here‚Äôs¬†[a template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O8eEGWE5XWtLNdz4t2JxIRjMlYCU9XdXu8lrYK4EOa4/edit?usp=sharing)¬†we‚Äôve created.\n![[Extras/Media/Images/Customer Map Template.png]]\n- Use this map to track:\n\t-  How customers‚Äô goals and activities change throughout their buying journey\n\t-  How customers feel at different points in their buying journey\n\t- Important touchpoints between you and your customers, which either move users forward or end their journey\n- Besides describing what customers are thinking and feeling throughout their buying journey, the customer journey map also ==accounts for how your company behaves in each stage.== The point is that, just like your customers, your company shouldn‚Äôt be doing the same thing (like only sending discount codes) throughout the journey.\n- Look for pain points in each part of the customer journey, not just when users are facing a problem for the first time. ==The goal is to understand how your company and product fit into the larger context of a customer‚Äôs life.==","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.739605357Z","tags":null},"/Sources/Demand-Curve/Pricing-Bonus-Tactics":{"title":"Pricing Bonus Tactics","content":"- Now that you have the pricing fundamentals in place, here are a few additional tactics.

They help with conversion by reducing signup friction and getting users to experience your product‚Äôs JTBD faster.\n- There are plenty of reasons why both are popular.\n\t- Free trials and freemium provide an opportunity to hook a prospect by delivering value before any money changes hands. When done right, by the time the user starts paying, ==they 1) understand how the product solves their problem, and 2) have developed a habit around product use.==\n\t- By analyzing data from thousands of SaaS and subscription companies, the ProfitWell team¬†[found that](https://www.profitwell.com/recur/all/every-company-freemium?__hstc=263140243.baa485dd7fc811819d62d18e6c4ba6ae.1638398577353.1638816124634.1638821469777.4\u0026__hssc=263140243.1.1638821469777\u0026__hsfp=999455785)¬†freemium cuts CAC by nearly half, and free trials had 15% lower CAC.\n\t- The ProfitWell team also found an almost 20% improvement in net retention and a twice-as-good NPS score for freemium vs. non-free.\n- Those are all encouraging points, but they don‚Äôt mean you should definitely have a free offering. Freemium is tough to get right. ==Unless you understand your value metric really well, you run the risk of giving away either too much or not enough value in your product‚Äôs free version.== It takes a lot of data to know how to strike the right balance.\n- Our upcoming discussion of model-market, model-product, and model-channel fits will help you determine whether freemium is right for your startup, but some indicators that it‚Äôs a good match are:\n\t- **Low product friction:**¬†Your product is easy to get started in and experience value from.\n\t- **Product stickiness:**¬†The value of your product increases the longer someone uses it, making them less likely to leave for a competitor‚Äîand giving you more time to convert them to paid.\n\t- **Network effects:**¬†Your product‚Äôs value increases as more people use it. Both stickiness and network effects help maximize user retention. And the longer someone is retained, the more likely they are to upgrade eventually.\n\t- **Product virality:**¬†Your product has¬†[pull virality](https://learn.demandcurve.com/courses/take/full-course/texts/29374431-pull-virality)¬†and word-of-mouth potential.\n\t- **Self-service:**¬†You don‚Äôt need to put many resources toward supporting self-service users. They can experience product value without extensive training or support.\n\t- **Market competition:**¬†You‚Äôre offering an alternative to a well-entrenched competitor or introducing a totally new concept. Both might benefit from a freebie nudge.\n\t- **Market size:**¬†Your product would be able to convert enough people to make the economics work. Which means either a bigger market or a higher conversion rate. Market size is important for freemium because 1) you need a big market to truly go viral, and 2) freemium has a lower purchase rate than higher-touch models like sales.\n- Even if all the above are true, you should still do research to validate that a freemium version or free trial is right for your business. That might mean ==adding relevant questions to your survey.== We‚Äôve included a few examples in the project doc.\n- Also, those promising stats from ProfitWell notwithstanding, there¬†_is_¬†the potential for freemium / free trials to result in an increase in CAC and drop in retention. If you decide to offer freemium or a free trial, ==make sure it works with your CAC and ARPU and provides a clear conversion path.== (We‚Äôll discuss CAC and ARPU calculations in an upcoming section of this module.)\n- For helpful conversion benchmarks for freemium vs. free trial, check out¬†[this research by Ada Chen Rekhi](https://adachen.com/freemium-and-free-trial-conversion-benchmarks-9fab38d096da).\n\n## Upgrades and add-ons\n- A common practice for SaaS tiered pricing is to ==integrate in-app upgrade triggers, for increased customer lifetime value (LTV).== If a user is already in a product, and they run up against product limitations that would be resolved by an upgrade, they might go ahead and upgrade as an organic part of their user experience.\n- Some options for SaaS triggers:\n\t- When a user attempts to access a higher-tier feature\n\t- A banner or popup\n\t- In-app CTAs and options\n\t- Upgrades/add-ons at checkout\n- This is the same concept as upselling or cross-selling in ecommerce.\n\t- **Upselling:**¬†selling a higher-end version of a product\n\t- **Cross-selling:**¬†selling a related item\n- Two common places for ecommerce upsells and cross-sells are on product pages and in carts.\n- **Tip:**¬†Set up ==conversion tracking== for any triggers you use, to see which ones result in upgrades.\n\n## Discounts and incentives\n- **Rule of thumb:**¬†Early-stage startups should avoid offering discounts. They can easily become a crutch or a Band-aid that‚Äôs covering up‚Äîand failing to solve‚Äîa bigger problem.\n- Often, that problem is wrong pricing‚Äîeither because prospects don‚Äôt understand your product value, or they¬†_do_¬†understand it but can‚Äôt buy your product (e.g., because of a conversion or funnel issue), don‚Äôt feel the urgent need to, or don‚Äôt think your price is justified.\n- Plus, discounts can have a drastic effect on your product‚Äôs perceived value:\n\t- If you discount your product too¬†_much_, your market might think your product is cheap.\n\t- If you discount your product too¬†_often_, they might start to expect a discount. And they might end up either waiting until a discount becomes available‚Äîthe opposite of the urgency you want‚Äîor flat-out refusing to buy your product without a discount.\n- Example: Apple Store shoppers don‚Äôt typically buy based on discounts, but J.C. Penney shoppers do. The department store chain found that out the hard way when they brought an Apple exec in. He got rid of J.C. Penney‚Äôs discounts‚Äîand sales tanked.\n- If you‚Äôre considering experimenting with discounts and incentives, here are some guidelines to help you get started:\n\n## Dynamic pricing\n\n## Pricing page tips","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.739605357Z","tags":null},"/Sources/Demand-Curve/Pricing-Overview":{"title":"Pricing Overview","content":"- Here are four common pricing mistakes we‚Äôve seen startups make:\n\t1.  **Pricing too low**‚Äîwhich can add up to a lot of missed revenue\n\t2.  **Charging the wrong way**, e.g., charging per seat when what your users¬†_want_¬†to pay for is something else entirely\n\t3.  **Guessing on pricing.** An¬†[analysis](https://www.inc.com/scott-maxwell/solving-the-startup-pricing-dilemma.html)¬†from Openview found that over 40% of seed-stage startups have never tested their pricing or conducted willingness-to-pay market research.\n\t4.  **Leaving pricing until the last minute.** In the Openview analysis, half of startups considered pricing only in the immediate leadup to launch, not sooner.\n- You can avoid those mistakes by taking a strategic approach to pricing. It doesn‚Äôt have to be‚Äîand truly shouldn‚Äôt be‚Äîa last-minute guessing game. Instead, your pricing should be as well-researched and well-planned as your other fits.\n- A strategic approach to pricing entails determining, early in your startup‚Äôs life:\n\t1.  **What to charge for.**¬†We call this your¬†**value metric**. Sometimes it‚Äôs obvious (an umbrella shop charges per umbrella), and sometimes it‚Äôs much trickier to pin down, as we‚Äôll get into.\n\t2.  **How to charge.**¬†We‚Äôll discuss five pricing structures: usage-based, tiered, flat-rate, per-user, and variable.\n\t3.  **How much to charge.**¬†And we‚Äôll go over the three main methods for setting your price: value-based, cost-plus, and competitor-based pricing.\n- Before we dive in, there are two essential points to consider as you prepare and launch your pricing strategy:\n\t- **Your pricing isn‚Äôt set in stone.**¬†It should evolve as your business does, and as you collect more data and insights.\n\t-   **Your customers aren‚Äôt just making the¬†_buying_¬†decisions.**¬†Their input should also inform your¬†_pricing_¬†decisions.\n\n## Your pricing isn't set in stone\n- Price affects everything. \n\t- Of course, it affects the business side of things: your revenue, the expenses you can afford, how many conversions you get, how many customers you retain. \n\t- It affects your market share and brand perception‚Äîfor instance, pricing too low can devalue your product in your audience‚Äôs eyes. \n\t- And it directly affects the durability of your startup.\n- Yes, it‚Äôs important to get it right. But don‚Äôt sweat it. For two reasons:\n\t- One,¬†**your pricing doesn‚Äôt have to be perfect**. It just has to be in the right range.\n\t- And two,¬†**pricing isn‚Äôt fixed**. You can always revisit and revise your pricing strategy. We recommend assessing your pricing every three months to see what‚Äôs working and where there are opportunities for improvement. As you revisit and revise, your price will get closer to perfect.\n- For now, we‚Äôll get you to a solid initial pricing strategy.\n\n## Involve your customers in your pricing decision matrix\n- The third mistake we mentioned earlier is ‚Äúguessing on pricing.‚Äù To avoid that mistake, it‚Äôs important to engage your customers in the pricing-strategy process.\n- Here‚Äôs how Tyler Gaffney, the CEO of ZenHub,¬†[put it](https://review.firstround.com/pricing-lessons-from-working-with-30-seed-and-series-a-b2b-startups): ‚ÄúPeople get caught up behind the computer screen trying to figure pricing out, or doing a ton of benchmarking and research. ==Instead, they should be having conversations. All the answers are in your customers‚Äô heads.==‚Äù\n- As you‚Äôll see, the project for this module involves putting together a plan for how to get those answers. What that means is either talking to your customers or surveying them. By the end of this module, you‚Äôll have a survey or interview template ready to use.\n- **Surveying or interviewing customers is a critical step in building a pricing strategy that should not be skipped.**¬†It doesn‚Äôt matter how well you¬†_think_¬†you know your audience. True customer insights can only come directly from them.\n- The first pricing insight to gather is what your value metric should be.","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.739605357Z","tags":null},"/Sources/Demand-Curve/The-Five-Fits-Framework":{"title":"The Five Fits Framework","content":"[[Atlas/Maps/Demand Curve Growth MOC]]\n\n- Growth isn't just about marketing channels, conversion rate optimization, or any other stand-alone function. Growth is ==holistic==‚Äîit comes when the individual parts of your startup are working together, in harmony.\n- This is easier said than done. That's why we use something called the **Five Fits Framework** to map exactly ==how the different components of a company \"fit\" together to drive (or hinder) growth.==\n- Founders are often floored by how powerful this framework is for decision making. The Five Fits Framework allows you to:\n\t- Figure out how your startup will grow.\n\t- Skip months or years of trial and error by investing in the right strategy early on.\n\t- Reverse-engineer how competitors and other companies grow (and see why some are able to grow and others aren't).\n\t- Identify when, why, and if you should make a change within your startup, and how to run experiments with purpose.\n- Your foundational fits will set you up for success or failure down the road.\n- **It won't matter how hard you work or how clever your tactics are. If your fits are broken, growth will be incredibly hard.**\n\n## What is the [[Five Fits Framework]]?\n- There are two examples of \"fits.\"\n\t- You've probably heard of the concept of \"[[Product-Market Fit]]\": when your product aligns with the needs of a market. \n\t- You may even be familiar with the concept of \"[[Channel-Product Fit]]\": when the channel you use to acquire customers works well with the product you're selling. \n- The team at ed-tech company Reforge took these concepts a step further by explaining that there are four fits that determine the ==growth potential of a product.== We've built on their framework and added a fifth component (brand). Here are all five:\n\t1.  **Your market:**¬†whom you choose to serve\n\t2.  **Your product:**¬†what you sell\n\t3.  **Your business model:**¬†how you make money\n\t4.  **Your brand:**¬†how you present yourself to your market and the world\n\t5.  **Your acquisition channel:**¬†how you get new customers\n- Each component has a ==direct relationship== with the others.\n\t- For example, you might have the best product, wealthiest market, most attractive brand, and highest-margin business model. But if you can't figure out a way to consistently and repeatedly acquire new customers, your startup will likely fail.\n\t- We use the term \"fit\" to describe the ==relationship between each of the five key components.==\n\n- Let's take a look at how the five fits work together. In the rest of this article, we‚Äôll go through how market relates to each of the other four components. \n\t- We‚Äôll look at how market fits with product (Market-Product Fit), model (Market-Model Fit), brand (Market-Brand Fit), and channel (Market-Channel Fit). \n\t- We‚Äôll then consider the relationships between product and channel (Product-Channel Fit) and model and channel (Model-Channel Fit). \n\t- Each fit relationship is a testament to just how intertwined marketing is with every other element of your business and its ecosystem. Any fit that‚Äôs not a strong one reduces the chances of growth and success.\n![[Extras/Media/Images/Five Fits Framework.png]]\n\n## Market-product fit\n- **Definition: how your market fits with your product‚Äôs business model**\n- Your market will also dictate your pricing and business model, and vice versa.\n- There are two major ==business-model factors== we like to focus on:\n\t- **How *much* you charge:**¬†What is the lifetime value or average revenue per year each customer generates?\n\t- ***How* and *when* you charge:**¬†Do you charge a monthly subscription? Do charge a one-time, upfront payment? Or do you offer a free trial or freemium option?\n- Inevitably, your business model will cause friction between your business and your customers. Your goal is to minimize that friction.\n\n### How much you charge \u0026 market size\n- First, we need to look at the relationship between how much you charge and the size of your market. If your goal is to build a massive company, ==you're unlikely to succeed if you're targeting a small market and charging a small amount.==\n- This diagram from founder and investor¬†[Christoph Janz](https://christophjanz.blogspot.com/2019/04/five-years-later-five-ways-to-build-100.html)¬†demonstrates our point. There's a ==tradeoff== between the ==number of customers you need to acquire== and the ==price you're able to charge.==\n![[Extras/Media/Images/5 Ways to Build a 100M Saas Business.png]]\n- If you have a ==small market size AND low average annual revenue per customer==, that's a market-model fit issue (especially if your goal is to build a large company). \n\t- This seems like an obvious concept, but it's something startups often get wrong. \n\t- That's likely because they think ==their market is bigger than it really is==, and/or they think ==they'll be able to charge more than they really can.==\n\n### Buying power and willingness to pay\n- Another critical concept: The relationship between your market's buying power/willingness to pay and how much you charge. \n- Your market may desperately want your product, but if they simply don't have the budget, then nothing else matters. ==You must adapt your model for your market's buying power.¬†==\n- On the flip side, you may be targeting a market with deep pockets, but it's their willingness to pay that will determine how much you can actually charge. ==How much do they need and value your product?==\n\n### How and when you charge\n- Finally,¬†_how_¬†you charge your customers is important. Some products are totally free to use (Twitter); others offer a freemium plan (Grammarly and Spotify); some offer monthly or annual subscriptions (Netflix); and some require big one-time payments (buying a car). Each model has its own level of friction.\n- ==The lower the buying power and willingness to pay, the more friction you'll create by requiring big, upfront payments.== You'd likely find more success by lowering your prices, while simultaneously using a low-friction model like freemium or subscription.\n- Alternatively, if your market¬†_does_¬†have high buying power and willingness to pay, ==you can employ a higher-friction model==, such as six-figure annual contracts or big one-time payments.\n\n## Market-model fit\n- **Definition: how your market fits with your product‚Äôs brand**\n- A \"market\" is a group of individuals who have certain commonalities. ==A strong brand appeals to those commonalities.==\n- **We define \"brand\" as how you communicate with your market**. This includes colors, typography, design style, imagery, and the language you use.\n\t- Sure, you make the creative decisions. But ==your brand is ultimately¬†_your market's perception_¬†of your startup. ==\n\t- What do your brand elements, and your brand as a whole, make people think‚Äîand feel?\n- Those kinds of connotations can be extremely powerful. \n\t- Think about your own favorite brand. Why do you like it? Chances are, the number one reason is that you love the product. \n\t- But right below that, you may realize how much you love the brand. And maybe the brand is what made you want to use the product in the first place. Maybe you felt a special connection with it because of how it looked and sounded.\n\t- (This thought exercise applies to music too. Sure, you might love Beyonc√©‚Äôs music [her product] but for most people, it‚Äôs who she is and what she stands for [her brand] that lead to Beyhive membership. Her market loves her brand.)\n\n### Example of market-brand fit: **Betterment**\n- Let's look at how Betterment, an investing and savings app, was able to find market-brand fit. We'll focus on the language they use in their communications and marketing.\n- Betterment had to overcome a key emotional hurdle: People are intimidated by personal finance. They're skeptical of companies trying to manage their money.\n- So they were intentional in how they crafted their messaging. They kept it ==professional and friendly==, using ==approachable language== like \"meet the app\" and \"inspiration.\"\n- If Betterment's brand were silly, unprofessional, or unfocused, they'd have a hard time winning the trust of their market.\n![[Extras/Media/Images/Betterment Example.png]]\n\n### Brand and other fits\n- Your brand needs to align with your market. But it's also critical that your brand align with the other three components:\n\t- **Brand-model fit:**¬†E.g., Mercedes-Benz is a premium brand. They don't sell cars for $15k. If your brand is highly exclusive, your business model shouldn't diminish that exclusive nature.\n\t- **Brand-product**: Your product experience is an extension of your brand. How your product looks and works influences your brand perception.\n\t- **Brand-channel:**¬†Your brand could determine how you approach certain channels, and it could even help you rule out channels. If you operate in a very serious industry like cybersecurity, you might want to avoid informal channels like TikTok or Snapchat. If your brand is family-oriented, there are many \"adult\" placements you wouldn't want your brand seen on. And if your brand is all about sustainability, you might rule out resource-intensive channels like direct mail.\n- As you can see, brand touches every aspect of your business. We recommend starting with finding market-brand fit, then allowing your learnings to shape how you approach the other brand fits.\n\n## Market-channel fit\n- **Definition: how your market fits with your customer acquisition channels**\n- Your market will influence which channels you pursue.\n- As we discussed in the market-brand fit section, your market will have expectations ==depending on the industry and product category.==\n- If you're selling payroll software to municipalities with over a million citizens, you have a very small market to sell to: the purchasing department and financiers of select cities. It would make little sense, from a communications standpoint, to try to reach those people using Snapchat ads. Why? Two main reasons:\n\t- **The channel ==isn't targeted== enough**: Snapchat will allow you to target your ads to specific locations, but it won't allow you to target the specific employees of a city. This means that if you run Snapchat ads, most viewers will fall outside your target market.\n\t- **The channel context ==doesn't align==:**¬†It's possible that your target market has Snapchat, but that's definitely not the channel they expect (or want) to see work-related content on. Seeing an ad for payroll software on a non-business app might make them hesitate to trust your brand with something as serious as payroll.\n- Just because a channel exists doesn't mean you need to use it. That's why it's so important to ==truly understand your market.== Deep customer research will uncover key insights such as where potential customers spend time offline and online, how they purchase products like yours, their buying intent on various channels, and other channel-related clues.\n- Having these insights allows you to ==identify optimal channels, cut the rest, and hone your messaging to each specific channel.== We'll show you exactly how to do that in later modules.\n\n## Product-channel fit\n- **Definition: how your product fits with your customer acquisition channels**\n- The product you sell must also align with the channel you sell it through.\n- Let's continue our payroll software example from the last section. Because your market is small, you'll need to charge a lot for your product to generate revenue and grow. In order to charge a lot, your product must be robust. Your sales cycle will be pretty complex, as the buyer is going to need to make sure your product is perfect for them before signing off on a large purchase.\n\t- Because the product is expensive and the sales cycle is complex, you'll need to ==choose an acquisition channel that allows you to communicate product information effectively with your target market.==\n\t- In this example, a channel like Facebook ads wouldn't allow you to convince your buyer to make a large purchase. Users are scrolling too quickly and absorbing too little information for such a complex product. ==Direct sales== would probably make the most sense.\n- As a rule of thumb:¬†**The more complex your product, the more direct and hands-on your acquisition channel needs to be.**\n- The other important thing to consider as you find your product-channel fit is that ==channels are usually out of your direct control.== Google's SEO algorithm changes, and the price of ads fluctuates.\n- What¬†_is_¬†in your control is your product. So it's smart to ==build your product for the specific channel(s) you want to leverage.== Since channels aren't in your control, you must be able to adjust your product over time to work with your chosen growth channels.\n\n## Model-channel fit\n- **Definition: how your business model fits with your customer acquisition channels**\n- Your business model will limit the acquisition channels that are worth testing.\n- Let's say you charge $100,000 up front for your product. That's a lot of money, and it will require extensive communication with a prospective customer to close the deal. Your customer isn't going to feel comfortable paying you $100,000 after seeing a few ads and reading the FAQs page on your site. ==You need a more context-rich channel, like sales.==\n\t- Luckily, with such a high contract value, you'll be able to afford such an expensive channel. Your model-channel fit will be strong.\n- Here're a couple of other rules to consider:\n\t- **The more expensive your product, the more direct and hands-on your acquisition channel needs to be**.¬†You‚Äôll likely need multiple touchpoints to communicate the value of your product and get customers over the high price point.\n\t- **The more friction there is in your product, the more hands-on your channel needs to be**. Low-cost channels like virality can work for free products because there‚Äôs virtually no friction‚Äîthere‚Äôs no cost to use the product. Complex, high-friction products‚Äîlike most B2B tools‚Äîwill require higher-touch, context-rich channels like content and sales.\n- You should also pay attention to the unit economics when considering your model-channel fit. The cost of acquiring a customer will vary drastically based on your channel:\n\t- Product virality has a very low cost.\n\t- Content marketing is typically next in line.\n\t- Paid marketing comes next.\n\t- Then sales.\n- **Note**: Sales can be broken down into two sub-categories:¬†**inbound**¬†sales and¬†**outbound**¬†sales. \n\t- With inbound, you ==pair sales with a second channel lane==‚Äîusually content or paid marketing. The secondary channel produces your lead gen while your inbound sales team turns those leads into customers. \n\t- Outbound sales ==relies on your sales team to produce both lead gen and the conversion of those leads.== On our cost spectrum, inbound sales is generally lower-cost than outbound.\n- To drive growth profitably at scale, you must ==have a business model that produces significantly more revenue than the cost of your channel.==\n\t- For example, an ecommerce store whose average customer spends only $30/year will struggle to afford to acquire customers through ads. It will likely cost more than $30 to acquire each new customer. Similarly, a B2B company with an average customer value of $500 will struggle to make outbound sales work. Since sales labor isn't cheap, it usually costs more than $500 to close a B2B sale.\n\n## The five fits summary\n- There's no such thing as a \"perfect fit.\" It's not fixed, and it's not something you ever \"finish.\" Markets are always changing, products come and go, and channels are constantly in flux.¬†\n- Our job as startup and growth leaders is to design foundations using these fits as our guiding light, and then consistently optimize the fits as we experiment and learn.\n- We put a lot of emphasis on the five fits because they set the stage for what really matters when it comes to growth. Far too many people get caught up in channel strategy, tactics, and A/B testing. None of this matters if your foundation is broken. And yet all those things will be significantly more effective if your foundation is strong.\n- This framework serves as a shortcut for ==figuring out which marketing channels you should pursue.== When you're just starting to think about customer acquisition, there are seemingly endless channels and tactics to consider. But once you start thinking about your strategy through the lens of the five fits, it becomes clear that there are actually very few ways to approach customer acquisition‚Äîand you'll be able to confidently ignore the rest.","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.739605357Z","tags":null},"/Sources/Demand-Curve/Understanding-Your-Competitors":{"title":"Understanding Your Competitors","content":"[[Atlas/Maps/Demand Curve Growth MOC]]\n\n- Most problems can be solved in a variety of ways. Chances are some of your competitors approach the same problem you tackle in a different way or solve it for a different group of people.¬†\n- Because of this, there are two kinds of competitors:\n\t -  **Direct:**¬†Companies that target the same customer base as you and use a similar solution to solve the same problem.\n\t\t -  Example: Uber and Lyft are direct competitors. People can consider either for hailing rides.\n\t- **Indirect:**¬†Companies that sell something similar to your product but target a different audience, or target the same audience with a different product. There are a few different types of indirect competitors, which we‚Äôll get into later.\n- Direct competitors aren‚Äôt the only ones you should research. Indirect competitors, ==specifically those with a similar business model and audience,== are just as important.\n- But direct or indirect, not all companies are dedicated to growth experimentation‚Äîwhich means not every competitor will be worth studying. To filter out these companies, grade them based on their¬†**quality**,¬†**rigor**, and¬†**relevance**.\n\n## Quality\nLow-quality companies won‚Äôt get you very far in terms of growth learnings. For more practical insights, focus your research on high-quality companies. You can judge companies using these three metrics:\n1.  **Revenue:**¬†High revenue often speaks to a company‚Äôs growth success, ==even if they‚Äôre not profitable.== If company revenue data isn‚Äôt publicly available, fundraising makes a good proxy. Look for companies that have received lots of funding from reputable investors.\n2.  **Size:**¬†Quality companies tend to be bigger, since a larger company size may mean that whatever they‚Äôre doing is working well enough to bring on more employees. A good rule of thumb for judging size: ==look for businesses that have expanded beyond their founders.== From our experience, startup teams that have grown to 30-50+ people tend to be more developed and of higher quality.¬†\n3.  **Growth track record:**¬†Companies that have had long-term, sustainable growth, like Amazon and Uber, tend to provide more reliable growth insights than early stage companies. Why? ==There may be hidden factors behind early stage companies‚Äô success or external factors out of their control.==\n\t- Consider how the social audio app Clubhouse took off in its first year, with nearly 10 million downloads in February 2021. Two months later, downloads dipped by 89%. Given its short-lived growth, Clubhouse probably isn‚Äôt so reliable for growth insights.\n\n- The best companies to study hit all three: high revenue/funding, a team with employees beyond the founders, and a consistent history of growth.\n- Important note: Company quality is less important ==when you're trying to define or optimize your value props and brand messaging.== In this case, other early stage companies are better for research, especially those receiving a lot of press or that have raised some money.¬†\n- As new companies, these startups usually haven‚Äôt grown much yet, so they‚Äôre not useful for getting growth learnings‚Äîbut ==there‚Äôs a reason they‚Äôre getting attention.== Study them to find out their value props and get inspiration for how to differentiate your own. (We cover this in more detail in our Value Props unit.)\n\n## Rigor\n- We use ‚Äúrigor‚Äù to describe ==how dedicated a company is to growth experimentation.== Competitors that clearly invest in this are better for your research because they‚Äôre not just taking guesses‚Äîthey‚Äôre using the scientific method to figure out what works.\n- You can find out a company‚Äôs level of rigor through these three indicators:\n\t1. **Public experiment results:**¬†Some companies, like Pinterest and Uber, have blog posts dedicated to experimentation. Do a quick site search of your competitors and phrases like ‚ÄúA/B test‚Äù and ‚Äúexperiments‚Äù to see if any of this is public.\n\t2. **Growth roles:**¬†Check out competitors‚Äô LinkedIn pages to see if there are team members or open positions dedicated to growth, experimentation, or CRO. This includes not only growth marketers, but also engineers and data scientists. Bonus: Some job descriptions also give away a lot of marketing/product strategy, even future plans‚Äîin other words, lots of free insight.\n\t3. **Experimentation software:**¬†Use¬†[BuiltWith](https://builtwith.com/)¬†to find out what paid analytics and experimentation software companies are using on their website. Look at BuiltWith‚Äôs Detailed Technology Profile tab to see whether/how long this software has been active. Companies that are dedicated to experimentation often invest in more software and are running it on an ongoing basis.\n- Not all companies openly share about their growth experiments, so how dedicated one is to experimental rigor isn‚Äôt always obvious. Prioritize studying businesses that show ==at least two of these three indicators.==\n\n## Relevance\n- Remember that competitor research isn‚Äôt only about looking at direct competitors‚Äîyou should also study indirect ones.¬†\n- Some indirect competitors are more relevant to your company than others. Here‚Äôs how to classify them:\n\t1.  **Different solution:**¬†Companies that solve the same problem for the same customer, but in a different way. Example: Workout subscription programs like DailyBurn offer a different solution from gym memberships. They target the same audience but offer an alternative solution to getting in shape.\n\t2.  **Different problem:**¬†Companies that solve a different problem for the same customer using the same solution. Example: Uber Eats sells to the same customers as Uber using the same technology, but it solves a different problem (food delivery).\n\t3.  **Different customer:**¬†Companies that solve the same problem in a similar way, but for a different set of customers. Example: Tinder and Raya are both online dating apps, but while Tinder targets young singles in general, Raya focuses more on celebrities and high-profile people.\n- ==Indirect competitors with a different solution== tend to be the most relevant and worth researching. \n\t- That‚Äôs because even though your solutions are different, having the same problem and customers means these competitors face the same consumer mindset and psychology as you. \n\t- The tactics that work for them are most likely to work for you as well‚Äîstudy them to find out why their solution might appeal more to customers than yours.\n- Competitors with a different problem but the same solution and customer are next best for research because they may be a threat to your company, especially if they leverage their product to enter your space. \n\t- Consider how Uber tapped into its drivers to launch Uber Eats, a competitor to DoorDash and Grubhub.\n- Finally, competitors with different customers are usually the least relevant. If their strategy applies to an entirely different market (one with a different psychology), you shouldn‚Äôt expect it to work for yours.","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.739605357Z","tags":null},"/Sources/Demand-Curve/What-is-Growth":{"title":"What is Growth","content":"[[Atlas/Maps/Demand Curve Growth MOC]]\n\u003e_\"A startup is a company designed to grow fast. ...

If you pull them in the wrong order, the machine isn't going to do what you need it to do. \n\t- But when you get them right, you'll build a growth engine that will consistently get you more customers and increase your revenue.\n- Throughout this program, you're going to learn what each lever does and which ones you should be pulling.\n\t- E.G. Let's say you think your company should be running Facebook ads. Before committing to that channel, you'll need to understand the inputs of that activity (money, time, resources) and the desired outputs (more revenue and customers).\n\t- Once you understand the underlying mechanics of how growth works, you'll realize that there are far fewer ways to grow a company than most people think. The strategies you'll learn in this program will allow you to generate results, regardless of the industry, country, or size of your startup.\n- The type of growth you're going to learn throughout this program is strategic, experimental, and logical.\n- Growth is¬†**not**¬†about:\n\t- Jumping from one tactic to another in search of a spike in traffic or revenue\n\t- Spreading your limited resources thin across multiple strategies and channels\n\t- Frantically rushing to a new strategy or channel because others are getting results\n- Growth is¬†**not**¬†about being reactive.¬†**Growth is about being proactive and putting your effort toward activities that are proven to align with your business model, market, brand, and product.**","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.739605357Z","tags":null},"/Sources/Demand-Curve/What-to-Charge-For":{"title":"What to Charge For","content":"- Depending on your business model, what you charge for might be very clear.\n\t-   If you sell physical goods, you generally charge for each item you sell. Allbirds charges for shoes; Ikea charges for furniture.\n\t-   If you earn revenue through ads (e.g., social media platforms), you probably charge for how many times an ad is clicked or viewed.\n- But for other business model types‚Äîincluding SaaS and marketplaces‚Äîknowing what to charge for can be thornier. Consider a fitness app that offers on-the-go workouts. They could charge for:\n\t-   Weekly/monthly/annual usage\n\t-   Number of workouts started\n\t-   Number of workouts completed\n\t-   Number of minutes spent working out\n\t-   Specific training programs\n\t-   Access to various features and tools, like an activity log or meal plans\n\t-   Personalized fitness needs\n- Any of those are viable options. Which is right?\n\n## Value metrics\n- The answer is the fitness app‚Äôs value metric.¬†**A value metric indicates how much value your buyers get out of your product.**¬†==The more they pay, the more value they get.==\n- Here are some value metrics used by popular companies. These are what they charge for. They might charge per metric or per batches of metrics‚Äîfor instance, Airbnb charges per night booked, whereas Wistia charges one rate for up to 10 videos/podcasts, and another for up to 100.\n| **Company** | **Value Metric**        |\n| ----------- | ----------------------- |\n| Wistia      | Videos/podcast episodes |\n| SendGrid    | Emails/month            |\n| Airbnb      | Nights booked           |\n| HubSpot     | Marketing contracts     |\n| GrubHub     | Orders placed           |\n| ZenDesk     | Automated answers       |\n\n- Your value metric is the¬†**most important thing to get right about pricing**. ==The reason is that when you align your pricing with your product‚Äôs value, users will stick around.== They came to your product because of the value it offers, and they‚Äôll stay if they‚Äôre paying for what they‚Äôre getting out of it.\n- Companies that use value metrics¬†[typically grow at twice the rate](https://www.profitwell.com/recur/all/outcome-based-value-metrics-for-growth)¬†of companies with flat fees or strictly feature-based tiered pricing, with half the churn and twice the expansion revenue.\n- You might find that charging per value metric won‚Äôt work for your company. Value-based pricing requires a lot of data, which new startups don‚Äôt have. We recommend finding your value metric anyway. If nothing else, knowing your value metric will reaffirm your product‚Äôs core value and job-to-be-done.\n\n## Project: Find your value metric\n- As we mentioned earlier, you‚Äôll be putting together a survey or interview template in this module‚Äôs project. Once you‚Äôve collected data from your survey/interviews, you‚Äôll add it to the personas you created in the Market and Customer Research module.  \n  - Use¬†[this template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13AlCCRWrZkY7P4LbZp1XnRaUQjSENLOFsRNqV3vGZRg/edit?usp=sharing)¬†to track your project for this module. We‚Äôve gone ahead and populated it with fake info from an imaginary language-learning app. Make a copy, delete the dummy text, and add your own as you go through these project steps.\n### Step 1: Write down your job-to-be-done\n- Back in the Market and Customer Research module, you considered your startup‚Äôs job-to-be-done (JTBD) (See [[Sources/Demand Curve/JBTD Framework|JBTD Framework]]). What job are users ‚Äúhiring‚Äù your product to do? Revisit the answer to that question, and add it to your project doc.  \n  - Examples of JTBDs, using the companies in the table above:\n\t-   Wistia: grow your business through videos/podcasts\n\t-   SendGrid: grow your business‚Äôs email marketing\n\t-   Airbnb: connect travelers with rental hosts\n\t-   HubSpot: build and improve customer relationships\n\t-   Grubhub: connect restaurants with people who want to order in\n\t-   Zendesk: streamline customer service\n- You can see how their JTBDs relate to their value metrics.\n### Step 2: Convert your JTBD into a metric or proxies\n- Sometimes your value metric will be clear based on your JTBD. If your JTBD is ‚Äúdeliver coffee every month,‚Äù your value metric is ‚Äúcoffee bags.‚Äù\n- But most startups will need to find stand-ins for their value metric.\n- Most of the value metrics in the above table are actually stand-ins for true value metrics. \n\t- Wistia‚Äôs JTBD, for example, is business growth through videos and podcasting. \n\t- Their ultimate value metric is something pertaining to growth, like the number of new signups a business gets from using Wistia for marketing. \n\t- But that would be incredibly difficult to charge for, so instead, they charge for videos and podcasts. Presumably, more videos/podcasts mean more growth.\n- Come up with a list of up to 10 proxies. We‚Äôve included examples in the project doc for our fake language-learning app. Add your own to your copy of the doc.\n- Then answer these questions for each proxy.\n\n| **Question**                                      | **Why it's important to ask**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Does it align with our customers‚Äô needs?          | Customers should be paying for the value they‚Äôre experiencing.

It should help with customer acquisition, not hinder it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| Does it make sense as a way to retain customers?  | Your metric should help reduce churn, not grow it‚Äîwhich is why it‚Äôs so important to make it scalable. If users feel like they‚Äôre getting fair value from your product for how much they‚Äôre using and paying for it, they‚Äôll stick with it.                                                                                                                                     |\n\n- If the answer to any of the above questions is \"no,\" cut that proxy.\n- The proxies that are still contenders will make it onto your customer survey/interview template. We‚Äôll go over how to add them later in this module, when we discuss prepping and shipping your survey.\n","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.739605357Z","tags":null},"/Sources/Demand-Curve/Why-Brand-Matters-for-Growth":{"title":"Why Brand Matters for Growth","content":"- Many founders think that their product can sell itself. Or they believe that simply implementing proven marketing tactics can lead to growth.\n- But without a strong brand, it's difficult for startups to grow past a certain stage. Even if they're tapping the right channels, they can only go so far before hitting a wall. There are three major reasons why:\n\t- **Branding differentiates your company.**¬†==Psychologically, branding gives people a mental shortcut by separating your company from others.== Consider how people recognize sign and billboard logos on the roadside as different restaurants and businesses even without seeing their names spelled out. Done well, branding makes products memorable; it triggers users‚Äô recall.\n\t- **Branding amplifies customer relationships.**¬†We have a natural preference for stories because they help us process information; they engage us and¬†[motivate us to act](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/04/11/815573198/how-stories-connect-and-persuade-us-unleashing-the-brain-power-of-narrative). ==Strong branding essentially tells the story of how a product or company can help us not just solve a problem but triumph over adversity.== Seeing ourselves in these stories makes companies feel more relatable‚Äîand since they resonate with us, we‚Äôre more likely to become loyal customers. We continue buying from the same company even if a competitor offers a cheaper alternative.\n\t- **Branding gives you a growth edge.**¬†Many modern companies take a rigid, data-driven approach to growth. This method once gave companies an edge over their less sophisticated competitors but now, this approach is the standard. So it‚Äôs not enough for companies to be data-driven‚Äî==they must also take a human-centered approach that convinces prospects not just with reason but with emotion.== In a world where millions of companies constantly compete for consumers‚Äô attention, only the ones that emotionally resonate stand a chance at creating long-term recall.\n- Here‚Äôs a real-life example of how brand work can lead to more customers.\n\t- A SaaS company,¬†[Stacker](https://www.stackerhq.com/), hired our agency Bell Curve to refresh its product messaging and design. This included creating new copy and visuals for its site, emails, and ad campaigns, changes that ultimately led to an overall increase in conversions:\n\t\t- Homepage conversions: +100%\n\t\t- Landing page conversions: 2.5x lift\n\t\t- Ad clickthrough rate: +22%\n\t- There weren‚Äôt any major changes in Stacker‚Äôs product, but rather, how it presented itself. Stacker has a strong product, so the branding work Bell Curve did was like adding gas to a fire.\n- But in many cases, ==a strong brand makes it possible for an inferior product to win over more customers than a superior product‚Äîand to even charge¬†more.== Remember the taste test of McDonald‚Äôs and Starbucks coffee‚Äîpeople pay more for Starbucks‚Äô coffee despite the fact McDonald‚Äôs coffee tastes better and costs less.\n- In short, brand amplifies the other pieces of your company‚Äôs [[Five Fits Framework]]: \n\t- It increases the perceived value of your product and your market‚Äôs willingness to pay. \n\t- It enhances the product experience. \n\t- And it boosts the effectiveness of your funnel and growth channels. \n\t- This all leads to higher conversion rates, retention, and customer lifetime value.\n\n## When does my company need to focus on branding?\n- Building a brand isn‚Äôt just for mature companies. Conversely, brand building is exactly what helped established names like Nike to find success in the first place. Every business benefits, especially early-stage companies that are:\n\t- **Entering a saturated market.**¬†Consider the thousands of retailers selling apparel around the world. Though many sell yoga pants, many women are drawn specifically to Lululemon‚Äôs because of its stylish, community-focused branding. No matter its price or quality, brand helps to differentiate your product in a crowded market.\n\t- **Competing against a very established name.**¬†Customers often conflate recognition with credibility. In other words, when given the option, it‚Äôs easier to trust a familiar brand over an unfamiliar one even if the no-name brand has a better product. But branding gives underdogs a chance to defeat Goliath. Think of how the investing app Robinhood built an identity around democratizing finance (down to its name!) to challenge long-standing brokerages.\n- However, you may be wondering at what point early-stage companies should¬†prioritize¬†building their brand. We advise doing different levels of brand work at three key points:\n\t- ![[Extras/Media/Images/Stages of Branding.png]]\n\t- **Product development:**¬†Since branding creates product experience, you should develop a high-level framework of your brand early on. This is a rough idea of who your company is and what it stands for. Use it to guide your product development, like which features to prioritize that align with both your brand and target audience.¬†\n\t- **Product validation:**¬†Brand work is minimal at this phase. Instead, use your initial brand concept to guide product tests and collect feedback from users. You may realize that your early brand idea doesn‚Äôt resonate with your target audience, or it attracts unexpected segments. If you‚Äôre seeing poor results, move back to the product development phase and modify your original concept.¬†\n\t- **Early traction:**¬†Once you‚Äôve experienced some traction (once you‚Äôre acquiring customers) revisit brand in more detail. Invest in more robust branding work to refine your messaging and design.\n- Again, brand building is a ==long-term process==‚Äîso don‚Äôt try to nail down all brand details early on. \n\t- The point is to develop a rough brand identity in tandem with your product. \n\t- Then focus on testing your product and getting user feedback. \n\t- Once you‚Äôve developed consistent traction, brand work should be included as a piece of your growth strategy.\n- Why does branding deserve more attention later on?¬†**It powers every aspect of growth, with effects that trickle down to your conversions, click-through rates, and so on.**¬†Because of brand, customers value your product as more than a commodity. They trust your company and become repeat buyers and brand ambassadors, eager to share their experience with more people.","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.739605357Z","tags":null},"/Sources/Demand-Curve/Why-Growth-Matters":{"title":"Why Growth Matters","content":"[[Atlas/Maps/Demand Curve Growth MOC]]\n- There's a commonly held belief among founders that the number one cause of startup failure is a poor product.  But there's another reason that doesn't get as much attention. Peter Thiel says it well: _‚ÄúMost businesses actually get zero distribution channels to work. ==Poor distribution== ‚Äî not product ‚Äî is the number one cause of failure.‚Äù_\n- Failory, a company that studies why businesses failed, reports the following:\n\t- ![[Extras/Media/Images/Common Reasons for Startup Failure.png]]\n\t- Their study concluded: \"**Marketing**¬†**mistakes**¬†were by far the most common [type], and they were generally speaking the most deadly with 69% of all mentioned marketing mistakes being fatal.\"\n\t- Marketing is often at the root of startup failures.\n- Our method puts¬†**the market**¬†**first**. You aren't trying to¬†_find_¬†a market for your product; ==you're trying to¬†_build_¬†a product for a specific market.==\n- But there's another important framing that makes it even more apparent how critical marketing is to getting traction. When we read the studies above, it's easy to assume that the startup¬†_did_¬†in fact get their product in the hands of the¬†_right_¬†market.¬†\n\t- But what if the startup doesn't have a clear understanding of their market in the first place? \n\t- Or what if they know their market, but they're struggling to leverage marketing channels to reach the right customers?\n- **This program focuses on helping startups acquire customers and think more strategically about growth. You'll write landing pages, design ads, launch channels, etc. But more importantly, we'll help you approach your market in a holistic, validated way.**","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.739605357Z","tags":null},"/Sources/Deschooling-Society-Book":{"title":"Deschooling Society - Book","content":"## Information\n- **Source:** [[Ivan Illich]]\n- **Tags:** #education \n- **Notes:** \n\n## Highlights\n+ Two illusions of the school system\n\t+ Packaging instruction with certification; linking instruction (not learning) to role assignment\n\t+ Most learning is the result of teaching","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.739605357Z","tags":null},"/Sources/Design-Justice-Book":{"title":"Design Justice - Book","content":"## Information \n- **Source:** [[Sasha Costanza-Chock]]\n- **Tags:** #design #technology #innovation  #nonfiction #society #education \n- **Notes:** [[Miscellaneous Notes/Literature Notes/Design Justice - Literature Notes]]\n\n\n## Reboot Summary\n- Design justice also focuses on the ==design of systems==\n- Design justice rethinks design processes, centers people who are normally marginalized by design, and uses collaborative, creative practices to address the deepest challenges our communities face.\n\n**Design Education**\n- Rather than teaching rules, design education should prompt students to ==investigate== where problems stem from and how to ==solve== them inclusively\n- radical educator Paulo Freire\n- Freire writes, ‚Äúthe goal of education is to transform oppressed individuals into subjects who engage in collective action to transform their conditions of oppression.‚Äù\n- ==education lives within a system of domination and liberation==; each participant should think, question, and act to identify the causes of the problems within that system.\n- Designers should keep the following principles in mind: change emerges over time from a collaborative process, rather than appearing out of thin air at the end; we should facilitate change without presuming to be the expert; everyone in the design process should share their perspectives; and most importantly, we should finding out what‚Äôs already working and uplift those systems.\n\n**On Learning and Building**\n- quote about constructionism: ‚ÄúLearning is a reconstruction, rather than a transmission of knowledge.‚Äù\n- although it is beautiful to think about how nothing is truly done, learnt or built alone, we must always consider who and what we are (re)constructing with. \n- If learning is a reconstruction of knowledge, then everything we learn reflects the learnings of the people we‚Äôre told to listen to unless we choose to do otherwise.\n- By seeking out diverse voices and learning together, we can build shared consciousness and better understand the world and the predicaments that plague us.\n\n## Book Highlights\n### Chapter 5\n\u003e ‚ÄúCritical pedagogy seeks to transform consciousness, to provide students with ways of knowing that enable them to know themselves better and live in the world more fully.\n‚Äîbell hooks, Teaching to Transgress‚Äù\n\n\u003e ‚ÄúI insist that the object of all true education is not to make people carpenters, it is to make carpenters people.\n‚ÄîW.

Du Bois, The Talented Tenth‚Äù\n\n\u003e approaches communities not as (solely) consumers, test subjects, ‚Äútest beds,‚Äù or objects of study, but instead imagines them as co-designers and coauthors of shared knowledge, technologies, narratives, and social practices\n\n\u003e ‚Äúpedagogies of design justice must be based firmly upon the broader approach known as popular education (educaci√≥n popular, in Spanish), or pop ed, as it is often called by practitioners in the United States.‚Äù\n\n\u003e ‚Äúbanking model of education, in which an educator, positioned as the expert, attempts to deposit knowledge in the mind of their students.‚Äù\n\n\u003e ‚Äúhe encourages critical pedagogy, where the role of the educator is to pose problems, create spaces for the collective development of critical consciousness, help to develop plans for action to make the world a better place, and develop a sense of agency among learners.‚Äù\n\n\u003e ‚ÄúFreire focuses on developing critical thought together with action, in a cycle he refers to as praxis, a Greek term originally referring to ‚Äúpractical knowledge for action.‚Äù7 Freire defines it as ‚Äúreflection and action upon the world in order to transform it.‚Äù\n\n\u003e ‚Äúthe goal of education is to transform oppressed individuals into subjects who engage in collective action to transform their conditions of oppression.‚Äù\n\nKey Principles of Pop Ed:\n1. Education is never neutral\n2. Relevance\n3. Problem-posing\n4. Dialogue\n5. Praxis\n6. Transformation\n\n\u003e ‚ÄúInstead of being used as a tool to divide and conquer, we believe technology must be taken back by the people and used as a tool of liberation.‚Äù\n\n\u003e ‚Äúcritical community technology pedagogy, an approach that ‚Äúdemystifies systemic power inequalities, involves a multi-directional learning process, results in transferable skills, and constructs a new world as it constructs knowledge.‚Äù\n\n\u003e ‚Äúconstructionism. Although not explicit about race, class, gender, or disability politics, this is a pedagogical approach that centers context, situated knowledge, and learning by doing.‚Äù\n\n\u003e ‚Äúfor Piaget, learning is experiential: it takes place through an active process where the learner develops the ability to modify or transform an object or idea.‚Äù\n\n\u003e ‚Äúconstructionism‚Äôs two central concepts: first, that learning is a reconstruction, rather than a transmission, of knowledge; second, that ‚Äúlearning is most effective when part of an activity the learner experiences as constructing a meaningful product.‚Äù\n\n\u003e ‚Äúteachers act as facilitators to help students achieve their own learning goals using problem-based learning.‚Äù\n\n\u003e ‚ÄúProblem-based learning works best when problems are part of larger, ideally real-world tasks; learners are supported to take ownership of the problem; the task is appropriate to the learner‚Äôs level of understanding and ability; the learner must reflect on what is being learned and how they learned it; and the educator encourages the learner to test their ideas in various contexts.‚Äù\n\n\u003e ‚ÄúWe need to expand the notion of ‚Äòdigital fluency‚Äô to include designing and creating, not just browsing and interacting.‚Äù\n\n\u003e ‚Äútechnological fluency, or young people‚Äôs ability to fully incorporate computers and digital technology into their own creative practices.‚Äù\n\n\u003e ‚ÄúFrom this experience, Resnick describes four principles for technology educators: support learning through design experiences, help youth build upon their own interests, cultivate ‚Äúemergent community,‚Äù and create an environment of respect and trust.‚Äù\n\n\u003e ‚ÄúResnick summarizes the core of constructionism in the following two principles: first, ‚Äúpeople do not get ideas, they make them.‚Äù Second, ‚Äúpeople construct new knowledge with particular effectiveness when they are engaged in constructing personally meaningful products.‚Äù\n\n\u003e ‚ÄúDecolonizing design involves decentering Western approaches to design pedagogy, while centering design approaches, histories, theories, and practices rooted in indigenous communities.‚Äù\n\n\u003e ‚Äúdesign is no less than the conception and planning of the artificial world. Its products include objects, processes, systems, and environments; in short, everything.‚Äù\n\n\u003e ‚ÄúEducators, hooks argues, must recognize ourselves as embodied subjects in the classroom, rather than pretend that we speak from a disembodied place.‚Äù\n\nDesign Justice Network Principles\n1. ‚ÄúWe Use Design to Sustain, Heal, and Empower Our Communities, as Well as to Seek Liberation from Exploitative and Oppressive Systems‚Äù\n2. ‚ÄúWe Center the Voices of Those Who Are Directly Impacted by the Outcomes of the Design Process‚Äù\n3. ‚ÄúWe Prioritize Design‚Äôs Impact on the Community Over the Intentions of the Designer‚Äù\n4. ‚ÄúWe View Change as Emergent from an Accountable, Accessible, and Collaborative Process, Rather than as a Point at the End of a Process‚Äù\n5. ‚ÄúWe See the Role of the Designer as a Facilitator Rather than an Expert‚Äù\n6. ‚ÄúWe Believe that Everyone Is an Expert Based on Their Own Lived Experience and that We All Have Unique and Brilliant Contributions to Bring to a Design Process‚Äù\n7. ‚ÄúWe Share Design Knowledge and Tools with Our Communities‚Äù\n8. ‚ÄúWe Work toward Sustainable, Community-Led, and Controlled Outcomes‚Äù\n9. ‚ÄúWe Work toward Nonexploitative Solutions that Reconnect Us to the Earth and to Each Other‚Äù\n10. ‚ÄúBefore Seeking New Design Solutions, We Look for What Is Already Working at the Community Level, and We Honor and Uplift Traditional, Indigenous, and Local Knowledge and Practices‚Äù\n\n\u003e ‚ÄúLearning to Code as Liberatory World-Making, or ==Workplace Preparedness under Neoliberal Technoculture==?‚Äù\n\n\u003e ‚ÄúTeaching people how to code is increasingly presented as a key goal‚Äîperhaps the key goal‚Äîfor the education system under ==late-stage informational capitalism==.‚Äù\n\n\u003e ‚ÄúAt the same time, as sociologist Tressie McMillan Cottom documents in her book Lower Ed: The Troubling Rise of For-Profit Colleges in the New Economy, for-profit universities that promise to teach coding skills and secure jobs for their graduates proliferate both on and offline.93 Many of the most visible for-profit coding schools and boot camps are ==expensive, inaccessible, and have dubious placement outcomes.==94‚Äù\n\n\u003e ‚Äúdigital learning among young people remains ==structured== by race, class, and gender.‚Äù\n\n\u003e ‚ÄúIn a recent study of digital learning, education researchers Mimi Ito and Justin Reich find that, in many cases, digital learning technologies such as MOOCs and online courses, in-school computing classes, and other interventions ==actually exacerbate inequalities in learning outcomes== between low-income and wealthier students, between students of color and white students, and between male and female students. In addition, they note that the use of digital technology in education often ==unintentionally reproduces inequality==, in large part due to ‚Äúinstitutionalized and unconscious bias and social distance between developers and those they seek to serve.‚Äù\n\n\u003e ‚Äúlearning to code is increasingly taught in ways that emphasize diversity, creativity, and critical thinking.‚Äù\n\n\u003e ‚ÄúIs the ultimate object to make people good coders, or to make coders good people?‚Äù\n\n\u003e ‚Äúdesign pedagogies that promote critical thinking are not incompatible with the development of practical design skills.‚Äù\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.739605357Z","tags":null},"/Sources/Do-Design-Book":{"title":"Do Design - Book","content":"## Information\n- **Source:** [[Alan Moore]]\n- **Tags:** #nonfiction #design #philosophy\n- **Notes:** [[Miscellaneous Notes/Literature Notes/Do Design - Literature Notes]]\n\n## Highlights\n- salve corpus amanti, literally translated as ‚Äòsave the lover‚Äôs body‚Äô.\n    - 2. What did astronaut Edgar Mitchell have to say about beauty?\n- Is the world a work of art?\n    - 3. The most beautiful question in the world\n- the question of beauty takes us away from the surfaces to thinking about the core foundations of things.\n    - 4. The roots of design\n- all useful things should also be beautiful. God, as architect Mies van der Rohe said, was in the details and, you never know, an angel may come one day and sit on that chair ‚Äì it had to be worthy of such an event.\n    - 5. The enduring utility, honesty and beauty in Shaker design\n- if you cannot describe a new destination, you will never get there.\n    - 6. What world was Doug Engelbart trying to create?\n- the limits of our language are the limits of our world. A new language enables us to make the transition from where we are now, to where we need to get to. It lets us leap disciplinary boundaries. If we can‚Äôt describe it, then we struggle to make it.\n    - 6. What world was Doug Engelbart trying to create?\n- January 30, 2020\n- 7. The troubled man and the mountain\n- But without a guiding philosophy, we end up stripping away our navigational compass and losing sight first of our humanity, then our potential.\n- January 30, 2020\n- 8. The great stillness\n- To bring great stillness into one‚Äôs work means one can truly commit to its execution and most beautiful realisation. It is commitment, Tashi says, that gives you freedom.\n- January 30, 2020\n- 9. A quest for truth is always core to the purpose of a poet\n- important characteristics of craftsmanship: a granite-like integrity and a deep empathy for the world around him.\n- January 30, 2020\n- 9. A quest for truth is always core to the purpose of a poet\n- importance of language: its ability to uplift us, or to shape the way we see and therefore act in the world.\n- January 30, 2020\n- 10. Reality is full of depth of field\n- by removing the distance between subject and observer, empathy gifts us a huge depth of field. It allows us to create works of great truth and great beauty.\n- January 30, 2020\n- 13. The Bill Bailey principle for making the new\n- ‚ÄòThe greatest enemy of creative success is the attempt to fortify against failure.‚Äô\n- January 30, 2020\n- 15. Start with the space between the lines\n- labour at your work until people cannot imagine what you have designed existing any other way. Beauty is work well resolved. It is simple.\n- January 30, 2020\n- 16. The world is sensual and textured\n- Why does art endure? Because it always one way or another speaks directly to our senses.\n- January 30, 2020\n- 16. The world is sensual and textured\n- The interface with design is humanity. Success is when we make a universal cultural contribution ‚Äì scale that as you like.\n- January 30, 2020\n- 17. The master of materials\n- Design is based upon resolving how someone is going to use something. Great design is describing the very best experience for them, then moving towards that ideal.\n- January 30, 2020\n- Fourteen Practices to Create Enduring Beauty\n- ‚ÄòFeel‚Äô is an important filtering system towards truth.\n- January 31, 2020\n- Fourteen Practices to Create Enduring Beauty\n- a ‚Äòpattern language‚Äô of how that company broadly works. This can reveal our own blind spots and gaps in knowledge, suggesting new design possibilities. Everything is made up of component parts.\n- January 31, 2020\n- Fourteen Practices to Create Enduring Beauty\n- Openness is a design tool offering new organisational, social and commercial capability. Openness is cultural ‚Äì being open to new ideas. Openness is mutual ‚Äì the sharing and redistribution of knowledge, information, data resources and wealth.\n- January 31, 2020\n- 20. Time is earthed\n- Some things can take the time they need. Not the time you think they need. Time, like the hedge, is earthed.\n- January 31, 2020\n- 21. Love the work you do: Blitz Motorcycles\n- Investing in loving what you do always costs time, money, and sometimes the odd scar and bruise. It repays that love with personal satisfaction, and in turn it inspires, guides and nurtures the spirit in others.\n- January 31, 2020\n- 22. The beauty in leadership\n- Allowing people to arrive at their own conclusions of what needs to be done, and embracing what they create, is another form of wise leadership.\n- January 31, 2020\n- 22. The beauty in leadership\n- listening openly, making time, helping, being honest, and creating moments of opportunity where the individual and collective hand, heart and mind can begin to build the new.\n- January 31, 2020\n- 23. People embrace what they create\n- ensure people are the true co-creators of their future, that they are heard and listened to.\n- January 31, 2020\n- 23. People embrace what they create\n- If you want to build a ship, don‚Äôt give out orders and tell people exactly what to do. Teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea.\n- January 31, 2020\n- 27. Living off the coast of Utopia\n- Navigating towards ways in which we can design with optimism to uplift our humanity and our planet.\n- January 31, 2020\n- Appendix I:\n- Branby calls his worldview and philosophy ‚ÄòThe Total‚Äô, as it encompasses ethics, business, production process, products and the world we inhabit. For him, ‚ÄòWhat we take, what we make and what we waste‚Äô are in fact all questions of ethics. We have, he says, an unlimited responsibility for ‚ÄòThe Total‚Äô, a responsibility that we try but do not always succeed in taking. One part of that responsibility is the quality of the product and how many years it will endure. Rather than designing in obsolescence, Branby designs it out.\n- January 31, 2020\n- Appendix I:\n- Meaning is created through a craft approach to life. And in many ways it is a gift that we give to ourselves and to others. So craftsmanship does not only exist in the manufacture of ancient tools; it exists, or should exist, in all that we do.\n","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.739605357Z","tags":null},"/Sources/Eliciting-Tech-Futures-Among-Black-Young-Adults":{"title":"Eliciting Tech Futures Among Black Young Adults","content":"## Information\n- **Source:** https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3411764.3445723\n- **Tags:** #future #codesign \n- **Notes:** \n## Annotations\n\n\u003e%%\n\u003e```annotation-json\n\u003e{\"created\":\"2023-08-11T15:22:06.041Z\",\"updated\":\"2023-08-11T15:22:06.041Z\",\"document\":{\"title\":\"Eliciting Tech Futures Among Black Young Adults: A Case Study of Remote Speculative Co-DesignEliciting Tech Futures Among Black Young Adults: A Case Study of Remote Speculative Co-Design\",\"link\":[{\"href\":\"urn:x-pdf:feb3a75e3e7bedd28ad2ce2fddc026c1\"},{\"href\":\"https://www.tawannadillahunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/elicitingtechfutures.pdf\"}],\"documentFingerprint\":\"feb3a75e3e7bedd28ad2ce2fddc026c1\"},\"uri\":\"https://www.tawannadillahunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/elicitingtechfutures.pdf\",\"target\":[{\"source\":\"https://www.tawannadillahunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/elicitingtechfutures.pdf\",\"selector\":[{\"type\":\"TextPositionSelector\",\"start\":26278,\"end\":26495},{\"type\":\"TextQuoteSelector\",\"exact\":\"We wanted to use speculative methods to elicit thoughts and ideas on the future of technology and design.

We want to live in a world in which nothing is lost.\n- It was one of the most surreal things I have experienced. In a time in which I should have felt abandoned by God, I was not reduced to ashes. I felt like I was floating, floating on the love and prayers of all those who hummed around me like worker bees, bringing me notes and socks and flowers and quilts embroidered with words of encouragement.\n- But when they sat beside me, my hand in their hands, my own suffering began to feel like it had revealed to me the suffering of others. I was entering a world of people just like me, people stumbling around in the ==debris of dreams== they thought they were entitled to and plans they didn‚Äôt realize they had made.\n- ‚ÄúWhen the feelings recede like the tides, they will leave an imprint.‚Äù\n- And they do.

Currently, arguments around whether we will forever move away from urban centers, or we will only be working remotely, or we will hang out with friends only in VR, or we will be digitally exhausted demonstrate these qualities, where a few variables render a few versions of the reality. The natural reaction to these narratives is to follow one of these faithfully and to dispel the existence of others. ==The future might actually have both realities interweaving harmoniously without feeling like a transgression.==\n- Metamodernism\n- When we think about venture building, what we are really considering is the possibilities of these  ‚Äúifs‚Äù and their connections to one another.\n\n### Vol. 48: Good work done in defiance\n- ==Bacon-cooler stories:==  If you‚Äôre eating breakfast while reading the paper and a story is so surprising that the bacon on your fork remains uneaten and cools down, you know it‚Äôs compelling.\n- Four guiding principles for being a ==journalist== by Bob Woodward: \n\t- Move outside your comfort zone\n\t- Leave opinion out of stories\n\t- Avoid taking sides\n\t- All good work is done in defiance of management\n\n### Vol. 47: We are, after all, children\n- ÂøçËÄÖÔºåÂøÉÊÄÄÂ§©‰∏ã, the ==resilient has a heart== that contains all under the heaven\n\t- Chinese saying when I‚Äôm faced with difficult decisions in life\n\n### Vol. 46: This is us, forgetting\n- According to Ibn Khaldun, ==history seems to move in four acts==, corresponding to four generations.\n\t1. ==First generation:== revolutionaries who want to make a radical break with the past, establishing new values but also creating chaos in the struggle to do so.\n\t2. ==Second generation: craves some order.== They are still feeling the heat of the revolution itself, having lived through it at a very early age, but they want to stabilize the world, establish some conventions and dogma.\n\t3.  ==Third generation:== feels less passionate about protecting the values of the founders of the revolution. They are pragmatists. They want to solve problems and make life as comfortable as possible. Material concerns predominate, and people can become quite individualistic.\n\t4.  ==Fourth generation:== feels that society has lost its vitality and begins to question the values they have inherited, some becoming quite cynical. A crisis of sorts emerges.\n- These narratives, despite being criticized as oversimplistic and borderline manipulative, are like ==prisms== through which we can gain the necessary ==understanding to act urgently in response to the environment.==\n- Product-zeitgeist fit: when a product ==resonates== with the mood of the times. These can be determined with the following tests:\n\t- ==\"Nerd Heat\":== When the most talented, hardest working, and most in-demand people‚Äîthe product managers, engineers, and data scientists‚Äîare so intrigued by a product that they're working on it, excited by it, and trying to make it a thing.\n\t- ==The \"Despite Test\":== When people are using a product despite the fact that it's not the best thing out there.\n\t- ==The \"T-shirt Test\":== If people with no connection to the company are wearing their t-shirts or putting their stickers on their laptops or wearing their socks, that desire to associate with the idea indicates as much a movement as a product.\n\t- ==The \"Eyebrow Test\":== In the early days, things that have product zeitgeist fit often feel misunderstood or controversial. At first blush, the conceit may even raise a few eyebrows.  \n- As a student, there used to only be three possible courses of action when you don't know the answer to a question: \n\t1. Admit you don't know the answer.\n\t2. Pretend you know the answer even if you know you don't.\n\t3. Imitate someone who seems to know the answer even if you can't be sure they do.\n- But Vaughn Tan argues that with technology, now there is a fourth viable option: ==external memory systems== (e.g. search engines). These make ==learning into ritual and that technology now disguises ritual as actual learning.== In other words, I can easily \"appear smart\" on a subject by a series of Google searches and Wiki page hopping without really understanding neither the answer nor the question.\n- ==Extrapolation:== to compartmentalize your thoughts and actions you need to close them before you move on to another task. It's simple to implement. I ask myself a few questions to extrapolate what I need to take away before I move on to the next task:\n\t- What did I learn?\n\t- Why is that useful for me?\n\t- How / when will I use this?\n\n### Vol. 44: The pixel making of an American Dream\n- *\"Software is not only eating the world but cannibalistically eating itself\"* - Can Duruk\n- To ponder about ==automation==: Have we enabled creativity by reducing barriers of creation or accelerated its demise by abstracting away the lessons that we get to learn from facing the messy complexity of reality?\n- The way language is being spoken, permeated, and interpreted has been changed with new media of transmission. Words are no longer a writer‚Äôs artistic expression but are ==designed to fulfill a certain purpose.==\n- ==Four impulses that propel creators to create== (from George Orwell's \"Why I Write\"): sheer egoism, aesthetic enthusiasm, historical impulse, political purpose.\n\n### Vol. 43: Do not fall asleep on the  road\n- ==Wabi:== Japanese aesthetic that celebrates austerity, spontaneity, and apparent artlessness\n- The limits of her language became the limits of her world.\n- What if literature, the story, the dialogues in the film, the copies on our screen, at its best, can serve as a ==fire escape==? A space of ==raw intimacy== where we can tell each other honestly how we feel.\n\n### Vol. 42: As we become the perfect storm\n- Jared Diamond makes a juxtaposition between personal and national crises. Inspired by the work of psychotherapists, he listed the ==12 factors that determine the outcomes of personal crises.==\n![crisisfactors](https://storage.googleapis.com/reading-supply-assets/reading.supply.0a22e1fd-d8d8-4268-bd06-87c96ed14951.png)\n![quote](https://storage.googleapis.com/reading-supply-assets/reading.supply.e0f0a461-57cc-40ff-9668-a2cc8dfc6b53.png)\n\n### Vol. 41: Meaning finding on the internet\n- In the original Greek, ==apocalypse== doesn‚Äôt mean the catastrophe; it means the ==uncovering==.\n- My proficiency with shortcuts, productivity tools, and swiss grids is attained at a ==cost of suppressing and backlogging our messy, unprocessed emotions.== The feelings, which remain unclaimed and uninterrupted, manifest themselves as directionless anxiety. We feel a compulsive need to remain busy, clinging to a jam-packed schedule that ensures we don‚Äôt have to confront the scary thoughts. (same)\n- Without a deep understanding of ==ourselves==, we also become inept at understanding ==others==, especially those who share the same world but a different reality. And without a deep understanding of others, it‚Äôs almost ==impossible to build==, even when tools are getting friendlier, and more accessible than ever.\n- Consumer culture has anesthetized the need for ==deep emotional connection and spiritual maturity.== Example from Tara Isabella Burton: \"Purveyors of wellness have long said that the body is a temple. But at SoulCycle, at least, the body is worshipper, temple and deity alike.\"\n- Art has a direct purpose as a ==tool of education.== The point of art is to create the kind of beauty that makes us feel less alone, to render tough lessons easier to absorb, to amplify perspectives we tend to overlook, to nudge us towards seeing reality as a canvas of possibility.\n- Like artists, the best founders I know possess the ==sensitivity to people‚Äôs pleasures and pains== that others might overlook, or not take seriously enough to spend time thinking about. What distinguishes an artist is that they use their sensitivity to ==create an alternative version of reality through music, films, or imagery.== For founders, instead of just showing others how nice this could be, the business ==directly enables other people to have the same satisfaction themselves.

The wall has a name: It is ==The System.== The System is supposed to protect us, but sometimes it takes on a life of its own, and then it begins to kill us and cause us to kill others - coldly, efficiently, systematically. I have only one reason to write novels, and that is to ==bring the dignity of the individual soul to the surface and shine a light upon it.== The purpose of a story is to sound an alarm, to keep a light trained on The System in order to prevent it from tangling our souls in its web and demeaning them. I fully believe it is the novelist's job to keep trying to clarify the uniqueness of each individual soul by writing stories - stories of life and death, stories of love, stories that make people cry and quake with fear and shake with laughter.

Everyone wants to live a life bigger than oneself, and one can do that the best when their natural strengths align with what the world needs the most. ==The best talent needs a new way to be discovered, validated, and utilized in a way that's not simply centered around brand signals and numeric metrics used by corporate employment.==\n- How to get ideas out aside from fitness: ==productive daydreaming/actionable visualization==\n\n### Vol. 19: this is between you and me\n- Why are emotions and sentiments exclusive to poetry and the arts, and why are impact and scale exclusive to technology and commerce?

Don't think of it as your accomplishment.Think of it as your gift. Don't think of it as something that God demands from you. Think of it as an enormous present that is given to you. ==The whole of the universe is your gift. ==And if at some point in the universe, it's shaking a little bit, ==that doesn't take away its grandeur, its beauty, its wonder, and its capacity for love.\n==\n","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.739605357Z","tags":null},"/Sources/Fortnite-and-Minecraft-are-getting-kids-excited-about-learning-again-Essay":{"title":"Fortnite and Minecraft are getting kids excited about learning again - Essay","content":"## Information\n- **Source:** [[Greg Toppo]]; [‚ÄòFortnite‚Äô and ‚ÄòMinecraft‚Äô are getting kids excited about learning again](https://www.fastcompany.com/90666530/fortnite-minecraft-education \"‚ÄòFortnite‚Äô and ‚ÄòMinecraft‚Äô are getting kids excited about learning again\")\n- **Tags:** #games #education \n- **Notes:** \n\n## Highlights\n\u003e ‚Äú==I like to say we‚Äôre giving kids the tools that they need to lead successful lives in the digital age‚Äîand preparing them for the coming of the metaverse==,‚Äù said Ed Fleming, founder of a long-running [computer camp](https://www.flemingcamps.com/) based in Philadelphia.

The problem is that it‚Äôs ==not sustainable==. While pointsification may help tweak some behaviors in the short term, it doesn‚Äôt work for long enough to build actual skills.\n\n### True Gamification\nAccording to Jane McGonigal, PhD game designer, a true game has 4 defining traits:\n1.  A **goal** or specific outcome that provides players with a sense of¬†_purpose_.\n2.  **Rules** that place limitations on¬†_how_¬†players can achieve the goal‚Äîthese are unnecessary obstacles that players choose to tackle with their whole heart.\n3.  A¬†**feedback system**¬†that tells players how close they are to achieving the goal‚Äîthis lets players know that the goal is definitely achievable and provides motivation to keep playing.\n4.  **Voluntary participation**. All players must know and willingly accept the goal, the rules, and the feedback‚Äîplayers should be able to enter or leave the game at will to ensure the experience is safe and pleasurable.\n\n\u003e In a true game, the player isn‚Äôt only motivated by a future prize or reward. The player in a true game chooses to play out of _genuine interest_. **If you stripped away the points and prizes, the game would still be attractive.**\n\n\u003e Players came away feeling they had truly accomplished something _they_ wanted. **The reward of the game tied into something these people genuinely desired.**\n\nHere are 3 questions to keep in mind next time you want to create a true game:\n1.  **Is the goal of the game centered around the player‚Äôs authentic interest and skill set?**¬†‚Äú_You're looking for the challenge that's going to really bring the best out in people and really, when they achieve it, they feel like it was a meaningful and epic achievement._‚Äù‚ÄîJane McGonigal\n2.  **Are there unnecessary obstacles that players voluntarily choose to tackle?** In golf, for example, players have to insert a tiny ball into a tiny hole from a far distance using a club. It‚Äôs the most inefficient way to place a ball in a hole, and that‚Äôs precisely what makes the game interesting.\n3.  **Is there a reliable feedback system with opportunities for failure and improvement?** How do players track their progress? Are there real skills involved that players can get better at and improve with practice? Or is it an arbitrary leaderboard they are trying to move up?\n\nThe trick to creating a true game is ==figuring out what your audience is interested in== and ==tapping into those genuine challenges or desires.== It‚Äôs about coming up with a challenge that‚Äôs so immersive it puts players in a [flow state](https://fs.blog/2013/07/what-makes-you-happy/).

I‚Äôm humbled after I complete every new project, and as I stand there with a big silly grin on my face, I feel his presence and ap- proval.‚Äù\n\t- LOCATION: Page 112\n- My point is that as human beings, we have this slant to look to our work for significance we can only find in God. When we uncouple our work from God, work becomes a sort of god in and of itself.\n\t- LOCATION: Page 120\n- Because the curse drives us to God.

But where to begin?\n\u003e \n\u003e Perhaps the simplest beginning would be to say that our brokenness reveals something about who we are. Our sufferings and pains are not simply bothersome interruptions of our lives; rather they touch us in our uniqueness and our most intimate individuality.\n\n\u003e The way I am broken tells you something unique about me. The way you are broken tells me something unique about you. That is the reason for my feeling very privileged when you freely share some of your deep pain with me, and that is why it is an expression of my trust in you when I disclose to you something of my vulnerable side.\n\n\u003e Our brokenness is always lived and experienced as highly personal, intimate, and unique. I am deeply convinced that each human being suffers in a way no human being suffers. No doubt, we can make comparisons; we can talk about more or less suffering, but, in the final analysis, your pain and my pain are so deeply personal that comparing them can bring scarcely any consolation or comfort.\n\n\u003e In fact, I am more grateful for a person who can acknowledge that I am very alone in my pain than for someone who tries to tell me that there are many others who have a similar or worse pain.\n\n\u003e Our brokenness is truly ours. Nobody else's. Our brokenness is as unique as our chosenness and blessedness. The way we are broken is as much an expression of individuality as the way we are taken and blessed. Yes, fearsome as it may sound, as the Beloved ones, we are called to reclaim our unique brokenness, just as we have to claim our unique chosenness and blessedness.","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.739605357Z","tags":null},"/Sources/Hit-the-Emotional-Gym-The-Founders-Framework-for-Emotional-Fitness":{"title":"Hit the Emotional Gym - The Founder's Framework for Emotional Fitness","content":"## Information\n- **Source:** [[First Round Review]] [[Emily Anhalt]]\n- **Tags:** #mentalhealth #psychology #entrepreneurship\n### Highlights\n\u003e Anhalt worked to dig deeper by conducting an interpretive phenomenological analysis of more than 100 interviews with psychologists and entrepreneurs to identify what exactly it is that makes a founder emotionally fit. After analyzing the interviews and coding them by theme, she distilled her findings into seven traits: ==self-awareness, empathy, willingness to play, curiousity, mindfulness, resilience, effective communication==\n\n#### Traits\n##### Self-Awareness\n\u003e _Dr. Anhalt‚Äôs definition: Emotionally fit leaders are self-reflective. They understand their triggers and biases and continuously check in with themselves. They are patient, resilient and willing to be vulnerable with others. They can tolerate frustration and manage their emotions. They understand that the feelings they have about others have a lot to do with their own selves._\n\nHow to work on this trait:\n- Start with yourself and see what you‚Äôre transferring.\n\u003e ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs an interesting psychological phenomenon that I‚Äôm seeing a lot of right now called institutional transference,‚Äù says Anhalt. ‚Äú[[Institutional transference]] happens ==when we put feelings about something other than work onto our place of work, or vice versa.‚Ä¨== And it‚Äôs especially intense right now. We have a lot of feelings ‚Äî and not a lot of control. We also feel guilt for complaining when others have it worse, so our emotions have nowhere to go. They get disguised as other, more acceptable issues. Fears about the future morph into concerns your team isn‚Äôt pushing hard enough. Your fights with your co-founder might be coming from something you have going on at home. And we have no idea that some of these feelings might be about something else entirely.‚Äù\n- Get to therapy, if you can ‚Äî especially if ‚Äúnothing‚Äôs wrong.‚Äù\n\n##### Empathy\n\u003e Dr. Anhalt‚Äôs definition: Emotionally fit leaders can (and do) put themselves in others‚Äô shoes on a regular basis. They recognize that what they feel about things might not necessarily be what others feel, and they strive for empathy even when it is difficult. Although they must sometimes make unilateral decisions, they consider how those decisions will affect others.\n\n- Tap into how your team is feeling\n- Remember to fill your reserves\n\n##### Willingness to play\n\u003e Dr. Anhalt‚Äôs definition: Emotionally fit leaders understand and encourage the importance of play. Play sparks spontaneity and creativity, and is a crucial part of emotional health and interpersonal cohesiveness. Playing means trying on thoughts or concepts to see how they feel. It means having a free exchange of ideas and meeting of the minds.\n\n\n##### Curiousity\n\u003e Dr. Anhalt‚Äôs definition: Emotionally fit leaders understand and tolerate the difference between what they want to be true and what is true, and they make it a habit to ask questions and be curious, even when the answers to those questions are uncomfortable.\n\n\u003e ‚ÄúThis might be unexpected, but I always tie this trait back to feedback,‚Äù says Anhalt. ‚ÄúCuriosity is often framed as this kind of solo quest. ‚ÄòI‚Äôm curious about this, so I'm going to research this and read that,‚Äô and so on. But I also think [[Curiosity is the best skill to counteract defensiveness]]. When someone comes to us with constructive feedback, often our first instinct is to defend ourselves or explain why they got it wrong. If instead we get curious and ask questions like, ‚ÄòTell me more about that?‚Äô or ‚ÄòWhat could I do differently next time?‚Äô ==we avoid this defensive reflex and open ourselves up to growth==.‚Äù\n\nTo solicit ongoing feedback and get a more thorough picture of what those around you are seeing, she suggests cultivating your ==listening skills.== Here are some tips that Anhalt has developed in her years working with clients as a therapist:\n- Remember that you don‚Äôt have to always use words to show you‚Äôre listening ‚Äî nods and facial expressions are often just as powerful.\n- Instead of focusing on what you‚Äôre going to say next, stay present in the conversation.\n- Allow for pauses and silence so the speaker can reflect on what they‚Äôre saying and expand upon it. The first thing a person says is often not what they really want you to know.\n- Don‚Äôt feel compelled to fix things or give advice right away. When in doubt, ask what the speaker needs ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs comfort, solutions or they‚Äôre just looking to vent.\n\n##### Mindfulness\n\u003e Dr. Anhalt‚Äôs definition: Emotionally fit leaders can sit with and process through discomfort. They are able to have tough conversations, be transparent about uncomfortable information, share complicated feedback and sit with a problem until it has been fully thought through.\n\n\u003e Anhalt likens strengthening mindfulness to how the practice of yoga involves holding your body and settling into poses that might feel uncomfortable in the moment. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre making a decision or taking an action purely to move away from discomfort, take a moment to reflect on whether the discomfort is really so intolerable. Sit with it for a while, take a deep breath and prove to yourself that you can handle it. You do not need to break every silence, fix every issue immediately or avoid difficult conversations,‚Äù she says.\n\nSelf-care is one of the first things to go when times get tough, but if you want to lead and help others through times of struggle, you need to put on your own oxygen mask first. Here are four specific tactics Anhalt recommends:\n- Reflect on one thing you‚Äôre too hard on yourself about. Forgive yourself.\n- Think of one small thing people could do to support you this week. Ask for it.\n- Write down what you appreciate about three people you love. Send it to them.\n- Schedule a ‚Äúworry hour.‚Äù Block off a slot on your calendar where you get to be as worried as you want for that amount of time.\n\n##### Resilience\n\u003e Dr. Anhalt‚Äôs definition: Emotionally fit leaders know that more is to be learned from failure than success, and can bounce back during trying times and can take in difficult feedback. Their desire to grow is genuinely greater than their desire to avoid criticism or failure. They are flexible and can adapt quickly.\n\n\n##### Effective Communication\n\u003e Dr. Anhalt‚Äôs definition: Emotionally fit leaders are able to put words to their needs and expectations. They are able to talk through issues in a proactive, ongoing way. They can balance flexibility with maintaining their authority and appropriate boundaries.\n","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.739605357Z","tags":null},"/Sources/How-Engineers-Imaginaries-of-Healthcare-Shape-Design-and-User-Engagement":{"title":"How Engineers Imaginaries of Healthcare Shape Design and User Engagement","content":"## Information\n- **Source:** https://dl.acm.org/doi/full/10.1145/3577010\n- **Tags:** #design #AI #imaginaries\n- **Notes:** \n\n## Highlights\n- embedded ethics and social science approach: in which ethical, social, legal, and political analyses constitute integral elements of a product design process as well as in its field implementation.\n- We employed a qualitative, inductive, and interpretivist study design, following a grounded theory approach utilizing an iterative process for data collection and analysis.\n- study is based on participant observations and qualitative interviews.","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.739605357Z","tags":null},"/Sources/Images-of-Integrity-Across-the-Great-Divide":{"title":"Images of Integrity - Across the Great Divide","content":"## Reference\n- **Source:** [[Parker Palmer]]\n- **Keywords:** [[Cards/permanent notes]]\n\t- #personaldevelopment \n- **Relevant Notes:** \n\t- [[Cards/The Divided Life]]\n## Notes\nYour¬†**third required reading**¬†will get you to reflect on why we live such divided lives. This is taken from the book called \"A Hidden Wholeness\" written by Dr. Parker Palmer.\n\n### Reflection Questions\n-   **What are some characteristics of [[Cards/The Divided Life]]?** ^3a4c8e\n\t- We refuse to invest ourselves in our work, diminishing its quality and distancing ourselves from those it is meant to serve\n\t- We make our living at jobs that violate our basic values, even when survival doesn't demand it\n\t- We remain in settings/relationships that steadily kill of our spirits\n\t- We harbor secrets to achieve personal gain at the expense of other people\n\t- We hide our beliefs from those who agree with us to avoid conflict, challenge, and change\n-   **What was the purpose of Palmer's comparison between children and adults?** ^a09fa4\n\t- It shows us that our lives weren't always so divided; before, there was a time when we were truly in touch with our souls.\n\t- However, we slowly became masked and armored adults when the outer world became more demanding for us, forcing us to play a role withdrawn from our souls\n-   **What did Palmer mean when he talked about a¬†_masked and armored life_? Why do people live this kind of life?** ^a7a13f\n\t- The masked and armored life is a life where our roles (what we act as in the \"real world\") is divided from our souls (who we truly are). This is what it looks like...\n\t\t- Sensing that something is missing in our lives and searching for it, not understanding that we are the ones who are missing\n\t\t- Feeling fradulent, even invisible, because we are not in the world as who we really are\n\t\t- The light that is within us cannot illuminate the world's darkness\n\t\t- The darkness that is within us cannot be illuminated by the world's light\n\t\t- We project our inner darkness on others, making \"enemies\" of them and making the world a more dangerous place\n\t\t- Our inauthenticity and projections make real relationships impossible, leading to loneliness\n\t\t- Our contributions to the world -- especially through the work we do -- are tainted by duplicity and deprived of the life-giving energies of the true self\n\t- People live this kind of life because our culture has taught us that this is the safe and sane way to live.\n-   **Why do people need what Palmer calls¬†_[[Cards/Circles of Trust]]?_** ^eb6bfb\n\t- Community is essential to rejoining soul and role. This is what a circle of trust is for; it makes it safe for the soul to show up and offers us its guidance. Circles of trust support (rather than supplant) the individual quest for integrity. \n\t- These circles are rooted in 2 basic beliefs:\n\t\t- We all have an inner teacher whose guidance is more reliable than anything we can get from an external source (e.g. doctrine, ideology, collective belief system, institution, leader)\n\t\t- We all need other people to invite, amplify, and help us discern the inner teacher's voice for 3 reasons:\n\t\t\t- The journey toward inner truth is ==too taxing== to be made solo: lacking support, the solitary traveler soon becomes weary or fearful and is likely to quit the road.\n\t\t\t- The path is ==too deeply hidden== to be travelled without company: finding our way involves cues that are subtle and sometimes misleading, requiring the kind of discernment that can happen only in dialogue\n\t\t\t- The destination is ==too daunting== to be achieved alone: we need community to find the courage to venture into the alien lands to which the inner teacher calls us\n\n### Highlights\n\u003e As we become more obsessed with ==succeeding==, or at least surviving in that world, we lose touch with our souls and disappear into our roles.\n\n\u003e The divided life is the wounded life, and the soul keeps calling us to heal the wound. Ignore that call, and we find ourselves trying to numb our pain with an anaesthetic of choice, be it substance abuse, ==overwork,== consumerism, or mindless media noise.","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.739605357Z","tags":null},"/Sources/In-Online-Ed-Content-Is-No-Longer-King-Cohorts-Are-Essay":{"title":"In Online Ed Content Is No Longer King - Cohorts Are - Essay","content":"## Information\n- **Source:** [[Wes Kao]]\n- **Tags:** #content #education \n- **Notes:**  [[Miscellaneous Notes/Literature Notes/In Online Ed Content Is No Longer King - Cohorts Are - Literature Notes]]\n\n## Highlights\n\u003e post-content age\n\n\u003e educational content is cheap and abundant on YouTube, in newsletters, on blogs, and on social media.\n\n\u003eIn addition, dozens of accelerators, incubators, low-cost or free online courses, and alternative education programs have popped up to serve working professionals who want to learn.\n\n\u003e it‚Äôs become nearly impossible for instructors to break out ‚Äî let alone make a living ‚Äî off their expertise, [as they‚Äôve been told they can](https://a16z.com/2019/10/08/passion-economy/).\n\n\u003e most learners are actually _worse_ off for all this cheap, abundant content ‚Äî it‚Äôs become clear over the years that ==more access does not translate to more engagement.==\n\n\u003e Many of the online course providers that gained prominence in the aughts sold the pretense that customers could learn anything, but relied on the ==learners‚Äô willpower and motivation== to stick through a course. It‚Äôs a familiar pattern in other self-directed programs, too: Anyone can access a workout and diet plan, but very few actually stick with it long enough to see results.\n\u003e \n\u003e Similarly, MOOCs ‚Äî the massively open online courses that were popularized in the 2010s and continue in other modern forms today ‚Äî offer evergreen, on-demand, recorded videos, often with a defined syllabus program. But their completion rate, as has been widely reported, is just ==3 to 6 percent==\n\n\u003e The key difference between this phase of online ed and the MOOCs in the past decade? ==They are engaging and _real-time,_ not just self-paced, and involve community-driven, active learning, as opposed to solo, passive content consumption. ==Cohort-based courses have a fixed start and end date, enforcing the real-time aspect and creating a scarcity within the abundance of content out there, and are often taught live. It‚Äôs the equivalent of participating in a college discussion seminar ‚Äî taught by an expert in the field, unconstrained by geography or school rank ‚Äî as opposed to watching a static video. And, importantly, there‚Äôs a built-in social contract in the form of the cohort.\n\n### MOOCs v.s. CBCs: The shift from content to communities\n\n\u003e But while these platforms provided access to both creators and learners, they didn‚Äôt deliver on the promise of ==student transformation. ==\n\nReasons why this pledge was naive: \n+ **MOOCs are asynchronous and self-paced**.\n+ **MOOCs‚Äô low (or no) cost colors the perception of quality**.\n+ **MOOCs convey ‚Äúknowledge transfer,‚Äù but not necessarily higher-order skills**.\n\n\u003e MOOCs are great for subjects that are primarily ‚Äúknowledge transfer,‚Äù such as how to sort data in Excel or other such skills. But ==they‚Äôre not great for higher-order skills==‚Äîthose that require analysis, evaluation, synthesis, judgment, and creativity. Continuing with the Excel example, a higher-order version might involve how to segment the data strategically to look for patterns and arrive at a recommendation.\n\n\u003e To summarize: On many MOOC platforms, the dominant learning modality is ==passive content consumption==; there‚Äôs no interaction or real community; and there‚Äôs no time constraint. All this amounts to a tiny [percentage](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereknewton/2020/06/21/the-depressing-and-disheartening-news-about-moocs/?sh=60625de976ed) of learners who actually follow through.\n\n### The case for cohort-based courses\n\n![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20210723014812.png]]\n\n#### CBCs focus on active, hands-on learning\n\u003e Students have to put in more effort through this format; they‚Äôll stumble and make mistakes. While this is inarguably harder than listening to a charismatic ‚Äúsage on stage‚Äù lecturer ‚Äî where some students in the same study even perceived themselves to be [retaining more knowledge](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2019/09/study-shows-that-students-learn-more-when-taking-part-in-classrooms-that-employ-active-learning-strategies/) when taught by ‚Äúsuperstar lecturers‚Äù than they actually were ‚Äî the research showed students actually [learned more](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2019/09/study-shows-that-students-learn-more-when-taking-part-in-classrooms-that-employ-active-learning-strategies/) from the hands-on experience.\n\n![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20210723014948.png]]\n\n\u003e From the professional‚Äôs standpoint, cohort-based courses also bring the network benefits of startup accelerators to a wider market. ==The value in accelerators isn‚Äôt just content, it‚Äôs community.==\n\n#### Live, bi-directional learning leads to more accountability\n\n\u003e In his book [_Cooperative Learning_](https://www.amazon.ca/Kagan-Cooperative-Learning-Grades-450pp/dp/1879097109), the clinical psychologist and professor of psychology Spencer Kagan argues that the single most powerful approach to comprehension and retention is ==interactive processing, which occurs when ‚Äústudents engage in interaction with partners or teammates over the content.‚Äù== Part of the reason that this approach is so powerful is that classroom discussions and debates produce new ideas and points of view; that back-and-forth holds student attention in a way that no lecture can.\n\n\u003e Another reason cohort-based courses can have more accountability is that they are bi-directional, as opposed to one-way, meaning there‚Äôs an exchange of knowledge between the instructor and students, as well as students with fellow students. ==It‚Äôs a [dialogue, not a static lecture](https://www.weskao.com/blog/the-state-change-method).==\n\n![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20210723015209.png]]\n\n\u003e Studies also show that what psychologists and neuroscientists call ==‚Äúinterleaving‚Äù learning ‚Äî where instructors mix different topics, ideas, and activities together during study, forcing students to intentionally switch between them rather than focusing on a single subject ‚Äî can result in better learning outcomes for students.== A Brazilian jiu jitsu athlete, for instance, alternates practice between chokes, locks, escapes, and take-downs. Cohort-based courses are inherently about interleaving, giving students a chance to engage in different modalities ‚Äî breakouts, role-playing, discussions, debates ‚Äî with the instructor, coaches, and each other.\n\n#### Community building improves learning outcomes through social features\n\n\u003e When designing cohort-based courses, I also deeply researched institutions outside education ‚Äî [the military, dance-a-thons, Crossfit, and even cults ‚Äî to understand the motivation of groups.](https://twitter.com/wes_kao/status/1275825916325908481?s=20) All of these were ‚Äústicky‚Äù for their participants (for better or worse). But where most traditional education forces students to learn, it‚Äôs clear that continuing education and adult learning must be compelling and carrot-driven, not stick-driven.\n\n\u003e Why pay $750 to $5,000 for a cohort-based course when you can take a MOOC for $10 to 50?\n\n\u003e Cohort-based courses self-select for learners who are willing to (and can) pay a premium for the perceived quality of content and follow-through. Most learners likely need the accountability and urgency that comes from the time constraints of a live course (with a clear beginning and end date), and from learning with a peer group.\n\n#### A new model for creator monetization\n\n\u003e monetizing their expertise is really hard, especially if they don‚Äôt have existing followings or networks.\n\n\u003e traditional social platforms ‚Äî Instagram, TikTok, Twitter ‚Äî create a division between the activities intended to monetize and those meant for community building. Creators give away valuable content, but most don‚Äôt have the volume needed to make a living from advertising alone.\n\n\u003e Cohort-based courses provide a compelling way to monetize their expertise directly ‚Äî and without requiring volume. It may therefore be the next phase of creator monetization, not just for classic educators, as more ‚Äúknowledge‚Äù influencers run cohort-based courses. Cohort-based learning opens up a new quadrant of creator monetization:\n\n![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20210723020054.png]]\n\n+ **Instructors can make a healthy amount of money**\n+ **Creators get more leverage with a productized offering**\n+ **Consumers get more payoff, creators get higher monetization potential and scalability**","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.739605357Z","tags":null},"/Sources/Information-Architecture-Class":{"title":"Information Architecture - Class","content":"## Information\n- **Tags:** #design \n\n## Notes\n-  [[Miscellaneous Notes/Daily Notes/2020-09-15]]: Introduction to Information Architecture","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.739605357Z","tags":null},"/Sources/Inner-Compass":{"title":"Inner Compass","content":"## Reference\n- **Source:** [[Margaret Silf]]\n- **Keywords:** [[Cards/permanent notes]]\n\t- #religion #spirituality #personaldevelopment \n- **Relevant Notes:** \n\t- [[Cards/Desire]]\n\t- [[Cards/Disordered attachments]]\n\n## Notes\nYour¬†**fourth required reading**¬†discusses¬†**attachment**,¬†which is a serious obstacle from good discernment, and how to counter it with¬†**detachment**.\n\nMargaret's book¬†_Inner Compass: An Invitation to Ignatian Spirituality_¬†deals, among other things, with the issue of attachments and learning how to detach from them in order for one to make a sound discernment.\n\n### Reflection Questions\n-   **Why does Silf call attachment as \"being hooked?\" What does being \"hooked\" do to a person?**\n\t- Being hooked...\n\t\t- ...takes up all of our energy and attention\n\t\t- ...distorts us, making us stiff and lopsided\n\t\t- ...is exhausting, straining, stiffening\n\t- Being \"hooked\" makes us feel a lot of turmoil and anxiety...all these feelings are warning signals issued by our spiritual musscles to tell us that our Who center, our real self, is ==not designed for such dependency==\n\t\t- Related to the function of pain in our body (See [[Cards/The True Self]])\n\t- Letting go of the hook may be painful at first (falling onto the cold hard ground)...but it makes us free to move on our own again\n\t\t- \"It is a hard-won and painful freedom, but it is freedom, and it signals growth.\" [[Cards/We grow when we let go]]\n\t\t- The importance of wonder...of being open to possibilities outside of this hook (See [[Cards/Absolute Certainty versus Wonder]])\n-   **What does our deepest desire have to do with detachment?

In 2004, the most common answer was \"zero\". We now have fewer friends across class, racial, economic, and political lines, because we have fewer friends -- period. And as you just discovered for yourself, **the fewer ==\"repeat interactions\"== there are, the more distrust will spread.** \n\n\u003e With a ==lower \"win-win\" reward==, **cheating** takes over. Game theory has two powerful ideas about this: \n\u003e **\"Zero-sum game\".** This is the sadly common belief that a gain for \"us\" must come at a loss to \"them\", and vice versa. \n\u003e **\"Non-zero-sum game\".** This is when people make the hard effort to create a win-win solution! (or at least, avoid a lose-lose) ==Without the non-zero-sum game, trust cannot evolve.== \n\n\u003e This is why ==\"miscommunication\"== is such an interesting barrier to trust: **a little bit of it leads to forgiveness, but too much and it leads to widespread distrust!** I think our modern media technology, as much as it's helped us increase communication... has increased our miscommunication much more. \n\nGame theory shows us the three things we need for the **evolution of trust**:\n1. Repeat interactions\n2. Possible win-wins\n3. Low miscommunication\n\n\u003e **What the game is, defines what the players do.**\nOur problem today isn't just that people are losing trust,\nit's that our *environment* acts against the evolution of trust. \n\u003e That may seem cynical or naive -- that we're \"merely\" products of our environment -- but as game theory reminds us, we are each others' environment. **In the short run, the game defines the players. But in the long run, it's us players who define the game.**\n\u003e So, do what you can do, to ==create the conditions necessary to evolve trust.== Build relationships. Find win-wins. Communicate clearly. Maybe then, we can stop firing at each other, get out of our own trenches, cross No Man's Land to come together...\n\nLearn to live and let live.\n\n#### Van Gogh\nhttps://www.brainpickings.org/2014/12/01/van-gogh-purpose-letter/\n\u003e ‚Äúit is not necessary to accept the choices handed down to you by life as you know it.‚Äù\n\n\u003e On the road that I‚Äôm on I must continue; if I do nothing, if I don‚Äôt study, if I don‚Äôt keep on trying, then I‚Äôm lost, then woe betide me.

Where **meaning** stems from\n2. How we can design our own perceptions of the world to generate more meaning\n3. How we can create **value** both for ourselves and the communities of which we are a part\n\n### Brief\nMay Li begins by speaking about her mixed ancestry and the effect this has had on her approach to, and understanding of, value and meaning.\n\n\u003e \"Instead of thinking of life as a series of checks which I need to tick off - something which can be displayed on a graph that climbs ever up and to the right - ==I like to think of my life as a canvas which I can paint with whatever weird artwork I feel like== [...] Here is my mandatory Venn diagram: ==the status quo needs to change, and life is short.== When we put these two together, we can see that we need to subvert the status quo and have as much fun as possible along the way!\"\n\nThe point of meditation is not to get \"good\" at sitting around, thinking about nothing: ==it is to turn your life into a meditative one. Every act itself a meditation.== May Li talks about it in terms of turning the living of life into an artwork. The question is, what is the primary means we have a making art of our lives? This course will contend that it is *designing dialogue.*\n\n**In an empire of lies, telling the truth is a revolutionary act. In a fearful society; ==love and trust are the primary tools of resistance.==**\n\n==Play allows us to create and share ownership of spaces in ways which competition cannot.== This is why we have unicorns and dancing developers and silly memes: it's not something incidental. It is a fundamental part of what borderless, global history-writing based on consensus is about. The revolution is not being televised because it's not about hate or anger or violence or anything else that grabs the headlines of a media operating with skewed incentives. It's ==heart to heart==, here in the prison yards where we're using matching funds to build playgrounds where we can love again.\n\nTL;DR: **True play allows us to...** subvert the status quo. Have as much fun as possible along the way. Turn life into a canvas, rather than a graph with checkpoints. Welcome everyone. Eat great food. Enjoy dominoes again.\n\n### Small things\n\u003e ==\"When you do these little, joyful subversions remember that they can be really small. They don't have to be these grandiose events with hundreds or thousands of people.== When face-tracking came out, I managed to sneak little pink hearts into your Mac. At that time, there wasn't a lot of pink happening at all [laughs] It makes me happy to think I got Steve Jobs to approve this while pink hearts were coming out his head. Another example is the Technics 1200 turntables as your avatar - iconic in hip hop - and some other Easter eggs which are still in MacOS.\"\n\nMay Li goes on to talk about Scribble Together and her approach to presentation. One of the examples she uses is the ability to \"stamp multiple unicorns\". ==Everything is connected.==\n\n### Experiment with format\n\u003e \"Another thing you can do is experiment with format [...] For instance, using this traditional talk format to instead make everyone dance [...] Another one is subverting technology. This one is pretty profound. We talk a lot about the epidemic of loneliness [...] somehow, we have accepted the fact that computation has to be locked behind these little rectangles [...] ==How many years are we into the journey of computers and yet we still accept that we can get locked into things like this!?== What would happen if we turned computers inside out? There's an organization called DynamicLand which does exactly this. ==It's like cooking or scrapbooking; except it's all software and we're building things together.\"==\n\nIt's worth knowing a little bit about [Bret Victor](https://tinyurl.com/worriedream) and the work him and people like him are doing on computation as a concept and practice, rather than just writing more software in a linear, boxed-in kind of way. Stay with this until May Li makes it rain purple across everyone's prototypes with a Prince override. \n\n### Create a space\n\u003e \"Creating a space for change does not necessarily mean you're doing it yourself; ==you're just making it possible for others.==\"\n\nI once had a friend who told me, \"I'm not all that interested in Jesus, you know. I'm much more interested in what on earth was going on with that water he walked on!\" ==By which he meant that real miracles occur when you provide the environment for others to achieve seemingly miraculous things.==\n\n### Minding Symbolism\n\u003e \"When you think about dominant narrative and the status quo, symbolism is a big part of that, because ==a lot of how we relate to each other is through symbols and stories.==\"\n\n### Building on history\n\u003e \"I think change is rarely straightforward and, unlike the covers of magazines tend to show, it doesn't happen with one person on their own. ==We have a lot of room to build on history, to build on all the tremendous work of people before us who have striven for a better world.== One group of people who did something that was pretty important were the Black Panthers. One thing people don't realise about them is that they instituted a free breakfast program for children. We talk a lot about education and all the different statistics and projects there, but if people come to class hungry they cannot learn [...] This free breakfast program actually ended up being the blueprint for the Federal free breakfast program which happens today.\"\n\nMay Li uses this example to discuss the People's Kitchen Collective.\n\n\u003e \"These are recipes of resilience. ==The strength of our communities is, at its heart, based on the meals we share together.==\"\n\n**TL;DR: What are the five ways in which we can joyfully suvert the status quo?**\n1. Do small things.\n2. Experiment with format.\n3. Create space (not products!).\n4. Mind symbolism.\n5.

I thought, 'hmmm, what would happen if our **incentive** structures were a little different?' I wanted to democratize learning too, so the **mission** was really profound for me.

The most simple, seemingly silly questions are almost always the most profound.\n2. Good questions must come from a sincere desire to learn, rather than as a veiled means of stating your own opinion.\n3. Experts rarely ask good questions. Be a beginner, always.\n4. Questions are an opportunity to be humbled. Asking good questions is indistinguishable from *practicing humility.*\n5. Own up to what you don't know. It will set others free and you may end up coming closer to the shared truths which are a hallmark of honest conversation between peers.\n6. Close listening and clear attention are **preconditions** for good questions.\n7. A real master is the pupil in the eye of the world. Don't be afraid of letting others teach you; it does not degrade you, it uplifts you. The ego doesn't always acknowledge this simple truth.\n\n+ Asking better questions is about process and **practice**\n\t+ Skill, not innate trait\n+ Applies to KERNEL's thinking methodology\n\t+ being able to identify patterns of meaning through complementary opposites -\u003e being able to ask better, simpler, and more direct questions\n+ Honest conversations contain shared truths that create value\n+ Starting point to ask yourself: \"What goes this really *mean*?\"\n\t+ About whether **you** can understand basic principles\n\t\t+ If you can't, it's either because:\n\t\t\t+ it's not a well-formed idea (then move on)\n\t\t\t+ or you need to learn a new skill in order to understand its implications\n+ How do you develop a willingness to learn? It begins with clarity and honesty about what you don't know.\n\t+ This makes you more incentivized to improve yourself, because no one likes feeling inelt (even though we all are)\n+ Experience the benefits of beginner's mind, not conceptually, but in the actual course of your life\n\t+ About starting now, trying for yourself, being frustrated by your lack of expertise, and letting your heart show your mind how to celebrate this fecund state of not-knowing - for therein lies ==both truth and liberation.==\n\n### 68 Life Lessons\n[68 Bits of Unsolicited Advice from Kevin Kelly](https://kk.org/thetechnium/68-bits-of-unsolicited-advice/)\n\n### Questioning \"Better\" Questions\n[Corey Petty](https://thebitcoinpodcast.com/) and Justin B question the claim made in point 3 above. The debate boils down to whether asking good questions in general is an ability best developed through disciplined exercise of rational skill, or the cultivation of \"beginner's mind\". In particular, techniques like [the Socratic Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_method) develop rational inquiry in order to fuel deeper, more intuitive understanding of a given topic. Corey writes:\n\u003e ==Experience and reflection, learning from our mistakes, and developing understanding all provide nuance.== A mechanic doesn't develop his ability to diagnose a problem solely from introspection. It is through the combination of knowledge and understanding that intuition arises. I've spent most of my life honing skills that give me broad and deep understanding for the *specific purpose* of being able to ask good questions in any context.\n\nOr Justin B:\n\n\u003e I feel that ==knowledge of the specific==, e.g. computer science, translates directly into ==intuition around the general.==\n\nThe mechanic or scientist's skill does grow more nuanced through acquisition of knowledge and skill by the exercise of discipline, and this does lead to ==more specific questions about utility.== In this way, honing a skill leads to asking questions about that particular discipline, which is a good thing. So, let us add an 8th point:\n\n**8. Asking good questions requires a deep appreciation of context.**\n\nHowever, \"beginner's mind\" is not opposed to rational inquiry and the honing of skill: it is, in fact, the pinnacle of such discipline. Consider the Socratic method more closely:\n\n\u003e Socratic Circles are based upon the interaction of peers. The focus is to explore multiple perspectives on a given issue or topic. Socratic questions are open-ended, focusing on broad, general ideas rather than specific, factual information. ==The technique emphasizes a level of questioning and thinking where there is no single right answer.==\n\n+ Rational inquiry demands a diagnosis; a solution; an end to a process which had its beginning in the mind. \n\t+ What can such a mind do in the face of \"no single right answer\"? It can develop [negative capability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_capability), but even this is insufficient, because ==we're not after skillful intellectual understanding: we seek harmonious and clear ways of living.== And life is not only rational.\n+ Accepting honestly your own limitations and inability to understand everything that happens around you creates the space within for curiosity. \n\t+ You can genuinely enjoy never knowing what's going to happen next, which leads to asking questions which come from the heart and go to the heart of the subject being questioned.\n\t+  It is, as Paul Myburgh says, ==perceptual rather than conceptual: simple knowledge of things-as-they-are.==\n\n\n## Money and speech\n\u003e \"Put your money where your mouth is!\"\n\nA tamperproof, borderless, ownerless, global record is a new way of simultaneously ordering both which ==makes possible valuable==, ==meaningful communication== with anyone, anywhere in any way we care to program it. TL;DR: **a new kind of money and language.**\n\n### Magic internet meaning\n\n+ Our [narratives](https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-0/conversation) and [financial records](https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-1/value/#narrative) were clearly distinct before 2009\n\t+ But share common language from twin practices of [faith and finance](https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-1/playdough-protocols/#faith-and-finance)\n+ Money as a programmable protocol that relies on a **shared record** no-one owns is a development of the *order* of language\n\t+ Collapses distinction between ==narratives around which we organize== and ==our record of societal debt==\n+ Meaningful communication is a balance between the ==fact that your *ability* to speak ought to be free==, with the ==fact that you don't get to say whatever you please.==\n\t+ Freedom of speech enshrined as a constitutional good\n\t+ Implement error-handling for exceptions like hate speech and defamation\n+ Your ability to [access the network](https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-0/money-language/#open-protocols-and-a-network-of-value) (like TCP/IP) is free in all senses, ==requiring only a connection that can support you speaking in the same language as your peers. ==\n\t+ Protocols capable of processing valuable narratives (e.g. Bitcoin and Ehereum) render interperive balancing acts (negotiation, communication) unnecessary\n\t+ Saying anything *meaningful* (i.e. state-changing) has a specific, well-defined economic cost, captured in transaction fees which accrue to the benefit of those who \"listen\" to what you have to say.\n+ The **primary benefit** of this new order of econo-linguistic network we now communicate with: \n\t+ everyone is simultaneously free to speak \n\t+ the cost of any kind of meaningful speech is well-defined everywhere. \n+ We are also provided with a clear definition of meaning: ==any speech act which changes the state of our shared record.==\n\n### Regulation vs expense\n+ In blockchains, speech and execution are *one and the same thing* and interpretation is deterministic.\n+ Protocol has bare minimum of rules required for consensus\n\t+ You cannot double spend a token\n\t+ Every peer processes every transaction which passes these rules without fear or favor\n+ The context is determined not by legal interpretation, but by **economics.**\n\t+ Enshrining an ideal like \"free speech\" which we agree is good -\u003e certain behaviours we agree to be malicious are made prohibitively expensive\n\t+ They are not disallowed, just economically unsustainable, in much the same way that ==prevention is better than any cure.==\n\t+ Related: Vitalik's [Devcon 1](https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-1/understanding-ethereum/) talk\n+ [Programming penalties rather than rewards](https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-6/serenity/#proving-stake) ensures that the only state transitions worth validating are those that maintain a meaningful consensus. \n\t+ It is a profound change in ==how we regulate expression.==\n+ Complementary opposites: See [[Sources/Kernel/Kernel Learn Track - Module 0]]\n\u003e The most effective way to free meaning is to price it correctly.\n\n### Math beats bureaucracy\n+ Pricing different kinds of speech appropriately, rather than trying to \"protect\" a culturally-conditioned ideal, has the ==second-order cybernetic effect of better securing public goods. ==\n\t+ Cybernetics is a transdisciplinary and \"antidisciplinary\" approach concerned with regulatory and purposive systems‚Äîtheir structures, constraints, and possibilities. The core concept of the discipline is ==circular causality or feedback‚Äîthat is, where the outcomes of actions are taken as inputs for further action.==\n\t+ E.G. SSTOREs are a relatively expensive operation/expression because storing data on public networks is costly, and it is a cost borne by all of us.\n\t\t+ Thus, we agree upon a gas price that incentivizes developers to write contracts which store the minimum possible information required for state-changing, meaningful transactions.\n+ It could even be said that **there is no such thing as free speech** on freely accessible public blockchains\n+ Increasingly costly expression \u003c- increasingly complex kinds of meaning\n\t+ Incentives are programmed in such a way that the costs borne by the speaker are always provably more than those imposed on the community of listeners.\n\n### The expanded view\n+ The space of **meaningful communications** is greatly expanded when we stop \"protecting\" free speech\n\t+ price any speech act according to a ==set of explicit consensus rules== we all agree to follow\n+ We can **program** our shared ledger in any way we care to\n\t+ Favoring those in power = lack of creativity\n\t+ E.G. Gitcoin Grants and Quadratic Funding: a speech act which donates $1 to a cause can have nearly as great an effect as a donation two orders of magnitude larger, because we've [modelled clearly the most optimal way](https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-4/liberal-radical/#optimal-gathering) to fund public goods.\n\n\u003e When there is nothing to protect, we no longer need guards. Without guards, the digital world is not about captive audiences, but ==creative participation.==\n\n\n### Clarifying metaphors\nDespite the descriptive limitations of natural language faced with such a construction, we can still be precise about the exceptions to free speech \n1. **Hate speech** (analogous to malicious behaviour or outright attacks on the network) can be more elegantly handled when you are required to have [value-at-a-loss](https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-6/serenity/#a-defenders-game) to speak meaningfully.\n\t1. If you then violate rules which are not just social norms, but executable software, ==that value is slashed simultaneously with your speech== and you suffer provably more damage.\n2. **Defamation** comes in two flavours: *per se* (a statement that is obviously defamatory) and *per quod* (the defamatory implication must be proven).\n\t1. **Per se** defamation can be more elegantly handled by [mechanisms](https://our.status.im/discover-a-brave-new-curve/) like that which runs [dap.ps](https://dap.ps/). Anyone can vote in a way which \"defames\" a product or service, but that vote is also an economic signal denoted in tokens, which are sent straight back to the product or service. So, your downvote causes reputational damage while simultaneously repaying the people you're damaging (programmed according to a curve which makes votes cheaper the richer/higher the rank of whomever you're voting on is).\n\t2. **Per quod** defamation can be more elegantly handled either by some version of [negative votes](https://gitcoin.co/blog/gitcoin-grants-round-5-funding-our-future/) Gitcoin Grants is currently iterating over, or by reputational systems - hopefully [using profiles and actions](https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-4/self-enquiry/#identity-we-can-live-with) - yet to launch.\n3. The (in)famous [EIP-1559](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1559.md) is a great example of how we price transactional expression at the protocol level, which is where the most contentious [debates](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-2593.md) occur. Note, however, how such debate centres not on opinion, but engineering [trade-offs](https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-4/consensus/#1-lack-of-disagreement-is-more-important-than-agreement) and technical proof.\n\nThis new order of communication, akin to the appearance of language itself, is best demonstrated by:\n+ you need only memorize 12 magical **words**, incant them into an internet-connected machine and you gain immediate access to **monetary value**, anywhere in the world. \n+ One can even encode a reference to a newspaper headline in the genesis block of a network of timestamp servers (Satoshi's wording) which run money-as-a-protocol to make a permanent political statement. \n\n## Recollecting Our Origins\n[Shelling Out](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/shelling-out/)\n### How does this fit into Kernel?\n1. Reciprocal altruism and the problem of cooperation.\n2. The deep evolutionary links between **money**, mnemonics and genetic, generational memory.\n3. The importance of **incentive structures** to greater cooperation throughout human history.\n4. \nHow money has been used in situations of low **trust** to enable trade that would otherwise not have occurred.\n\n### Brief\n\u003e \"The precursors of money, along with language, enabled early modern humans to solve problems of cooperation that other animals cannot ‚Äì including ==problems of reciprocal altruism, kin altruism, and the mitigation of aggression.== These precursors shared with non-fiat currencies very specific characteristics ‚Äì they were not merely symbolic or decorative objects.\"\n\nSzabo begins with a story about the problems faced by the early colonists of America, who had limited access to the \"coin of the realm\", which was used to ensure they remained loyal subjects of the crown. They solved this by adopting the form of money used by the majority of Native Americans: wampum (or clam) shells. This strategy was so successful, and trade in wampum so widely accepted, that wampum became legal tender in New England from 1637 to 1661. Eventually the British shipped more coins to America and this practice ceased.\n\nThe language of money takes us back to well before recorded history, right to the very roots of homo sapiens sapiens, the wise ape capable of complex communication and its concomitant: ==the calculation of value.==\n\nThe precursors to money as we know it were used by people across the world to solve problems of **cooperation** in situations of low **trust**.\n\n### Reciprocal altruism\nThese strings of regular shells and other items may also have been used to satisfy our aesthetic tastes - made for sheer enjoyment. Far from an explanation, this raises a problem for evolutionary psychologists: why do people find the collection and wearing of jewelry enjoyable? What caused this pleasure to evolve? The critical question in all the theory is: **how did cooperative strategies evolve?**\n\n\u003e \"We will see that some humans, too, chose highly risky and discontinuous prey items, and shared the resulting surpluses with non-kin. Indeed, they accomplished this to a far greater extent than the vampire bat [...] Dawkins suggests, **\"money is a formal token of ==delayed reciprocal altruism==\"**, but then pursues this fascinating idea no further. We will.\"\n\nWe've established through Antonopoulos that [money is a language](https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-0/money-language) for communicating value, and that it was used long before writing was developed. This is now pushing to the heart of why language itself is useful at the biological, genetic level of our evolution: it fosters cooperation. In more technical terms, it allows us to overcome the value measurement problem - i.e. if you scratch my back in return for a piece of fruit, how long must you scratch for; how many ticks should you find; how big must the piece of fruit be; how do we remember who owes what in the case of delayed reciprocity? The cognitive overhead implied by this problem has never been overcome, except by *homo sapiens.*\n\n\u003e \"If clams can be money, furs can be money, gold can be money, and so on ‚Äì if money is not just coins or notes issued by a government under legal tender laws, but rather can be a wide variety of objects ‚Äì then just what is money anyway?\"\n\n\nMoney as a formal token of delayed reciprocal altruism, as an abstraction, and as a language has allowed human beings to overcome **==the value measurement problem.==**\n\n\u003e \"With money, there are only **n** prices ‚Äì 500 products, 500 prices. Money for this purpose can work either as a medium of exchange or simply as a standard of value ‚Äì as long as the number of money prices themselves do not grow too large to memorize or change too often.\"\n\nSzabo goes on to define early forms of money like wampum shells as \"collectibles\" and uses this to illustrate why \"people, clans or tribes trade voluntarily: because ==both sides believe they gain something.==\" Trade benefits from ==lowered transaction costs==, which are exactly where collectibles serve usefully, apart from their aesthetic or sentimental value. He describes:\n\n\u003e \"==how collectibles lowered transaction costs in each kind of wealth transfer== ‚Äì in the voluntary free gift of inheritance, in voluntary mutual trade or marriage, and in the involuntary transfers of legal judgments and tribute [...] Durable collectibles, what today we would call heirlooms, could persist for many generations and added substantial value at each transfer ‚Äì often making the transfer even possible at all.\"\n\n\u003e \"The Kula valuables doubled as \"high power\" money and **mnemonic for stories and gossip.** Many of the goods traded, mostly agricultural products, were available in different seasons, and so could not be traded in kind. Kula collectibles solved this ==double-coincidence problem== as an unforgeabaly costly, wearable (for security), and circulated (literally!) money. Necklaces circulated clockwise, and armshells counter-clockwise, in a very regular pattern.\"\n\n\u003e üí° ==Communicating value and transferring it are one and the same thing==; it's just that media which are not perfect abstractions - which have their own, intrinsic value - obfuscate this essential fact.\n\nThe primary benefit of using collectibles, with embedded narratives, as money is **lowered transaction costs.**\n\n### Communicative Wealth\nIn analyzing such wealth transfers, we need to keep two things in mind: ==**context**== (the time it occurs at and the supply/demand at that moment) as well as what Szabo calls the ==\"flow graph of monetary circulation\"== which allows collectibles to accrue value over time. E.G. Food is worth much more to starving people than to well-fed ones.\n\nHowever, the trust required to make the requisite trades was often lacking between tribes, and so ==collectibles substituted for otherwise necessary but non-existent long-term trust relationships. ==\n\nIn tandem with this kind of \"starvation insurance\", Szabo advances a ==theory of trade-based predation== - pointing out that many paleolithic tribes specialized in hunting only one kind of species, which often migrated seasonally, i.e. reindeer or bison. Importantly:\n\u003e \"It is not enough, for the theory of collectibles put forth in this paper to be correct, that single beneficial trades were possible. We must identify ==closed loops of mutually beneficial trades.== With closed loops the collectibles continue to circulate, amortizing their costs.\"\n\nCollectibles are not only useful for starvation insurance: they can be used to ==trade abstract foraging rights==, as is still the case with !Kung in Southern Africa today.¬†\n\nNevertheless the major point remains that underneath our great economic institutions are far more ancient institutions that also involved **wealth transfer.** Most importantly, this kind of transfer can be **passed between generations**: i.e. kin altruism beyond the grave.\n\n\u003e \"The ==demand for a durable and general store of wealth== for use in marriage, inheritance, dispute resolution, and tribute was thus even more urgent than for trade itself. Furthermore, these institutions may predate inter-tribal trade, and involved for most tribes a greater transfer of wealth than trade. ==These institutions, more than trade, served as the motivator and incubator of the earliest primitive money.\"==\n\nThis is a contentious argument, but the point remains that collectibles act as a ==container for memory== across generations, and our memories of who we are and what we owe extend far beyond mere trade relationships.\n\nIn order to achieve the lower transaction costs Szabo claims are a feature of money-as-collectibles, the collectibles must move in **closed loops** of mutually beneficial trade?\n\n### Mnemonics\n\u003e \"Often collectibles not only embodied wealth, but also served as a mnemonic, representing the title to a clan position of responsibility and privilege.\"\n\nThis has always been true, and in an even deeper sense that Szabo is getting at here. ==Wealth is itself a mnemonic==, perfectly illustrated by the fact that you now need only remember a 12 word mnemonic, which you can carry in your mind across any border in the world, in order to have immediate access to wealth. Szabo then discusses gifts and other forms of wealth transfer like family trade and marriage, putting particular emphasis on this notion of the closed loop of circulating collectibles, as well as tribute and the spoils of war. Again, when paying tribute:\n\n\u003e \"Collectibles doubled as a primitive mnemonic device that, while not verbatim, could be used as an aid to recall the terms of the [treaty](https://kernel.community/en/conversation).\"\n\nCirculating collectibles **highlight the link between money, language, mnemonics, and memory** (both individual and collective). ==Money contains the memories of our indebtedness to each other; narrative contains the memories of our indebtedness to life, the universe and everything.== What happens now that the two are merging?\n\nAnother critical point that comes up in the section on Spoils of War is that ==tribes would often hide wealth in order to reduce the tribute they were forced to pay.== This remains true today, albeit it in a more complex way. There is a very good reason we use the words \"shell corporation\". The innovation of a public, auditable, verifiable ledger changes this fundamentally, with hard-to-predict effects.\n\n### Taxes and coins\nSzabo uses these sneaky tribal tactics as a segue into the work of Arthur Laffer, who proved that ==as the tax rate increases, the amount of revenue increases, but at an increasingly slower rate than the tax rate,== due to increased avoidance, evasion, and - most of all - disincentive to engage in the taxed activity. This has become known as the ==Laffer Curve==:\n\n\u003e \"On a larger scale, the Laffer curve may be the most important economic law of political history. Charles Adams uses it to explain the rise and fall of empires. The most successful governments have been implicitly guided by their own incentives ‚Äì both their short-term desire for revenue and their long-term success against other governments ‚Äì to optimize their revenues according to the Laffer Curve. Governments that overburdened their taxpayers, such as the Soviet Union and later Roman Empire, ended up on the dust-heap of history, while governments that collected below the optimum were often conquered by their better-funded neighbors.\"\n\nThe main question about coins is why minting was dominated by governments as opposed to private interests - and the answer is not just the government's ability to enforce anti-counterfeit measures more effectively. It has to do with the fact that ==coins are high velocity money, facilitating a large number of low value trades.==\n\n\u003e \"The king, deriving his revenue from tax collection, had a strong incentive to measure the value of wealth held and exchanged by his subjects more accurately. That the exchange also benefited from cheaper measurement by traders of the medium of exchange, creating something closer to efficient markets, and allowing individuals to enter into the marketplace on a larger scale for the first time, was for the king a fortuitous side effect.\"\n\nBeing from the internet, we reject kings, presidents and voting; opting rather for rough consensus and running code. The question is ==whether we can have efficient marketplaces without central authorities such that the fortuitous side effects of global trade can accrue to the people actually trading, rather than the authorities \"allowing\" that trade to occur.==\n\nMoney helps humans solve the value measurement problem. Coins, as high velocity money, enable us to do this more efficiently. Traders in coins benefit, because measurement is **cheaper.**\nTake a moment to reflect on the cybernetic fact that ==money is about value measurement, and that measurement itself has a cost.==\n\n### Resolution\nHuman relationships of any kind generally require some kind of ==dispute resolution mechanisms== in order to be sustainable in the long term. Szabo tackles this thorny issue next:\n\u003e \"Most pre-modern cultures, ranging from the Iriquois in America to the pre-Christian Germanic peoples, decided that payment was better than punishment.\"\n\nThere is a lot more to be said about dispute resolution, but we selected this particular quote because it highlights a fundamentally important idea for Web 3: **can we advance the aims of rehabilitative justice using a shared and common historical record?** Because it's the perfect tool to do so. We can use economics to combat economic evils like the privatization of prisons. These are the kind of society-level changes we want you to think about, because they are, in principle, possible.\n\nThis takes us back to the primary importance of understanding this notion of collectibles:\n\u003e \"Indeed, collectibles provided a fundamental improvement to the workings of **reciprocal altruism**, allowing humans to cooperate in ways unavailable to other species. For them, ==reciprocal altruism is severely limited by unreliable memory.== Some other species have large brains, build their own homes, or make and use tools. No other species has produced such an improvement to the workings of reciprocal altruism. The evidence indicates this new development had matured by 40,000 B.P.\"\n\nSzabo goes on to discuss the properties of such collectibles and gives multiple examples of their development through history, basically linking up everything above. Importantly, he makes the point in the context of all this history, that\n\n\u003e \"A novelty of the 20th century was the issue of fiat currencies by governments. While generally excellent as a media of exchange, ==fiat currencies have proven to be very poor stores of value [due mainly to inflation].==\"\n\nIt's fascinating to consider the money we use today as a novelty, rather than a given. In any case, we then arrive at the conclusion:\n\n1. Collectibles were crucial in ==lowering transaction costs== such that our ancestors could trade between tribes and not just with kin, without succumbing to either the value measurement problem or the prisoner's dilemma.\n2. Collectibles entirely ==replaced reputation as the enforcer of reciprocation==, although violence still played a major role in enforcing rights as well as being a high transaction cost that prevented most kinds of trade.\n3. To be useful as a general-purpose store of wealth and means of wealth transfer, a collectible had to ==have certain functional properties and be embedded in at least one institution with a closed-loop cycle==, so that the cost of discovering and/or manufacturing the object was amortized over multiple transactions.\n4. With its ==unprecedented technology of cooperation==, humans have become the most fearsome predator ever seen on the planet.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.739605357Z","tags":null},"/Sources/Kernel/Kernel-Learn-Track-Module-3":{"title":"Kernel Learn Track - Module 3","content":"See [[Atlas/Maps/Kernel MOC]]\n## Take Back the Web\n+ Why did the initial visions for the world wide web not work out quite as their inventors intended?

Augmenting our ability to think for ourselves\n2. Reclaiming our time\n3. Extending our ability to co-operate\n\nTo establish our first pillar, we'll mix a [Vannevar Bush essay from 1945](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/) and a [2019 essay from Andy Matuschak and Michael Nielsen](https://numinous.productions/ttft/)\n\n### How does this fit into Kernel?\n+ Meaning of take back the web: \n\t+ the internet came with grand dreams\n\t+ though we're mostly stuck with artificial social spaces, overwhelming algorithms, and extractive **incentives** which are mining our attention as a means of propping up a failing economy.\n+ These two essays draw out a common thread of thought stretched across 74 years in order to illustrate what sorts of **freedom** are actually on offer in this world wide web of ours. \n\t+ Since 1945, one critical feature has revolved around ==constructing new media for free and creative thought.==\n\t+ At first it may seem unrelated to blockchains, but ==tools for thought are public goods and suffer from the same problem of incentives as all other public goods. ==\n\t+ They are thus the perfect example of common patterns for humanity which require us to understand why programming regenerative incentives matters, and what economic code can really be used to achieve in the long-term.\n\n\u003e \"The inheritance from the master becomes, not only his additions to the world's record, but for his disciples the entire scaffolding by which they were erected.\"\n\n### Brief\nVannevar Bush's essay begins as a plea for **cooperation** between scientists so as to make the shared record of human knowledge more **accessible.**\n\u003e \"The scientists, burying their old professional competition in the demand of a common cause, have shared greatly and learned much. It has been exhilarating to work in effective partnership [...] They have been part of a great team. Now, as peace approaches, one asks where they will find objectives worthy of their best.\"\n\n### Free yourself to work together\n\u003e \"There is a growing mountain of research [but we] cannot find time to grasp, much less to remember, all the conclusions of others as they appear. Yet specialization becomes increasingly necessary for progress, and the effort to bridge between disciplines is correspondingly superficial [...]\n\n\u003e \"The difficulty seems to be, not so much that we publish unduly in view of the extent and variety of present day interests, but rather that **publication has been extended far beyond our present ability to make real use of the record.**\"\n\nWe discussed how the record we use for establishing our shared history and for recording our transactions became [one and the same thing](https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-2/money-speech/#magic-internet-meaning) in 2009, but we have yet to attend to this central question: *how can we best use it?*\n\n\u003e \"A record if it is to be useful to science, must be **continuously extended**, it must be **stored**, and above all it must be **consulted.**\"\n\nSection 4: \n\u003e \"[Our technology must allow users] to **free their brains** for something more than repetitive detailed transformations in accordance with established rules [...] A mathematician is not one who can readily manipulate figures [...] S/he is primarily an individual who is skilled in the use of symbolic logic on a high plane, capable of intuitive judgment in the choice of the manipulative processes employed.\"\n\nSection 5 begins with the manipulation of logical processes beyond arithmetic and then dives into the final and most critical part the human record: **consultation.**\n\n### Selecting the trail\n\u003e \"We can enormously extend the record; yet even in its present bulk we can hardly consult it. This [...] involves the entire process by which man profits by his inheritance of acquired knowledge. The prime action of use is **selection**, and here we are halting indeed [...] Our ineptitude in getting at the record is largely caused by the artificiality of systems of indexing.\n\n\u003e \"[Instead of alphanumeric indices] the human mind [...] operates by ==association==. With one item in its grasp, it snaps instantly to the next that is suggested by the association of thoughts, in accordance with some intricate web of trails carried by the cells of the brain.\"\n\nBush introduces the ==\"memex\"== - a supplement to memory which pulls together microfilm, recording technologies, and associative selection. It won't be as fast or flexible as the brain, but it could at least improve the clarity and permanence of our recall.\n\n\u003e \"This is the essential feature of the memex. The process of tying two items together is the important thing [...] Thereafter, at any time, when one of these items is in view, the other can be instantly recalled merely by tapping a button below the corresponding code space.\"\n\nBush is really talking about ==building \"user trails\" through these associative indices.== In much the same way that one book is the associative trail of a mind moving through and selecting certain information; Bush has designed a machine to build trails of trails. These trails ==could also be shared:== my trail passed into your memex and vice versa - a far more efficient and less lossy means of collaboration than simply recommending a book or two.\n\n\u003e \"Wholly new forms of encyclopedias will appear, ready made with a mesh of associative trails running through them, ready to be dropped into the memex and there amplified [...] There is a new profession of trail blazers, those who find delight in the task of establishing useful trails through the enormous mass of the common record.\"\n\nBush then spends some time speculating on technologies which directly manipulate the human nervous system. He ends with this:\n\n\u003e \"[Science] may yet allow us truly to encompass the great record and to grow in wisdom. We may perish in conflict before we learn to wield that record for our true good. Yet, in the application of science to our needs and desires, it would seem to be a singularly unfortunate stage at which to terminate the process, or to lose hope as to the outcome.\"\n\nThe most critical aspect of useful shared records, and the one we are worst at is **consultation**. This requires that we improve at **selection** when working with information.\n\n### The mnemonic medium\n==Media for thought are all around us==: Bush cites the abacus which, through the positional display of number relationships it implies, led the Arabs to the concept of 0. ==Media for thought create powerful immersive contexts in which to explore new classes of ideas which were formerly impossible.== Matuschak and Nielsen take this much, much further.\n\n\u003e üí° If our media help us remember what matters, we may find our minds are already free.\n\n\u003e \"Alan Kay summed up the optimism of this dream when he wrote of the potential of the personal computer: 'the very use of it would actually change the thought patterns of an entire civilization' [...] for better and worse, computers have affected the thought patterns of our civilization over the past 60 years, and those changes seem like just the beginning.\"\n\nMedia for thought, like the abacus - or like money and writing - create ==powerful immersive contexts== (which can change the ==thought patterns== of civilizations).\n\nLeveraging the insights of cognitive science, we can create media that make it effortless to remember what you've read. The medium builds in the key steps involved in memory. In this context, it means adopting ==highly specialized flash cards== in an essay, and ==spaced repetition (SRM) reminders== after reading. These may sound trivial, but it takes advantage of a fundamental fact about human memory: ==as we are repeatedly tested on a question, our memory of the answer gets stronger, and we are likely to retain it for longer.==\n\nWhy all this focus on memory, though? Will building mnemonic media really free our thought? Remember, Bush showed how new media free our brains from rote tasks: mathematicians are not calculators, but people skilled at intuitively grasping higher order logic.\n\n\u003e \"Memory systems can be extraordinarily helpful for mastering abstract, conceptual knowledge [...] **because of the way the mnemonic medium embeds spaced repetition inside a narrative.** That narrative embedding makes it possible for context and understanding to build up.\"\n\nThe key in all this is how you craft the cards: the idea being to make a ==scalable *memory laboratory*== which can answer some very deep questions about human memory, how it might be improved and practiced, and what impact it can have on our thought and learning.\n\n\u003e \"We‚Äôll see that memory systems are a small part of a much bigger picture [...] Seriously developing memory systems is likely to lead to one or more transformative tools for thought.\"\n\n### Network structures for knowledge\n\nCritically, memory systems need to ensure that people don't just learn surface features; they need to help users in innovative ways when they do forget; and they need to encode stories into the mnemonic medium. In this sense, you can see the mnemonic media as ==carrying two texts: the actual one and the reflected one==, built up by all the knowledge encoded in cards.\n\nHowever, it is a mistake to think \"good memory system == spaced repetition\". There is also ==elaborative encoding== and the sort of ==associative trail==s Bush was talking about; and techniques like [the method of loci](https://www.ourmachine.net/writing/memory-i/), though this isn't as useful for remembering abstract, conceptual knowledge. Seeing this broader perspective allows us to ask much deeper questions, like:\n\n\u003e üí° What is the ideal network structure of knowledge?\n\nAnd what does memory have to do with *understanding* and *creativity*?\n\nConceptual mastery and creativity is actually enabled by a mastery of details. By largely automating away the problem of memory, ==the mnemonic medium makes it easier for people to spend more time focusing on other parts of learning, making the awkward early stages easier to get through.== The link between memory and mastery goes much deeper though, right down to the idea of **chunking**, as demonstrated with chess masters in the 1970's.\n\n\u003e \"Players learn to recognize somewhere between 25,000 and 100,000 **patterns of chess pieces.** These much more elaborate 'chunks' are combinations of pieces that the players **perceive as a unity**, and are able to reason about at a higher level of abstraction than the individual pieces [...] Memory is, in fact, a central part of cognition.\"\n\nMy sense is that having **transportable user trails**, like Bush imagined in '45, would be extremely useful. How to make this wealth of knowledge easily shareable? Just encode them as [12-word mnemonics](https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-2/shelling-out/#mnemonics) inside a [world computer](https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-1/understanding-ethereum/#generalised-compute)...\n\nCreativity is largely enabled by **mastery of detail.**\n\n### Designing insight\n\u003e \"The design and mathematical insights are inextricably entangled: the mathematical insights are, in some sense, design insights, and vice versa [... This is] a general truth: the most powerful tools for thought *express deep insights into the underlying subject matter* [... Mnemonic media] will express deep original insights into memory [...] A truly great memory system will be cognitive science of the highest order.\"\n\nThis general truth reveals the deep difference between what Alan Kay called \"pop\" and \"research\" cultures. ==Pop culture is great at producing products we consume, but is insufficient for creating new tools for thought.==\n\n\u003e \"This is not the common argument that making new tools can lead to new subject matter insights for the toolmaker, and vice versa. New tools can lead to ==new subject matter insights for *humanity* as a whole==, and vice versa, and this would ideally be a rapidly-turning loop to develop the most transformative tools.\"\n\n\u003e \"Doing this is a **cultural struggle.** It seems to be extraordinarily rare to find the ==insight-through-making loop working at full throttle== [...] You have brilliant researchers who think of making as something essentially trivial, 'just a matter of implementation'. And you have makers who don‚Äôt understand research, who see it as merely a slow and dysfunctional process.\"\n\n### Extending our mnemonics\n\u003e \"Watching this video is a remarkable **emotional** experience. It‚Äôs obvious the person narrating the video loves mathematics, and you cannot help but **empathize** [...] It‚Äôs tempting to overlook or undervalue this kind of emotional connection to a subject.

The law would never be able to give sufficient details to regulate a commons. A typical tree on the commons of a village has by custom very different uses for different people. The widows may take the dry branches for burning. The children may collect the twigs, and the pastor gets the flowers when it flowers, and the nuts from it are assigned to the village poor, and the shadow may be for the shepherds who come through, except on Sundays, when the Council is held in the shadow of the tree.\n\n\u003e The concept of the commons is not that of a resource; a commons comes from a totally different way of being in the world where it is not production which counts, but bodily, physical use according to rules that are established by custom, which never recognizes equality of all subjects because different people follow different customs. **Their differences can be recognized in the way they share the commons.**\n\n### Week 4 Firesides\n+ [Andy Tudhope](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijmmKr-ZjsU)\n+ [Mariano Conti](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtNvB6D2Emw)\n+ [Dandelion Mane](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djQhzNA9bzc)\n\n## Govern Yourself\nPeople think governance is hard.

Just abandon it** is a more apt slogan. \n\n### Rough consensus\n+ Anarchy does not mean the tyranny of structurelessness. To us, it means...\n\t+ ==sovereign individuals== collaborating of their own volition on projects they choose to undertake\n\t+ ==emergent forms of organization== that need not be permanent, because they're not premised on personal power, but rather arise as a response to the needs of a group in a particular moment.\n+ The best example of this kind of internet age governance is, unsurprisingly, the [IETF](https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-4/consensus):\n\u003e We reject: kings, presidents and voting.\n\u003e We believe in: rough consensus and running code.\n\n### Alegality\n+ Alegal systems are those that ==\"can't care\" about the human context== of the information they process\n+  Think back to [what is valuable](https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-1/value/#consensus) - the legal fiction of the firm (i.e. that it has a kind of personhood) allowed for orders of magnitude improvement in our organizational efficiency as a species.\n+  Alegal fictions are the next evolution. \n\t+ For the first time in history, we need not revolt against a ==system of violent legal enforcement. ==\n\t+ We can abandon it for ==openly verifiable mathematics==, which we subscribe to by acts of our own volition.\n\n\u003e üí° This is because, in the world wide web, running code is more powerful than holding elections.\n\n+ In exactly the same way that we obviate the need to trust protocols by defining and encoding what it means to cheat;

And that was with the ==introduction of Evernote to the public.== Broadly speaking, Evernote sped up our expectations for creating new notes, and for quickly navigating between notes.  \n  \nAs we gained the ability to make FAST notes, the rigidity of folders really started to show itself. The clunkiness of twirling down üìÇ X, then üìÇ¬† Y, then üìÇ¬† Z...all that clunkiness really started to interfere with the our adapting expectations to working with FAST notes (say, by just hitting cmd-n or ctrl-n).¬†  \n  \nFast forward several years. Along with FAST notes, Evernote came with other problems:¬†\n\n-   misguided business management practices\n-   invasive data mining\n-   feature-bloat\n\nAll of this made people ask questions.¬†\n\n-   What if I wanted to leave a piece of software?¬†\n-   Are my notes trapped?\n-   If I try to export my notes, what is the true cost I'll have to pay in terms of: time, attention, and emotion?\n\nMany of these are privacy concerns, that overlap with future-proofing concerns, that overlap with functionality concerns. And from these concerns, re-emerged an old analog method to solve these new digital problems.  \n  \n==The Zettelkasten method==; which is essentially writing FAST notes, on note cards, in your own words, one idea per card, with a link to another card. When this method is applied to our digital notes, the magic starts to happen. We can work as quickly as we can think‚Äîwhich is what we are fully adapted to nowadays. It's just what we expect.¬†  \n  \nBut the Zettelkasten method essentially ==abolishes folders.== You know, those things we all grew up with, and used for years. That's a pretty big radical shift. And yet, because the Zettelkasten method is so powerful, it's a shift many people are willing to make. And because people get results they like, they decide to completely abolish the folder. They \"throw the baby out with the bathwater\". But perhaps,¬†**_if we throw away the dogma surrounding the Zettelkasten method_**¬†(strict \"atomic\" notes), perhaps folders can still serve a purpose...and not only folders, but other higher-order notes that give us the structure we crave.  \n  \nThis time though, instead of using rigid folder-only structures, we now have the ability to use ==flexible \"fluid frameworks\".==\n","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.739605357Z","tags":null},"/Sources/LYT/1b3-Scaling-zettelkasten":{"title":"1b3 - Scaling zettlekasten","content":"\n[[Atlas/Maps/LYT 10 MOC]]\n\n---\n\nWhile the Zettelkasten Method has given us the power to make¬†**_fast_**,¬†**_atomic_**, and¬†**_linked_**¬†notes, ==it doesn't naturally give us enough structure.== It only links directly from note to note.

That's because the rigid folder-only system we all grew up with is stunting our ability to deftly, to masterfully, work with our knowledge. Whereas, link-based notes allow us to do just that.  \n  \nSo how can we become more masterful at using links?

You can use MOCs to overcome the **\"[[Mental Squeeze Point]]\"** \u0026 ensure you keep working proactively on your ideas and projects.  \n  \nJust assemble links to notes in a new MOC note.

After doing this over 100 or 1000 times, you may decide that a dedicated folder for timestamped notes is worth having.  \n  \n### ¬†Folders for **projects**\nIf your goal is to manage projects, folders are great ‚Äî maybe even ideal. You might decide that you want your projects to be actively walled-off from the rest of your notes.  But once projects are completed, you will need to take the extra steps of reformulating any good stuff into your main digital library.  \n  \n### Folder for an **inbox** (or **seedbox**)\nAnother possible use for a folder is as a temporary inbox, or ‚Äúincubation‚Äù folder. Just make sure you treat this folder as a temporary staging ground‚Äîto be deleted or assimilated with the Borg- er, I mean, your main-brain-frame. Otherwise, that inbox folder can get awfully crufty.¬†  \n### Folders for **special files**\nYou might want to have folders to keep your Images, PDFs, and other files better organized.  \n  \n### Folders for **\"very clearly defined\"** types of notes\nYou might want to use folders for ‚Äúvery clearly defined‚Äù notes. For example, things like: Images, People, and Quotes. You don‚Äôt have to use these folders; you could just add their contents into the main vault; but you might find it keeps things slightly more tidy.  \n  \n### Folders for your **sources**\nIf you want to have a special folder for People, you may also see value in having a special folder for Sources (all the things written by other people).¬†  \n\n### Folders for your **MOCs** and **datascopes**\nMaybe you really want to have a single place to view your most important structural notes in a familiar and comforting folder structure.¬†  \n  \n### Folders to clearly define what you **share with others**\nDepending on your needs and technical abilities, you can use folders to organize the notes you share publicly, versus the notes you want to keep private. A good example of sharing a folder publicly is the¬†[LYT Kit](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/), which is just a subfolder in my main PKM folder.¬†  \n  \n\n### Folders for **private notes**\nKeeping private notes private is crucial. You may choose to use folders to separate private information like finances, medical information, and private journaling.\n\n--- \n- Abolishing folders completely is an over-correction, a knee-jerk reaction, a rebellion against the parents of our digital upbringing.¬†  \n- There are still many valid uses for folder. Just don't fall into the trap of creating 50 folders and 100 subfolders in a single \"organizing\" frenzy; it won't work out.¬†  \n- There are many ways to use folders, but the best way to add new ones is to allow their need to emerge slowly through using your system.¬†  \n\n\u003e Structure has to be earned!\n  \nIf you find yourself thinking more than once that, \"a folder would be perfect here,\" then that's your cue to try one out, and see if it can earn a long-term role.","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.739605357Z","tags":null},"/Sources/LYT/1c4-Building-relationships-with-tags":{"title":"1c4 - Building relationships with tags","content":"\u003e The death of tags has been greatly exaggerated.\n\n- The problem is perspective.  \n- Again, we have Evernote to thank. Just like Evernote encourages its users to over-collect (using its excellent web clipper), it also encourages its users to ==over-tag‚Äîbut doesn't provide the tools to effectively manage with them.== After years of doing this, we became overwhelmed with the mess we created and some of us declared that tags are dumb.\n- But tags are not dumb. They're weak. And in their weakness is a strength far greater than we can easily imagine...  \n- But for tags to be strong, your note application needs to do three things.\n\t1.¬†**Auto-updating tags**: You can easily change the tag books to book in all of your notes.  \n\t2.¬†**Auto-completing tags**: You can just type a couple letters to get a list of suggested tags.  \n\t3.¬†**Nested tags**: To effectively manage tags, you can \"nest\" them in categories.\n- This is the¬†_Tag Trifecta_. They work together synergistically, which we will explore in later units.\n\n--- \n## Ways to use tags\nHowever you have thought about using tags, there are even more ways to use them. Here is an incomplete list to help us think about what is possible:  \n  \n### Tag by **topic** or **description**\nThis is the classic way to tag. This can be helpful for anytime you want to add a tag to¬†_describe_¬†something.¬†  \n- People worry this leads to a mess of tags (it can), but it won't if you use¬†_nested tags_.¬†\n    - For example, the parent tag #on can easily contain countless child tags:\n        - #on/pkm , #on/effort , #on/habit , etc.\n- It works well if you are comfortable allowing \"emergence\" to work for you over time.¬†\n\n### ÔªøTag the **status**\n- A popular strategy is to use tags as a status. For example: #todo, #doing, #done. Or something emergent like: #seedbox, #sapling, #evergreen.¬†\n- This works for some people, and for others it becomes \"yet another thing I have to maintain\". Your mileage¬†_will_¬†vary.\n\n### ÔªøTag **projects**\n- Instead of trying to tag every note with a status, you might decide to only put a status on projects. For example: #project/active, #project/soon.\n\n### ÔªøÔªøTag **spaces**\n- You likely have big \"spaces\" in your life. Your life stuff and your career (or business) stuff. Both spaces have \"meetings\" and \"people\", but you might want to have ways to separate the people in your personal life from the people in your business life.¬†\n\n### ÔªøTag by **noun**\n- What about things like meetings, people, outputs, sources, questions, and quotes? How do you plan to keep track these clearly defined things? Maybe you use tags like #meeting, #people, #output, #source, #question, and #quote.¬†\n\n### ÔªøTag for **chronological sorting**\n- You might find value in clicking a tag like #meeting and immediately seeing chronologically listed search results.\n\n### ÔªøÔªøTag for **exclusion**¬†\n- You could use a tag as more of an \"anti-tag\" that you filter out of your searches.\n- While the anti-tag sounds cool, anti-folders are often the better option because there is less janitorial work involved (less maintenance and databasing).\n\n### ÔªøTag for **queries** and **filters**\n- For power users who want to create all sorts of queries and filters, you can use tags (and other bits of metadata that sort of work like tags) to have ==fancy auto-generated tables to guide your efforts.==\n\n### ÔªøÔªøTag for **emergence**\n- Depending on your use case‚Äîand after you get more comfortable with nested tags‚Äîyou can effortlessly add tags without worrying about them. Over time, ==certain tags will \"rise to the top\"== (grow in number) and surprise you with a valuable area upon which to make into an MOC or related output.\n\n---\n## Pros and cons of tags + solutions\n- **Pros**\n\t- Tags are easy ways to ==quickly filter large swathes of notes.==\n\t- Tags are probably the most fluid framework with which to manage knowledge.¬†\n\t- One note can have multiple tags.\n- **Cons**\n\t- The problem is that ==tags¬†_alone_¬†don‚Äôt scale.==\n\t- Without some forethought, you may have multiple similar tags. (I strongly advise that all tags are singular. That means, don't use #sources. Instead just use #source.)\n\t\t- Say you have a¬†**_#source_**¬†tag. Whenever you take notes on something you read or watch, you apply that tag. It‚Äôs great when only 50 notes have that tag. But it‚Äôs far less useful when 500 notes have that tag, because now you have to scroll through and waste time trying to find \"that one note\".\n\n### Previous solution: **Multiple tags**\n- A partial solution is to use multiple tags to filter in only those results. So you can search for: #source #book \n- But there is a problem with this approach:  \n\t- You have to remember each tag.\n\t- It takes effort to correctly enter multi-tag searches.\n- That's where ==nested tags‚Äîalong with Auto-complete‚Äî==solve the issues with tags.\n\n### Better solution: **Nested tags**\n- Some software‚Äîlike Obsidian‚Äîallows for nested tags. Nested tags are really a no-brainer. They are a simple and powerful way to manage your tags.  \n- This image will show you some possibilities:\n\t- ![[Extras/Media/Images/Nested tags.png]]\n- Along with Auto-complete, I just starting typing boo and my note application suggests source/booküìö and I simply hit enter.\n-   When it comes to tags, no one really knows the whole story....

Sometimes this is intentional.  \n\n- **Random alphabetical proximity:**¬†\n    - The notes ‚ÄúApple‚Äù and ‚ÄúBandit‚Äù might start next to each other on Day 1. But their proximity in your folder is random, because over time it is subject to change. Years later the list might look like ‚ÄúApple‚Äù, ‚Äúaqua‚Äù, ‚Äúaqualung‚Äù, ‚Äúarabesque‚Äù, ‚Äúarachne‚Äù, ‚Äúarbiter‚Äù, ‚Äúarc‚Äù, ‚Äúarena‚Äù, ‚Äúaries‚Äù, ‚Äúarise‚Äù, ‚ÄúArkansas‚Äù, and then finally ‚ÄúBandit‚Äù.¬†\n    - So relationships that start out strong can weaken over time.\n- **Intentional alphabetical proximity:**¬†\n    - You prepend all of your notes about this workshop with \"LYT\". So a note named \"LYT - Unit 1\" will remain next to a note called \"LYT - Unit 2\".\n    - (Yes, this is also an example of¬†_Topical_¬†proximity.)\n\n**_Can you see how alphabetical proximity can be both unreliable and reliable?_**  \n  \n### Chronological proximity\nBesides the alphabet, the next most common way to sort notes is by¬†**_time_**. Time is often an effective way to leverage proximity because we often lean on our ability to recall things through our temporal context, i.e., we'll think, \"It happened around the same time as...\"\n\n- **Using¬†_created by_¬†dates for proximity**\n    - When you sort by¬†_creation date_, the proximities between your notes won‚Äôt change (in theory, but in practice they can change, so we can't completely trust what our file systems tell us.)\n- **Using¬†_modified by_¬†dates for proximity**\n    - One of the best uses of this is looking at \"recently modified\". This is good for an active working session as well as for recalling work you've done in the short-term and mid-term past.\n\n### Topical proximity\nTopical proximity is the most intentional. It is how we can walk in the shoes of the Ancients and use¬†**_spatial context_**¬†to construct meaning. The Ancients used \"mind palaces\" but we can use MOC notes. Well, MOCs are the best way, but we actually can use three types of topical proximity:\n- Filenames\n- Folders\n- MOCs\n\n- **Using prepended filenames for topical proximity**\n    - When you have multiple notes that you know you always want grouped together you can \"bake\" topical proximity into the filename by¬†**_prepending_**. When might you want to use it? Maybe for a book or a workshop/course like this one:\n        - LYT - Unit 1\n        - LYT - Unit 2\n        - LYT - Unit 3\n- **Using folders for topical proximity**\n    - Notes in the same folder will have a closer relationship since they are grouped in the same vicinity.¬†\n- **Using MOCs for topical proximity**\n    - Notes in the same MOC are very likely to be closely related, especially after you manually sort them into some form of relational positioning.¬†\n    - This is the ==best way to apply the power of proximity.==\n  \n**_Using just a single note‚Äîan MOC‚Äîyou can identify and build relationships between notes._**","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.739605357Z","tags":null},"/Sources/LYT/1c6-Building-relationships-with-MOCs":{"title":"1c6 - Building relationships with MOCs","content":"An MOC is just a note ‚Äî a very special type of note.¬†  \n  \nIt has properties of folders and tags, while effectively leveraging proximity.\n- **Folder-like:** MOCs assemble notes in a tightly-packed grouping.\n- **Tag-like:** MOCs group the links of associated notes in a non-exclusive way. (The notes themselves live freely elsewhere.)\n- **Proximity:** MOCs grant you the ability to deliberately position each note in relation to the other notes.\n\n\u003e In this way, MOCs don‚Äôt limit access, they¬†**curate**¬†it ‚Äî while keeping your notes free.\n\n## Analogies for MOCs\n- Using MOCs is like ==having your own warehouse full of workbenches==, where each workbench contains a selection of highly curated index cards for you to engage with.\n- In an MOC, the party is always happening.

Let's explore that method first...\n\n---\n_This first lesson will make the argument that spending time practicing the most common thinking methods actually creates little value. Even worse, it produces harmful side effects and takes away time that could be spent in far better ways._\n\n## The Compound Effects of Note-Taking\n- Rereading, highlighting, underlining...Sound familiar?¬†  \n  - Since a young age, we have been trained to study this way. Naturally, our study habits have become our learning habits; and our learning habits have become our thinking habits.¬†  \n  - But finally, science is exposing what many of us felt on some unconscious level: there has to be a better way!  \n  - Research is showing that rereading, highlighting, and underlining is only a quick fix. It's a Faustian Bargain: ==in the short-term we can successfully regurgitate answers and we can pass the test; but in the long-term we lose the chance to build lasting value as that knowledge slips away from our grasp.==\n\n### What does the research say?\n\u003e On your first reading of something, you extract a lot of understanding. But when you do the second reading, you read with a sense of ‚ÄúI know this, I know this.‚Äù‚Ä¶and it‚Äôs insidious, because this gives you the illusion that you know the material very well, when in fact there are gaps. ‚Äî *Mark McDaniel, co-author of Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning¬π*\n\n- This is further backed by a 2012 study that showed ==familiarity and recall are processed in two different parts of the brain==.¬≤  \n- That‚Äôs how rereading, highlighting, and underlining create the illusion of progress: ==We mistake¬†**_familiarity_**¬†with a concept with¬†**_ability_**¬†to actually work with it.== And there is an ocean of difference between the two.  \n- Rereading and re-highlighting are ==only worth doing when the material is dense and you need to reread just to understand it.==\n\n\u003e It may help‚Ä¶when texts are difficult, but it may actually hurt performance on higher-level tasks that require inference making.\n\n- ==Inference making basically means sensemaking.== That means these multi-step highlighting techniques actually get in the way of making leaps of insight.  \n- So¬†_multi-step highlighting techniques_¬†don't just waste time; and they don't just create a false sense of confidence in the material; they actually get in the way of sensemaking. (Now that's when I get angry!)\n- And yet, multi-step note-taking techniques have been brought into the digital world. ==These techniques are the digital continuation of the poor study habits we were indoctrinated into as kids by the \"industrial education system\".== #education\n- How can you identify these misguided techniques?¬†\n\t1. They encourage capturing large amounts of information, even if you never \"process\" the majority of it.\n\t2. They encourage multiple steps of basic note-taking:¬†_bolding, highlighting, highlighting the highlights, and then‚Äîmaybe eventually (which really means: never)‚Äîtaking those highlights and regurgitating them into a lifeless output._\n- In the digital world,¬†_multi-step highlighting techniques_¬†hasten the development of the following dangerous habits:\n\t1. Over-collecting\n\t2. Under-thinking by over-highlighting\n\t3. Reduced quality thinking and unique output\n- Over time your PKM system will become a digital library dominated with piles of barely summarized articles and snippets. In other words, all the \"noise\" drowns the \"signal\".  \n- Many of us want to build a \"second brain\" that becomes a joyful conversation partner, but¬†_after several years of these habits, you may find you don‚Äôt like the digital library staring back at you._\n\t- It'll look less like Richard Feynman and more like Frankenstein's Monster.\n---\n## Multi-step techniquesÔªø\n### Over-collecting\n- _Multi-step highlighting techniques_¬†encourage the habit of ==‚Äúcollecting without processing‚Äù.== In practice, this means saving many articles, while fully processing few.  \n- It‚Äôs said that this is a benefit so you don‚Äôt waste time over-processing less valuable information‚Äîbut why capture it in the first place?  \n- Just like you shouldn‚Äôt allow exploitative TV shows into your media diet, you shouldn‚Äôt allow low-quality content into your PKM diet. A little filtering at the start on your part is¬†_a dead simple solution_¬†to the problem.  \n- Let's dive a little deeper into this...  \n\t- _Multi-step highlighting techniques_¬†are actually much more insidious in the digital world because they quickly train people to habitualize a reckless form of over-collecting.  \n\t- Capturing something with the click of a mouse gives us the illusion that we are effectively \"managing knowledge\", but the truth is ==we are just trying to manage our own Knowledge FOMO (\"Fear Of Missing Out\").== So we impulsively feel compelled to \"panic-save\" yet another article.  \n- What these techniques are¬†_really_¬†trying to solve is the problem that comes from having a fearful relationship with Knowledge.¬†  \n- The simple solution is to ==not save so much \"noise\" in the first place!== But before we can recognize the \"noise\", but have to recognize the problem.  \n\u003e It's not about how to drink from the firehose 1% better; it's about putting the damn hose down, taking a breath, and developing a healthy relationship to Knowledge.\n- That's why we spend so much time thinking about the question: \"What is my relationship to Knowledge?\" because then ==we can have a clearer understanding of what is \"signal\" and what is \"noise\".  ==\n\t- A healthy relationship to Knowledge is not based on fear. It's based on your ==intrinsic motivations== and having a ==dialogue with the ideas you encounter.==  \n- When we start to do that, we start building better knowledge management habits and spending more time in \"The Land of the Note Makers\".  \n- But before we get there in the next lesson, let's continue to look at the corrosive long-term effects of¬†_multi-step highlighting techniques_¬†used by chronic Note Takers.\n\n### Under-thinking by over-summarizing\n- In terms of improving your memory or thinking ability¬†[bolding and highlighting creates a false sense of learning¬≥](https://pcl.sitehost.iu.edu/rgoldsto/courses/cogscilearning/dunloskiimprovingstudentlearning.pdf)\n- So if you want to improve your memory and recall, or if you want to think better‚Äî_multi-step highlighting techniques_¬†won't help much.\n\t- Staying in \"Highlighting Mode\" takes time away from more \"generative\" ways of thinking (see the next lesson).\n\t- Staying in \"Highlighting Mode\" prevents us from developing our own nuanced perspective to the ideas we are encountering.¬†\n\t- Staying in \"Highlighting Mode\" reduces our ability to think laterally‚Äîconnecting new ideas with other ideas we‚Äôve already encountered.\n\t- Staying in \"Highlighting Mode\" limits the amount of personally meaningful¬†**value**¬†we are creating.\n- Let's look more closely at how this impacts the quality and uniqueness of our thoughts.  \n\n#### Reduced quality thinking and unique output  \n- Some multi-step note-taking techniques‚Äîboth digital and analog‚Äîsuggest variations on the following steps: read and underline, then reread and highlight, then highlight the highlights, and then finally (if you're diligent), rewrite the highlights.\n- This is just repeating low-value note-_taking_. It's not note-_making_.  \n- It doesn‚Äôt encourage fresh, insightful thinking. Sure, you will be¬†_familiar_¬†with the material, but you won't be¬†_effective_¬†at applying it.  \n- This process‚Äîeven if you skip some of the steps‚Äîvastly reduces the actual time you devote to your best thinking.¬†  \n- The less time you spend in engaged, connective thinking = ==the fewer unique perspectives you have to offer others (and yourself).==\n\n\u003e _Your best thinking is when you are engaged in the material you encounter, relating it to other things, and finding your unique perspective amongst it all._\n\n#### Considering time value\n- Of course, there is value to highlighting things; we do it all the time, every day, in many ways. Something grabs our attention and we \"highlight\" it. It's foundational to how we make sense of the world. Please continue these¬†_normal_¬†ways of highlighting.  \n- But then there are¬†_multi-step highlighting techniques_¬†that are so focused on bolding and highlight, they seem to forget about ever getting on with the thinking part!  \n- Sure, there is¬†_some_¬†value to rereading and re-highlighting‚Äîbut please keep these questions handy:\n\u003e Instead of re-highlighting this material, why not start developing something with it?  \n\u003e Instead of¬†_deferring_¬†my best thinking, why not start¬†_doing_¬†my best thinking?\n\n- Since these multi-step note-_taking_¬†techniques require such low levels of engagement, ==the returns on your investment of time are also exceedingly low.  ==\n- Spending too much time note-taking is kneecapping your best thinking and harming the long-term health of your digital library.  \n- This is because it's taking time away from note-making. And note-making is where the most value is created...

Formally, we might call this ==\"Progressive Ideation\"==, but in the day-to-day, I prefer just saying ==\"note-making\".==\n\n\u003e **Progressive Ideation**¬†is the process of¬†_relating and developing ideas over time_. Through this process, your thinking efforts naturally compound.\n\nIf practiced, \"Progressive Ideation\" will develop the habits of:\n1. engaged thinking (this leads to more \"flow\")\n2. sensemaking (relating ideas and making leaps of insights)\n3. creative expression\n\n## ÔªøWhat does **Progressive Ideation** look like in practice?\nIt's some version of the following:\n1. Create new ideas (or highlight (once!), comment on, or extract ideas)\n2. Connect ideas\n3. Develop ideas\n4. Create with those ideas (as needed)\n\nThis is a way to spend time in a high-value activity that ==encourages your own independent, connective thinking==‚Äîand grows with you deep into the future.\n\nVery quickly in the process, you move from note-taking to note-making‚Äî==working with ideas in your own words.== You are not wasting time ‚Äúhighlighting the highlights‚Äù. You are more engaged with the material, but the engagement feels natural because ==you are having a conversation with the ideas you encounter.== It‚Äôs like you‚Äôre sitting down with the author of those ideas. You‚Äôre ready to chime in and say, ‚ÄúThat reminds me of SUCH AND SUCH‚Äù. (Hmm...that's a good prompt ;) )\n\n- Now you can just continue to connect your new notes to existing notes ‚Äî and develop both in a dialectic.\n- You can't help but ask powerful questions, ‚ÄúWhat does this relate to?‚Äù, ‚ÄúHow does this relate?‚Äù And you start making wild connections. And guess what:¬†_you create VALUE from finding the fascinating intersections of ideas that transcend genre_.\n- From these¬†**‚ÄúThought Collisions‚Äù**¬†in your dynamically growing digital library, you naturally start to create stuff. An article. A product. A business. Or simply a well-connected, super dependable, digital conversation partner. One that knows all the same jokes you do! One that often says, ‚ÄúHey, remember when‚Ä¶‚Äù\n    - ¬†Even if you don't care to create THINGS, you can't help but take your insights into each conversation you have with friends, family, and co-workers‚Äîenriching the experience for all.\n\nAnd at every point along the way you are an active, engaged, and independent thinker.  \n  \nCompare that to those¬†_multi-step highlighting techniques_, which defer your best thinking for a mythical \"someday later\" so you can consume more content at a surface level. ==You end up spending more time copying other people‚Äôs thoughts rather than developing your own.==  \n  \nThe same amount of time spent collecting, reading, collecting, bolding, collecting, highlighting, and even more collecting endless streams of articles could instead be spent¬†_collecting less stuff, but developing more value from the stuff you do collect ‚Äî_¬†like ==extracting insights, writing in your own words, and building deepening relationships in your digital note collection.==  \n  \nYou tell me which process sounds more engaging, more joyful‚Äîand ultimately, more valuable.\n\n## Progressive Ideation creates real value\n- When you read something important to you, ==what if you added comments as you went?== (Nothing major, just some comments like you were having an engaging conversation with a friend. For example, ‚ÄúHmm, this relates to BLANK‚Äù.)\n- What if you ==converted some of that information into a couple new notes==, each representing a core idea, each written in your own words?\n- What if you then ==linked these new ideas to other existing ideas in your note library==?\n\nWouldn‚Äôt that be nice? What if you did this 1000 times? How valuable would your digital bank of ideas be then? Why, you would have an amazing, organic, dynamic digital library of your accumulated knowledge, intuitively connected through ideas.\n\nA house would become a city. [This is an imaginative example of how accumulated knowledge can grow into something profound.](https://twitter.com/lukedubert/status/1278407035944669184/photo/1)\n\nLet's compare the value you're creating:  \n  \n_Multi-step highlighting techniques (chronic note-taking)_¬†is a ==low-value activity that encourages the bad habits of over-collecting, over-summarizing, and under-thinking. ==It‚Äôs a short-term means to an end.  \n  \nMeanwhile, Progressive Ideation is a high-value activity. It‚Äôs inherently valuable, meaning it's valuable for its own sake. But it‚Äôs not just inherently valuable. You are creating real value. Your thoughts have more value because you‚Äôve related so many different, diverse things to each other. ==You are exercising the muscles that make you an independent thinker (and communicator).== You have more to offer in any conversation you enter. ==You are building a potent network of reusable ideas.==\n\n\u003e You are no longer a regurgitation machine. You are a generation machine.\n\nProgressive Ideation says:¬†  \n\u003e _Be active. Engage in a conversation with the author. Put ideas into your own words early in the process so you can start developing your take on them while you link them to other ideas. Do that and you will have great joy as your ideas naturally compound in value over time._\n\n## Progressive ideation builds an evolving, dynamic digital library\n\u003eNotes aren‚Äôt just static records of our thinking. Rather, we think with our notes.  \n‚âà Richard Feynman\n\nOnce you start ==‚Äúthinking in ideas‚Äù== the world becomes a fascinating place. Every situation you encounter is ripe for spotting new ideas to add to your insanely dynamic digital library. Now get this: ==you might encounter the same texture of an idea in a completely different context. == \n  \nI know that last sentence doesn‚Äôt seem like a game-changer, but I promise you, it is. ==You‚Äôll be in a position to naturally make leaps of insights between unrelated concepts across domains.== A simple example is how concepts in Math rhyme with ideas in Music. Let‚Äôs explore an actual example below.\n\n- Imagine coming across the the idea of ‚ÄúMirror Neurons.‚Äù You think: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a cool concept.‚Äù\n- Basically, it‚Äôs the idea that when someone smiles or laughs, you‚Äôre more likely to smile or laugh as well. Or if you personified the idea, ‚ÄúWhen I dip you dip we dip‚Äù. So you make a new note called ‚ÄúMirror Neurons‚Äù‚Ä¶\n\t- ![[Extras/Media/Images/Mirror Neurons Note.png]]\n- Simultaneously, naturally, organically, you‚Äôre thinking:¬†_‚ÄúWhat does this relate to?‚Äù... ‚ÄúAh yes‚Äù_, you say, then you connect it to a similar concept, ‚ÄúLike begets like‚Äù.\n\t- ![[Extras/Media/Images/Like begets like Note.png]]\n- And here‚Äôs the graph view of the connections in and out of ‚ÄúLike begets like‚Äù.\n\t- ![[Extras/Media/Images/Like begets like Graph.png]]\n- But then you hear that Mirror Neurons are actually a debatable phenomenon currently. Here‚Äôs why Progressive Ideation is so valuable: ==You don‚Äôt delete the note, you just add the counter-example to the note.== You might branch off into a new note about the ‚ÄúProblems of Replication in Research‚Äù. And just like that, your note library has grown in value.\n\t- ![[Extras/Media/Images/Problems of Implication in Research Note.png]]\n- I mean, how cool is that?! Not only does this system allow for excellent output of products, articles and other creations; it also just makes every moment more enjoyable for you and for others. Suddenly it‚Äôs easier to stay engaged in conversations. Suddenly, you‚Äôre making valuable leaps of insights in those same conversations. That‚Äôs more value.\n\nThese ‚Äúevergreen‚Äù notes are the building blocks of original thought. And they are anti-fragile: ==they actually grow in value as they encounter new stressors!== See [[Antifragility]])\n  \n_Multi-step highlighting techniques (chronic note-taking)_¬†does not allow for anywhere near the same level of engaged, connective thinking that this simple example of Progressive Ideation creates. Now do this for a few years. The difference in compounded value is night and day.\n\n## Progression Ideation compounds in value over time\nProgressive Ideation gives you a massive advantage that only grows stronger as time goes on.  \n  \nIt focuses on ==merging ideas, concepts, and thoughts of other people into our own words and linking these new ideas into the web of knowledge we‚Äôve already developed.== THIS is how our knowledge grows! This is how we learn and improve. This is how you¬†_should_¬†go about building your digital companion.  \n  \nThis solution isn't completely new. It's basically the ==zettelkasten method== which converts the author‚Äôs words into your words much earlier in the process and then assimilates whatever you extracted into your growing body of knowledge (via links).  \n  \nIn this way, ==you spend more time developing your thoughts (compounding value), as opposed to progressively curating other people‚Äôs thoughts.==  \n  \nIf¬†_chronic note-taking techniques_¬†add $1 to your personal GDP, Progressive Ideation adds $10 of value¬†_which then continues to compound over time_. Your digital library grows in value as you naturally add more ideas, examples, and connections within it. So without much effort, you are dynamically evolving and building the complexity and relationships of your accumulated collection of ideas over time. Learn something new. Add it to the library. Connect it to existing knowledge.  \n  \n_Q: But what if the new stuff I add contradicts the old stuff?  \nA: Even better! You just link the new stuff with the old stuff and add your commentary. Now you have a high-level argument built into the note. This means: your digital library grows stronger from the randomness of life._\n\n## We need you\nWhether you are a ‚Äúknowledge worker‚Äù, an entrepreneur, a¬† manager, a creative professional, or just someone who likes to think‚Ä¶ We need you.  \n\n\u003e We need you to be your best self.¬†**We need you to share your unique perspective and ideas with the rest of us.**\n\nI hope you can now clearly see how an over-reliance on¬†_multi-step highlighting techniques_¬†dangerously relegates your best thinking to the end of a process that you often won‚Äôt ever get to.  \n  \nWhereas Progressive Ideation keeps you active and engaged throughout the process‚Äîencouraging better, more valuable contributions to the world that surrounds you.  \n\n---\n\nA healthy world needs citizens who think, who question, who develop thoughts and ideas over time and build bridges across different domains.  \n\nImaginative, connective‚Äîand at times, grounded‚Äîthinkers.  \n\nWe need citizens capable of actively thinking for themselves‚Äîbecause through that process‚Äî==they will be able to provide a better experience to those within their orbit.==  \n  \n\u003e We need you to spend the majority of your thinking time developing¬†_your_¬†thoughts and¬†_your_¬†nuanced perspective to the ideas you encounter.\n\nBecause ==a better you makes us all better.==","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.739605357Z","tags":null},"/Sources/LYT/2b1-The-3-paradigms-of-notes":{"title":"2b1 - The 3 paradigms of notes","content":"- What is a note? How do notes work? What can you do with notes?  \n- The answers can be understood through three paradigms. Each paradigm can break our preconceptions and unlock a deeper understanding around how we work with notes.\n\n## The three paradigms of notes\n- üçØ¬†**Notes are containers of thought**¬†üí≠\n    - ¬†You can put anything inside‚Äîa journal, a grocery list, an idea...anything.\n- üó£¬†**Notes allow conversations across time**¬†‚åõÔ∏è\n    - ¬† Notes allow your old self to send messages to your future self.\n- üå±¬†**Notes can change**¬†üå≤\n    - ¬† Notes don't have to be permanently written in concrete.

If you have too many zombie notes, your system gets overrun.\n\n---\n## What are **zombie notes**?\n- The most common zombie notes are ==web-clipped articles== (which is why Evernote encourages the growth of undead PKM systems so well), but they can arise in other ways. ==Ancient task lists== and ==long walls of text== from other people are ripe to become zombie notes.\n- You won't notice it at first.  But over time, the zombie notes will grow in numbers. They will grow in strength. Eventually, they will cause¬†[so much chaos](https://media2.giphy.com/media/VwHZ2F2e99hde/200.gif), you won't be able to ever focus on what matters.  \n- Some scholars suggest it is best to maintain a ratio of less than 1 zombie note for every 10 living notes. \n- How can you identify zombie notes?\n\t- \"**Zombie notes**¬†are unlinked, unloved, and ever-lingering.\"\n\t- Zombie notes are static notes.\n\t- Compare that to living notes...\n\n## What are **living notes**?\n- **Living notes**¬†are linked, loved, and ever-evolving.\n- Notes can change and evolve. Notes can be non-static. Notes can mature. Notes can make new friends, and lose their connection to old friends. Not all notes need to go on living. Some notes get deleted.¬†\n\t- Living notes can continue to mature.\n\t- Living notes maintain much of their value.\n\t- Living notes are what make up a dynamic collection of digital notes.¬†\n\t- Living notes are part of an emerging system of ideas (see \"[[Cards/Idea Emergence|Idea Emergence]]\").\n- Living notes are like paintings by Bob Ross.  He would paint beautiful mountains in the distance. Then, he would cover up half the mountains with splotches of dark green. But five minutes later, those splotches of dark green would become evergreen. \n- Living notes are the same way.¬†\n\t- Over the days, weeks, months, years, and decades, you will might return to your notes and throw in some new splotches.\n\t- You can then curate those splotches into \"happy little accidents\" that become more meaningful versions of themselves.¬†\n\t    - This is exactly what we are going to do in the next section on note-making.\n---\n## Grey Matter\n- \"Zombie notes\" aren't something we can perfectly quantify (like the term \"thought collisions\"). In Western culture, we try to reduce everything to its component parts, but squeezing too hard just ensures the water escapes our grasp. Too much yang. Needs more yin. ==By cupping the concept like we might cup water in our hands, we can better grasp the meaning.¬†==  \n- Simply put, you will be able to ==sense your zombie notes== because they add noise and stress to your PKM system. If that isn't enough, then ask: \"Is it linked? Do I love it?\" A double \"no\" likely means a double tap (right-click, delete).\n\n\u003e **Not all unlinked notes are unloved.** If you open the graph view, you will see lonely \"orphan\" notes. They may just need a home. Using the graph like this is a good way to give orphans a home, before they have a chance to become zombies.","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.739605357Z","tags":null},"/Sources/LYT/2b2-Evergreen-notes":{"title":"2b2 - Evergreen notes","content":"- Note-takers \"churn and burn\" through their notes. \n\t- They take them for a specific short-term (\"just-in-time\") purpose‚Äîlike a test or a project. \n\t- When the milestone concludes, the notes lose their value. \n\t- This type of note-taking doesn't accumulate long-term value.  \n- Note-makers \"know and grow\" with their knowledge. \n\t- Instead of having value evaporate from their short-term notes, note-makers create¬†**living notes**¬†that are able to grow in value and evolve over time.  \n¬†  \nLet's overly simplify this difference with a table:\n| Note-taking                      | Note-making                     |\n| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- |\n| Passive thinking                | Active thinking                  |\n| \"Churn and burn\"              | \"Know and grow\"             |\n| Static \u0026 permanent notes | Living \u0026 evergreen notes |\n\n\n- In the late 1950s, Niklas Luhmann didn't have a computer.

Decades later, Luhmann had ‚âà100,000 index cards that he used to write 400 articles and 60 books.¬†  \n- People are rightfully impressed by how prolific he was with his \"Zettelkasten\" method.

Here are a few things we can call higher-order notes:\n\t- **Link note**¬†- A note with a bunch of links.\n\t- **Hub note**¬†- A navigational note, like an airport hub (a Luhmann term).\n\t- **Index note**¬†- A note that references other notes (sometimes alphabetical, usually fairly static).\n\t- **Workbench**¬†- A brainstorming note with links and ideas usually quickly assembled.\n\t- **Outline note**¬†- A note for the early-stage outlining of content.\n\t- **Structure note**¬†- A term that describes what it does: structures stuff.\n\t- **Structure zettel**¬†- A term from `[zettelkasten.de](https://zettelkasten.de/)` - Usually shown as a linear table of contents, often with annotations.\n\t- **TOC (Table of Contents)**¬†- A static, finalized structure that references material.\n\t- MOCs\n\n## Defining MOCs\n- **MOCs (Maps of Content)**¬† are flexible higher-order notes that serve countless purposes.\n\t- MOCs can be used to gather, outline, structure, and navigate thought.¬†\n\t- MOCs can structure links to notes in countless ways.\n\t- MOCs can include a mixture of links, tags, queries, embeds, and anything you can think of.\n\t- MOCs can be used as¬†_active thinking tools_¬†that encourage the reshaping, connecting, and building of ideas.\n\t\t- That last bullet is perhaps the most valuable of them all:¬†**_MOCs can concentrate and accelerate thought collisions._**\n\n\u003e In a nutshell:¬†_MOCs helps you manage ideas by gathering, developing, and navigating them._\n\n- As the map-maker‚Äîthe cartographer‚Äîyou get to decide what makes it on the map.  \n- Then you get to develop those ideas.  \n- And all the while, you can use the MOC to navigate your ideas‚Äîboth now and into the future.\n\n---\nI call higher-order notes \"MOCs\" because they pass three important thresholds.\n- **The definition is clear**\n    - ¬†It stands for a \"Map of Content\". It is mapping the contents of some of your notes. The term \"map\" is a familiar term that we understand. The connotations and imagery associated with \"maps\" are also helpful.\n- **The definition is not too clear**\n    - MOCs have¬†_linguistic wiggle room_. This is a surprising power.\n    - Because an MOC note can be used in countless ways, any word that describes it requires an equally flexible definition. Preexisting words with preexisting definitions are too narrow in scope to define the breadth of what an MOC can do.\n- **The acronym serves practical purposes**\n    - It is easy to append to the filename. I.e., like `Habits MOC`.\n    - It is a visually clear representation of the note at a glance.\n    - It is a fairly unique search term.\n    - It doesn't use any non-standard characters that can get your filenames in trouble.\n    - It is easy to reference in conversations so everyone is quickly on the same page.","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.743605337Z","tags":null},"/Sources/LYT/3a5-The-three-phases-of-MOCs":{"title":"3a5 - The three phases of MOCs","content":"Maps of Content (MOCs) are one of the ultimate thinking tools.

I don't belong in this valley, in this river, This low, dark ocean with all these drops of water.\" Yeah?. ¬†And you feel confused. Then one day it gets hot And you slowly evaporate in the air. Way up... higher than any mountaintop, All the way to the heavens. Then you understand that it was at your lowest that you were closest to God. Because life's a journey that goes around and around And the end is closest to the beginning. So it's change you need, Relish the journey. Be a drop of running water.  \n\tObey those invisible pulls on your soul... Gravity, evaporation, love, Creativity. It's... in the darkest moments Is when the cracks allow The inner light to come out. But the spotlights... Don't let you see the inner light.\n\n- Mountain Top Water Drop reminds me of...philosophy?

It is far too easy to be an over-collector, so your low score suggests you are able to avoid most of the pitfalls around collecting too much information. Just make sure you don't totally close yourself off from diverse and competing viewpoints.\n\t- Ideation Index: 42\n\t\t- A high score in the Ideation Index suggests that, for you, thinking is inherently joyful‚Äînot just a means to an end. Prioritizing ideas and thinking makes it easier to maintain a healthy and sustainable relationship to Knowledge. Just be careful of getting so lost in your castle of thoughts in the sky that you become fragile in the physical world.\n\t- Churn Index: -8\n\t\t- You are not at risk for skipping sense-making for the sake of money-making. But pay attention to your Production Index. If you score low there, you'll want to be aware of a potential pitfall. (Those results are next.)\n\t- Production Index: 0\n\t\t- Scoring in the middle of the Production Index suggests that you are naturally able to balance your desire to learn just for the sake of learning with your desire for achievements and progress.\n\t- Emergence Index: -32.55\n\t\t- You easily brainstorm and generate ideas. You have no problem with being spontaneous and are able to adjust quickly to new information. Like a fish in water, you swim in lateral thinking. However, without some order, you feel scatterbrained and often wonder, \"Where did I put my phone again?\"\n\t\t- Damn that hit hard\n- Thinking Style\n\t- ![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20230202085617.png]]\n\t- ![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20230202085636.png]]\n\t- If your bottom-up score is higher than your top-down score...\n\t\t- **‚ÄúDivergent Thinker‚Äù**¬†(Healthy tendency): You are comfortable without having a complete high-level picture. Instead, you are able to work with limited information and follow the trail of enthusiasm, clues, and connections. You generate a lot of thoughts. The question is, can your divergent thinking lead to emergent thinking? \n\t\t- **‚ÄúScattered Thinker‚Äù**¬†(Unhealthy tendency): When taken too far, your tendency for bottom-up thinking can lead to a chronic sense of anxiety around trying to find things‚Äîwhether it's car key or old notes. One tendency of unhealthy bottom-up thinking is to chronically collect new and exciting information...never to touch it again.\n- Thinking Drivers\n\t- ![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20230202085906.png]]\n\t- Memory-driven: below average\n\t- Idea-driven: above average\n\t\t- You have the desire to connect things, which suggests you naturally want to make sense of the world.

Right now, I'd say that the sensemaking workflows that resonate the most with  me is **The Daily Spark** (no Weekly Arc), since I do most of my note-taking in Daily Notes.

He believed that ==learning should be deeply personal and students should learn a broad range of subjects to allow them to participate in greater democracy==. This was in contrast to the administrative progressive who favored a more pragmatic view on educated: ==a vocational approach in order to train workers to fuel the economy.==\n\n\u003e In response to this, Dewey wrote 2 articles to address vocational education. Dewey argued that vocationalists like Snedden erred in two respects:; their vision of vocational education is too closely allied with the interests of industrialists to serve the greater public interest, and; it suggests an imprudent approach to educational reform, whereby no meaningful change is ever forthcoming. ==Vocationalism merely props up the status quo==, a disappointing state of industrial relations warranting the continued exploitation of workers by management.\n\n\u003e This line of thinking falls into Snedden's view of education and society: ==people are either consumers or producers==. In this model of education, ==education is a tool to increase their potential earnings and escape poverty==; the status quo is always upheld. When someone is educated, another uneducated person slots right into the role.\n\n\u003e On the contrary, Dewey's vision of democratic education serves more beyond increasing earning potential. He envisioned that ==with proper rich education experience, people will be better equipped to cure social ills== that need to be addressed including poverty and crime as well as health concerns.","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.743605337Z","tags":null},"/Sources/Monomythical-Newsletter":{"title":"Monomythical - Newsletter","content":"## Information\n- **Source:** [[Nadia Eghbal]]\n- **Tags:** #internet #creators \n- **Notes:** [[Miscellaneous Notes/Literature Notes/Monomythical - Literature Notes]]\n\n## Highlights\n### 24: Monasteries\n- ==Knowledge work== regards us from high upon Maslow's hierarchy over the crook of its bespectacled nose; it's easy to miss right now, in light of more pressing basic needs (food, income, where to live, daily mood).

This distinction is important. ==Data does not have to be processed, whereas information does.==\n-  The utility of data lies in ==our ability to react to it.== If we have either the ==intellectual or emotional capacity== to process it, only then does it becomes information.\n-  Whenever we point to ‚Äúinformation abundance,‚Äù what we are really saying is that we have ==‚Äúendless opportunities to react to data.‚Äù==\n-  This whole process of ==previously unknown facts eventually shaping one‚Äôs perspective== is what I call the information lifecycle.\n![[Extras/Media/Images/Information Lifecycle.png]]\n-  The first filter is ==awareness.== This is governed by ==curiosity.==\n\t-  There are ==shades== to curiousity, from its purest form to its most restrictive.\n-  Whatever passes through becomes data, but in order for that to be processed as information, it must pass through the ==filter of reactivity.==\n\t-  What allows one to adjust the filter of reactivity is the ==strength of their capabilities.== Data becomes information only when you have the cognitive capacity to interpret it as such.\n-  Interpreting information has less to do with curiosity, and more to do with ==diligence.== Curiosity was the force that brought me to the book, but diligence is what will make that book a useful source of [knowledge](https://moretothat.com/framework-for-knowledge/).\n-  Once that information is processed, we then have the option to incorporate it into our worldview, or discard it altogether. This is decided by the final bottleneck: ==the filter of identity.==\n\t-  Identity is the collection of beliefs, ideas, and truths you hold to position yourself within the world. No matter how independent you think you are, identity is ==always constructed in relationship to something else that exists alongside you.==\n\t-  Identities organize the familiar, but divide the unfamiliar. ==The more we love the idea of ‚Äúus,‚Äù the more we hate the idea of ‚Äúthem.‚Äù==\n-  The only way we could break away from this (balancing inclusivity and exclusivity) is to ==free ourselves from the notion of identity as much as possible.== Krishnamurti calls this [‚Äúfreedom from conditioning,‚Äù](https://amzn.to/3gskMDy) where we are able to ==let go of all the societal influences== that have shaped and categorized us into certain roles.\n-  The less we need to rely on our identities to make sense of information, ==the more we can learn about the world, and uncover our true place within it.==\n\t-  Without cultivating curiosity, the awareness filter remains closed to any facts in the first place.\n\t-  Without updating our capabilities, we can‚Äôt react to whatever data we discover.\n\t-  And without letting go of identity, no amount of information will ever shift our perspective.","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.743605337Z","tags":null},"/Sources/Neuroplasticity-How-to-Use-Your-Brain-Malleability-to-Improve-Your-Well-being":{"title":"Neuroplasticity - How to Use Your Brain Malleability to Improve Your Well-being","content":"## Information\n- **Source:** [Accelerate Learning Community](https://accelerate.uofuhealth.utah.edu/resilience/neuroplasticity-how-to-use-your-brain-s-malleability-to-improve-your-well-being)\n- **Tags:** #mentalhealth #psychology \n\n### Highlights\n#### What it is, and why it's important\n\u003e Neuroplasticity, or¬†**the capacity for our brain cells to change in response to our behavior**, can help us more thoughtfully engage in activities that will contribute to our well-being‚Äìno matter our age.\n\n\u003e We can influence our brain development in positive or negative directions. The more we engage and challenge our mind and body, the longer our brains function at a high level.\n\n#### How it works\n\u003e Neuroplastic change occurs at the chemical, structural and functional levels of the brain. These changes work in concert with one another.\n\n\u003e **Chemical change**¬†occurs in the initial stages of learning something new. Chemical change primarily influences short-term memory or short-term improvement in a motor skill.\n\n\u003e **Structural change**¬†occurs when neurons in the brain change their connections, altering your brains structure. This type of change requires more effort and time. It involves long-term memory and long-term improvement of a motor skill.\n\n\u003e **Functional change**¬†occurs when entire brain networks change. These brain networks, as they are used over and over again, become more excitable and more efficient when activated.\n\n\u003e ==The more the brain is exercised, the stronger and more connected it becomes.== The connections occur across the brain‚Äôs grey and white matter. Grey matter is neural tissue that includes regions of the brain involved in muscle control, sensory perception (e.g., seeing, hearing), memory, emotions, speech, decision-making and self-control. White matter connects grey matter regions together.\n\n#### How to get started\nNeuroplastic change requires five components:\n|       **Component**        |                                                                                     **How It Works**                                                                                     |                                                                                      **Try It Now**                                                                                      |\n|:--------------------------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|\n|  **Challenge \u0026 Novelty**   |                              The skill should be new-to-you and not too easy to learn. Novelty and challenge are essential components for cognitive change.                              |                                     Think of something you‚Äôve always wanted to try (e.g., learn a new language, mountain climbing, play the guitar).                                     |\n|       **Intention**        | The skill you are practicing must have some meaning, relevance, or importance to you. Neuroplastic change is associated with the feeling of being rewarded while engaging in a new task. | Think about¬†_why_¬†you want to learn this skill (e.g., I love traveling, I love being in the mountains, I love guitar music). Make sure it matters to you personally, then write it down. |\n|   **Specific Attention**   |                                           The skills we practice tend to improve. Focusing on exact tasks increases the likelihood of change.                                            |                                    Have a plan. Schedule time in your calendar to focus on this task. Consider setting a personal goal and incentive.                                    |\n| **Repetition \u0026 Intensity** |                                     One-and-done is not enough. Shorter bouts of intense repetition are usually needed to creating new connections.                                      |                                             Check in with yourself weekly. Have you been following your plan? If not, adjust and keep going.                                             |\n|          **Time**          |                                     Be patient with yourself. Neuroplastic change takes time in order for structural and functional change to occur.                                     |                                                      Plan for lapses ‚Äì it‚Äôs normal.

Good trends always focus on the shift in an underlying human behavior or belief. They don‚Äôt describe a sin- gle interesting story or a hot new product or industry. \n\t- LOCATION: Page 46\n- Trend spotting isn‚Äôt the same as identifying actual trends.

Lifters are positive, purposeful workers who simultaneously uplift their co-workers, customers, communities and their company.\n\t- LOCATION: Page 146\n- In the past, brands would limit themselves to ‚Äúsoft branding‚Äù of cause-related initiatives‚Äîpreferring to take a quiet role as an invisible supporter rather than taking a public stand. This was once the best way for a corpo- ration to support initiatives that aligned with its core values without feeling overtly promotional.\n\t- LOCATION: Page 148\n- Data Abundance\n\t- LOCATION: Page 152\n- The growing ubiquity of data and the myriad ways it can be collected raise big questions about how to make it truly useful, who owns the data, and who should stand to profit from it.\n\t- LOCATION: Page 153\n- In addition to all this data collected by organizations and information shared online by individuals, there is one other source of considerable data that is increasingly being made publicly available: ‚Äúopen data.‚Äù This term refers to the vast stores of data dumped online by companies and governments in the name of transparency or regulatory compliance.\n\t- LOCATION: Page 154\t\n- When it comes to data, quality is far more important than quantity\n\t- LOCATION: Page 158\n- A   story   in   the   Washington   Post   reported   that   teenagers   are   curating   their   accounts   on   Instagram   and   deleting old photos that either did not get many likes or no longer were wanted on their profiles. But when users delete old posts, that alters their page views and engagement time stats, skewing the data that Instagram is trying to monetize. The less accurate their data, the fewer opportunities there are to sell advertising. Desperate to stop users from deleting the data its business model depends on, Instagram introduced a feature that allows users to archive their old images instead of deleting them. As we continue to generate more data, there will be growing urgency to ensure the data is in good enough shape   to   be   usable.\n\t- LOCATION: Page 158\n- In other words, having access to a treasure trove of data collected by wearable devices doesn‚Äôt necessarily translate to health providers finding meaning in it. Even patients struggle to find real value in the data beyond ‚Äúfeel-good stats.‚Äù The devices provide plenty of pats on the back, for example, displaying celebratory firework icons every time the user reaches an arbitrary goal, such as walking 10,000 steps in a day. The result is plenty of data collection, yet potentially little impact on long-term health or happiness from it.\n\t- LOCATION: Page 164\n- Although we willingly trade our data, we remain concerned about how such details are used, a point I wrote about   back   in   2014   with   a   trend   we   called   Privacy   Paranoia .   Still,   the   reason   we   do   it   is   because   we   are   under   the influence   of   what   behavioral   economics   call   benefit   immediacy :   We   share   information   willingly   because   the benefits of doing so are immediate while the risks are delayed.\n\t- LOCATION: Page 169\n- Protective Tech\n\t- LOCATION: Page 173\n- As we increasingly rely on predictive technology that keeps us and our world safe and makes life more conve- nient, we must contend with the privacy trade-offs required to make it work.\n\t- LOCATION: Page 173\n- The tension between the desire for smart tech to help us manage our lives‚Äîin this case, our health‚Äîand our worry that it might infringe on privacy will only grow as this tech becomes more ubiquitous. It raises a natural question: Should we cede so many health and life decisions to machines?\n\t- LOCATION: Page 178\n- As   the   Protective   Tech   megatrend   plays   out   over   the   coming   decade,   a   generation   of   young   consumers   will   ex- pect technology to optimize every waking moment of their lives. But as they become dependent on technology to take care of the mundane tasks of adulting, will they also lose the ability to handle more nuanced parts of having human relationships and turn to technology for those as well?\n\t- LOCATION: Page 181\n- Predictive smart technology already makes our lives more convenient and safer. But in order to provide real- time utility, these technologies have to ‚Äúlisten,‚Äù collecting information about us and our environment 24/7. As protective tech becomes more sophisticated, it will lead to more debates about how much of our daily lives should be trackable and how important personal privacy and individual liberties are when weighed against the broader interests of society.\n\t- LOCATION: Page 182\n- As learning technology gets smarter, it‚Äôs evolution will largely come from watching humans and parsing the media that humans create‚Äîwhich leads to an unusual chal- lenge for humanity. Just as we must serve as role models for our children, increasingly we will need to serve that same role for our technology as well.\n\t- LOCATION: Page 183\n- Flux Commerce\n\t- LOCATION: Page 184\n- As the lines between industries erode, how we sell and buy anything changes constantly, leading to a con- tinual disruption of business models, distribution channels, consumer expectations and even innovation it- self.\n\t- LOCATION: Page 185\n- The enthusiasm around a ‚Äúfad‚Äù has always been intense and viral. But fad fatigue has had a tremendous ef- fect on how we buy (or not buy) products. We are simply moving on to the next flavor of the month faster and faster. This has put companies under tremendous pressure to find new ways to innovate. They are trying to find the ‚Äúnext big thing‚Äù and fear that nothing less than a complete overhaul of their business will be necessary to assure their relevance and survival. It has led some of the more desperate to naively look to recreate exactly what   they   see   more   innovative   competitors   doing‚Äîa   trend   we   described   as   Innovation   Envy   in   2019.\n\t- LOCATION: Page 191\n- Often, companies will mistake invention for innovation. They are not the same thing. This com- mon mistake can lead to shallow ideation, one-dimensional product or service ideas, and undif- ferentiated engagement with your customers. Look beyond products to consider new business models that integrate greater purpose and deliver more robust experiences that delight cus- tomers.\n\t- LOCATION: Page 191\n- Likeonomics Brands, products, and services succeed by being more human, mission driven, and personally likeable through their policies and people, gaining an advantage over less empathetic competitors.\n\t- LOCATION: Page 199\n- Culting of Retail The best retailers create passionate users who not only buy products, but also rave about their experiences.

Roblox Kids Learn Its Hard to Earn Money Making Games - Essay","content":"## Information\n- **Source:** [[Cecilia D' Anastasio]]\n- **Tags:** #metaverse #games #creators #business \n- **Notes:** \n\n## Highlights\n[How Roblox is Exploiting Young Game Developers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gXlauRB1EQ)\n\n\u003e ‚ÄúWith most of the games on the platform being made by minors and ==a revenue split that's just one third of the industry standard==, we looked into whether these young developers were in fact being exploited.‚Äù (Traditionally, game stores have taken a 30 percent cut of revenue that publishers earn on their platforms, and hand 70 percent over to the devs. _Roblox_ [gives developers](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/articles/developer-economics) just 25 percent, plus payouts based on engagement.)\n\n\u003e People Make Games‚Äô analysis of _Roblox_‚Äôs economics highlights the chasm between _Roblox_‚Äôs promise as a way for kids to become game developers and the reality: ==It is very challenging to make money on _Roblox_, and _Roblox_ profits from people trying.==\n\n\u003e _Roblox_ provides a lot for its developers: server space, marketplace infrastructure, cross-platform capability. Roblox Studio is, like the game, free. Developers can make money through _Roblox_ with its [Developer Exchange program](https://www.roblox.com/develop/developer-exchange), or DevEx, which gives developers 25 percent of a game‚Äôs earnings. (Part of _Roblox_‚Äôs [justification](https://venturebeat.com/2017/07/21/the-deanbeat-robloxs-kid-developers-make-enough-robucks-to-pay-for-college/) for this split is its huge investment in infrastructure for these devs.) _Roblox_‚Äôs VP of marketing [told](https://www.alistdaily.com/strategy/roblox-discovering-future-game-developers-entrepreneurs/) _AListDaily_ in 2018, ‚ÄúFrom the very beginning, it was about having kids develop games for other kids.‚Äù DevEx‚Äôs [terms](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005718246-Developer-Exchange-Terms-of-Use) require users to be 13 or over.\n\n\u003e It wasn‚Äôt easy. To withdraw money earned through microtransactions in a game, a developer must earn a ==minimum ==of 100,000 Robux, the platform‚Äôs in-game currency. Buying 100,000 Robux through _Roblox_‚Äôs store costs $1,000.= Selling 100,000 Robux back to _Roblox_ earns you just $350. ==Withdrawal is not even possible unless these developers pay a five-dollar monthly fee for a _Roblox_ Premium Subscription.== (_Second Life_ and _Entropia Universe_, which also allow players to sell items, respectively have $10 and $100 minimums for withdrawing money.)\n\n\u003e Smith believes ==this setup disincentivizes users from withdrawing Robux. They‚Äôre devalued off-platform, so why not spend them on other _Roblox_ games?== Smith compares _Roblox_‚Äôs currency to mining camps‚Äô company scrips, a now-illegal currency used by miners to purchase goods at company stores. Miners were encouraged to spend their money on their employers‚Äô goods because, elsewhere, the scrip was moot.\n\n\u003e A _Roblox_ spokesperson tells _WIRED_ that ==‚Äúbuilding experiences on Roblox teaches the fundamentals of coding, digital civility, and entrepreneurship and has helped many begin their careers in STEM.‚Äù ==_Roblox_ gave developers $129.7 million in the second quarter of 2021, and according to the spokesperson, over 600 developers earn over $85,000 a year from their _Roblox_ creations. The company also hosts programs and offers Developer Relations professionals to help developers succeed.","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.743605337Z","tags":null},"/Sources/One-Week-in-the-Future":{"title":"One Week in the Future","content":"## Information\n- **Source:** https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2206.00533\n- **Tags:** #AI #codesign #future \n- **Notes:** \n\n## Annotations\n\n\u003e%%\n\u003e```annotation-json\n\u003e{\"created\":\"2023-08-11T14:53:24.956Z\",\"text\":\"Problem: I don't think they analyzed pretty deeply...the sociotechnical implications of their visions\",\"updated\":\"2023-08-11T14:53:24.956Z\",\"document\":{\"title\":\"One Week in the Future: Previs Design Futuring for HCI ResearchOne Week in the Future: Previs Design Futuring for HCI Research\",\"link\":[{\"href\":\"urn:x-pdf:c5d701d5cd00c2b18cfa5abb3846fa9e\"},{\"href\":\"vault:/pdfs/One_Week_in_the_Future_Previs_Design_Futuring_for_HCI_Research_PRISM.pdf\"}],\"documentFingerprint\":\"c5d701d5cd00c2b18cfa5abb3846fa9e\"},\"uri\":\"vault:/pdfs/One_Week_in_the_Future_Previs_Design_Futuring_for_HCI_Research_PRISM.pdf\",\"target\":[{\"source\":\"vault:/pdfs/One_Week_in_the_Future_Previs_Design_Futuring_for_HCI_Research_PRISM.pdf\",\"selector\":[{\"type\":\"TextPositionSelector\",\"start\":42439,\"end\":43144},{\"type\":\"TextQuoteSelector\",\"exact\":\" To reflect upon and identify emergent themes across the sprints, each sprint‚Äôs participants firstproduced a document summarizing the process, reflections, and outcomes from their week.

At such times, the painful physical or emotional symptoms we experience can be interpreted as a wake-up call, as a kind of cry for help from our soul.\n- From this perspective, the soul might speak through a feeling of nagging anxiety, a knot in the stomach, a stubborn depression we can't seem to shake, boredom or burnout in our work, or a persistent inner sense of spiritual restlessness or emptiness in spite of apparent contentment on the surface of our life.\n- According to Abraham Maslow, when our deeper spiritual needs are ignored or neglected, we get sick.\n- Our first inclination may be to try to fix or cure the annoying or uncomfortable symptom, to rid ourselves of the thing that is disrupting the status quo of our life...From the perspective of the soul, however, this may be exactly the wrong approach, because it signals that we are unable or unwilling to hear what our soul may be trying to tell us through the symptom. ==If it is a cry for help from our soul, then the right thing to do is to pay attention. Instead of ignoring our own pain, we need to begin by compassionately listening to it, by allowing it to have a voice.==\n- ‚ÄúWe should not try to ‚Äòget rid‚Äô of a neurosis,‚Äù said Jung, ‚Äúbut rather to experience what it means, what it has to teach, what its purpose is. We should even learn to be thankful for it, otherwise we pass it by and miss the opportunity of getting to know ourselves as we really are.‚Äù In Jung's view, the neurotic symptom itself offers an opportunity or invitation to learn something about ourselves; it is a potential blessing in disguise.\n- ‚ÄúThe unconscious,‚Äù says Sanford, ‚Äúknows what we do not know and what we must learn about ourselves and life in order to become well.‚Äù\n- Appreciating the meanings and getting the messages of our symptoms can teach us what our soul needs, what it may be craving or longing for. Is there something missing in our life, some need that we are neglecting? Is there some unfinished emotional or spiritual business that requires taking care of? Is there something we must do, some action we are called to take, that can help us to recover our emotional or spiritual health?\n- Example: Or perhaps a woman's neurotic guilt and fear have always held her back by inhibiting her inclinations toward personal authenticity and individuation, with the result that she ends up feeling emotionally constricted and spiritually trapped by the circumstances she has chosen for herself. Her mounting desperation may signal the stirrings of a calling to overcome her fears by taking steps to liberate herself from her self-imposed bondage\n\t- Damn this hit me hard\n- If we are willing to learn, symptoms can teach us **humility**.\n- The spatial metaphor for where we are located emotionally or spiritually when we are sick or suffering is down. Spiritually, we find ourselves in the ‚Äúvalley of the shadow of death‚Äù or in the ‚Äúbelly of the whale.‚Äù Emotionally, we are brought low by depression or disappointment or emotional trouble. We are reminded of our weakness, our vulnerability, our lack of control‚Äîincluding control over emotional states that cannot be overcome by the power of our own will\n\t- Symptoms humiliate; they relativize the ego. They bring it down. Cure of symptoms may but restore the ego to its former ruling position. The humiliation of symptoms is one of the ways we grow humble‚Äîthe traditional mark of the soul\n- Such humbling and even humiliating experiences serve as a reality check for our ego. They remind us that we are not God, and they put us in touch with our need for a power greater than ourselves to heal and save us from whatever is ailing us.\n\n#### The Wounded Healer\n- wounded healer‚Äîthe person whose sufferings become a source of healing to others.\n\n#### Redemptive Suffering\n- One factor that determines whether suffering will have a redemptive outcome is our attitude toward it.\n- The ‚Äúright‚Äù attitude enables us to discern meaning in our sufferings. Meaning is what makes it possible for us to make spiritual sense of what otherwise seems senseless, to bear what would otherwise be unbearable.\n- When we are contending with painful life problems, finding the blessing has to do with discovering the hidden spiritual meaning or message contained in the problem, the ‚Äúblessing in disguise.‚Äù\n- one thing suffering seems to do quite effectively is to remind us of our need for God, for ‚Äúaccess‚Äù or connection to a higher power that can save or deliver us from misfortune or danger.\n- Access to the beloved makes possible a redemptive experience of shared suffering, a compassionate experience of ‚Äúsuffering with‚Äù in place of the crushing experience of suffering alone.\n- Authentic Christian spirituality is not about suffering for its own sake. It is about the redemptive breakthrough of love and compassion through suffering, or in the midst of it, or in spite of it.\n- In a mysterious way, the crucified Jesus not only provides us with a concrete image of God's love and compassion for suffering humanity but also evokes compassion in us for the God who suffers.\n- The image of Jesus can also serve as a point of compassionate connection with suffering humanity, with the God who is suffering right now in suffering persons and in the ‚Äúcrucified peoples‚Äù of the world.\n\n### Ideas\n- [[Narcissism]]: Narcissists don't want to grow because they're perfectionists ([[Cards/Perfectionism]])\n- Mature love as [[Cards/Maganimity]]\n- I need to find the meaning behnid my symptoms\n- 2 ways to respond to suffering: with bitterness or compassion ([[Cards/Brokenness]])\n- Suffering reminds me that I cannot floruish alone.

Day (2005) adds that this imbalance between global supply anddemand for access, ‚Äúmakes the imperative of providing a decent education for all one of thegreatest moral challenges of our age‚Äù (p. 186).\n\n\u003e In terms of its beneÓÇøts, the OECD and World Bank ( 2007) have notedthat transnational education provides ==additional capacity for countries (e.g., China) to meetthe demand for higher education.== Others can ==beneÓÇøt from foreign experience and knowledge== to improve the quality of their education system. Accordingly, it may also ==help to expand a higher education system== and to ==increase the country‚Äôs supply of highly skilled workers andacademics.== Inter-institutional partnerships may provide opportunities for organizational learning for local institutions relating to the quality and relevance of their services. The ad-dition of transnational programming also adds ==variety and choice== to domestic systems. Hope(2005) adds that transnational educational programs ==introduce competition and the potentialfor greater innovation== in the available educational programs. She also notes that the ==range,prestige and quality of domestic programs may be enhanced== through domestic/foreign part-nerships. Of course, when one considers the cost of relocation, accommodation and interna-tional fees associated with studying abroad, Hope has observed that there is often a ==cost savings== to the student associated with the delivery of transnational programs. Hope (2005)and others have also noted that transnational distance programs may ==reduce the magnitudeof ‚Äúbrain drain‚Äù== arising when domestic students travel abroad for desired programs. Brain drain may be reduced in two ways. First, given the capacity of elearning technologies totranscend vast distances provides opportunities for those who have migrated in student ex-change programs to ==keep in contact with their homelands and may participate in capacitybuilding== through teaching in elearning programs (Altbach et al., 2009). Second, and moreimportantly, given access to the global classroom, domestic graduates can ==remain at hometo contribute to the local knowledge economy. ==Moreover, given that approximately half ofthe world‚Äôs instructors hold no more than a bachelor‚Äôs degree, and most of those are in thedeveloping world, transnational partnerships ==may bring needed expertise and professionaldevelopment== to disadvantaged countries.\n\n\n\u003e However, as noted by the OECD and World Bank ( 2007), the global classroom is not a panacea. There have been concerns raised about the ==quality of foreign programs== and ==‚Äúrogue‚Äù or bogus providers== (Hope, 2005). Foreign provision may simply provide ==short-term, unsus-tainable imported capacity that vanishes when the domestic demand or resources run out.==The acquisition of foreign credentials may result in brain drain. ==The simple importation ofpre-packaged programs may lead to the comodiÓÇøcation of education== (Hope, 2005). It mayalso be ==irrelevant to local needs, or worse, culturally inappropriate and lead to a devaluationof local knowledge== (Lien, 2006) and ==cultural homogenization== (Askeland \u0026 Payne, 2007 ).==Patterns of domination== may be maintained, as Larsson, Boud, Dahlgren, Walters and Sork(2005) observed, by domestic institutions and students who demand that foreign providersoffer content identical to its home country. However, such a stipulation may lead to ==culturally irrelevant programming and the devaluation of local knowledge.== Hope (2005) has similarlynoted similar impacts arising from ==the use of English and standardized curriculum ratherthan national language and culturally appropriate curriculum.== Such programs, that are generally much more expensive than domestic programs, ==may worsen equity problems== if foreignprograms are only available to afÓÉÄuent families. Indeed, the cost of these programs may besimply out of the reach of many of the students in need of such programs and thus may nothave any noticeable impact in meeting the demand for higher education. There is also theconcern of ==widening the ‚Äúdigital divide‚Äù== (Allport, 2001; Hope, 2005) and ==domestic socialand economic disparities== (Colle \u0026 Roman, 2004). Similar concerns are observed for domesticeducational institutions that lack the resources of foreign providers and may be restricted bydomestic funding and regulatory regimes.\n\n+ [[Cards/Education lives within a system of domination and liberation]]\n+ [[Cards/Digital learning exacerbates and reproduces inequality]]\n\n\u003e ==The idea of universal knowledge, skills and values‚Ä¶is a prerequisite for a global mar-ket==‚Ä¶Relationships between developed, powerful countries and cultures and developing,powerless countries and cultures are like ==colonial relationships== in a new way.

For others thetrend represents an ==assault on national culture and autonomy.== It is undoubtedly both.(Altbach, Riesberg \u0026 Rumbley, 2009, p.ii-iii)\n\n\n\u003e For those who will be teaching in the global classroom, competency involves more thanacademic credentials and proÓÇøciency, as instructors also need to become more ==culturally, ifnot globally, competent.== Heffernan and Poole (2005) note global competency begins with ==self-awareness of one‚Äôs own cultural norms and expectations.== Additionally, others suggestthat the global teacher needs to approach the classroom with ==acceptance and curiosity==; thatis, having an open mind while seeking to understand cultural norms and expectations ofstudents (Hunter, White, \u0026 Godbey, 2006). In this way, the instructor‚Äôs awareness of themulticultural context will enable him or her to recognize cultural differences and multipleperspectives as assets rather than obstacles to teaching. Where appropriate, the instructormay also need to ==recognize and respond to differences between high and low context cultures==(Germain-Rutherford \u0026 Kerr, 2008) and ==adopt greater ÓÉÄexibility and use a variety of instruc-tional tools, methodologies and student/instructor roles== (Seufert, 2002).

Fast is busy, controlling, aggressive, hurried, analytical, stressed, superficial, impatient, active, quantity-over-quality. Slow is the opposite: calm, careful, receptive, still, intuitive, unhurried, patient, reflective, quality-over-quantity. It is about making real and meaningful connections with people ‚Äî culture, work, food, everything.‚Äù\n\n\u003e Unfortunately, our education system, at least in North America, has been deeply influenced by the ==‚Äúneed for speed‚Äù,== or what George Ritzer has termed ==‚ÄúMcDonaldization‚Äù== ‚Äî that is, ==‚Äúthe process by which the principles of the fast food industry are coming to dominate more and more sectors of the world.==\n\n\u003e Ritzer outlines four characteristics¬†of this mechanistic worldview: ==efficiency, predictability, calculability (quantifiable results) and control== ‚Äî or at least the illusion of control. In regards to education, McDonaldization attempts to wipe out any of the messiness or inefficiencies of learning. Instead, it attempts to reduce it to a ==commodity that can be packaged, marketed and sold.== Rather than¬†cultivating a deep, holistic love of learning that touches every aspect of a student‚Äôs life, ==learning has been reduced to an assembly line.== In reality, we‚Äôve imposed a mechanistic view of life onto how people learn, which is largely an organic process, and at a great cost.\n\n\u003e Education continues to ==rapidly adopt short-cuts== that reflect the dimensions of McDonaldization. Essentially, this imposition seeks the most efficient (read, easiest) way to get a student from kindergarten to grade 12 . ¬†In an assembly line, ==things are homogenized as much as possible.== In education we tend to see this in the assumption that the most important thing a group of kids have in common is the year they are born.\n\n\u003e Efficiency has also the birthed the idea that ==teachers can be replaced by Khan Academy==, and the ridiculous class sizes that many teachers now have to deal with. I don‚Äôt doubt that the Khan Academy can transmit information, but that‚Äôs assuming that the transition of information is the most important part of learning. Can it help to develop our children into thoughtful , ethical citizens, who critically evaluate, rather than being swayed by the flavour of the day? Does it create¬†citizens, instead of consumers? ==When learning is treated as one more product to be consumed, a horrible disconnect occurs in our students. It becomes about the mark. It becomes about the diploma. It becomes about the end justifying a lot of terrible means.==\n\n\u003e Predictability causes the ==standardization of a curriculum, and the way it‚Äôs taught, with little or no regard for student interest, background or ethnicity. ==Every student must be able to display the same skill (or regurgitation of content knowledge) at the same time. However, it‚Äôs important to be able to calculate if any of this is making a difference, so a system of high stakes testing is introduced.\n\n\u003e And of course, there must be a way to control those involved. ==Fear. Fear of losing one‚Äôs job. Fear of losing funding. Fear of embarrassing test results being published. Fear of one‚Äôs child not being able to get into college to get a ‚Äúgood‚Äù job.== There‚Äôs an awful lot of fear in education today, and the truth is, we have no idea what the long term cost of this is either. We know in the short term, we lose a lot of new teachers in the first five years. We know that others quit early or need stress leave. We know that children are more heavily medicated now more than any other time in history. So how do we change all of this insanity?\n\n\u003e The Slow Food movement ==abdicates the industrial food conglomerates==, and seeks to reconnect citizens to the richness of a common life with the neighbours who grow and prepare our food. The Slow movement¬†is a call for intentionality, an awareness of our mutual interdependence with all people and all creation. And it seeks to root people in their community.\n\n\u003e Slowness doesn‚Äôt require everything be done as slow as possible. Instead, it seeks to ==do things well \u0026 at the right speed.==\n\n\u003e So what does the Slow movement mean for education? It asks us to reimagine what it means to be a community of learners. ¬†It requires us to admit to, and evaluate the organic, messiness of learning. It requires admitting that a large part of what is happening isn‚Äôt good for our children, our teachers, or our communities. Rather than a top down industrialized and homogenized assembly line of education, we need a ==grass roots development of education that takes into account what real learning looks like and what children really need.==\n\n\u003e Instead we need a reimaging of what learning can be: ==Slow Education==. As Honore states, ‚ÄúWe are doing a great disservice to our children by pushing them so hard to learn things earlier and earlier and by keeping them so busy. They need time and space to slow down, to play, to be children. Across the world, parents, politicians, adults in general are so anxious about children nowadays that we have become too interventionist and too impatient; we don‚Äôt allow them enough freedom. ‚Äù\n\n\u003e The principles of the Slow Food movement are ==good, clean, and fair.== I imagine the principles of the Slow Education movement as ==authentic, individualized, and formative.==\n\n\u003e ==**Authentic** education== requires that learning not be based on worksheets, standardized tests, or the myriad of other terrible things we subject children to. Instead, it allows children of all ages to engage in real, meaningful work that matters to them and their community. Learning that gives them an authentic purpose and a role in society, other than consumer-in-training. It allows students to discover the everyday citizens in their community and how they are working to make it a better place. Furthermore, it empowers kids with the opportunity to identify and seek solutions to the problems in their community. As a consequence of these changes, it¬†seeks to re-educate our communities to see students as authentic, active participants in community life. Authentic education is also an act of justice. It‚Äôs about allowing kids the chance to explore social issues and helping them become ethical citizens who speak out and make a difference.\n\n\u003e ==**Individualized**.== Enough¬†homogeneity. Education must be responsive to the real needs of students. We need to shift to using content to teach skills, student interest and most importantly teaching kids how to learn. It needs to put the onus of learning on those who have the most at stake: students. It requires teachers to become co-learners, and let go of control. It requires districts to trust administrators, administrators to trust teachers, and teachers to trust students. It requires a great deal of conversation about what real learning is and why it matters. It allows kids to explore what matters to them, to build things that don‚Äôt work, and to figure out why. It requires them to form opinions and justify them based on solid evidence. And it requires adults who care and can speak carefully, and honestly into the lives of their students. Supporting all of this is a community that is deeply connected to the life of the school.\n\n\u003e Finally, all learning should be ==**formative**.== We talk a lot about formative and summative assessment. But I honestly wonder why¬†we even have summative assessments? Bottom line? To give a mark. To give the test score. So kids can have marks for college. Marks should be abolished. I realize that‚Äôs a strong statement, but I have good reasons for saying so. In addition to being an arbitrary symbol that we‚Äôve given an awful lot of power to, it means very little. What does 82 mean? Really. I‚Äôve asked students that question. I‚Äôve asked parents and other teachers, as well. No one really knows. Does it mean you don‚Äôt know 18% of the stuff? And which 18%. What if it‚Äôs the really important 18%?\n\n\u003e So what is the bottom-line of the slow education movement?\n‚úì We abolish the¬†busy, controlling, aggressive, hurried, analytical, stressed, superficial, impatient, quantity-over-quality education environment that prevails today.\n‚úì We educate parents and communities about the risks of today‚Äôs current model, including the drawbacks of ‚Äúedubusiness.‚Äù\n‚úì We create learning environments that are¬†carefully crafted, receptive, still, intuitive, unhurried, patient, reflective, quality-over-quantity and engaging.\n‚úì We develop curriculum that has greater depth than breadth.\n‚úì We make sure our curriculum takes into account local culture and celebrates the uniqueness of our local community.\n‚úì We don‚Äôt isolate skills development but let students grow their skills as they engage with important content.\n‚úì We construct learning environments that foster questioning, creativity and innovation, such as the maker movement and project/problem based learning.\n‚úì We find the courage to have serious discussions about abolishing standardized testing, classroom marks and grading, and the use of ‚Äúbirth year‚Äù as our primary criterion for sorting students.\n‚úì We lobby our governments for funds to assure true equality in education for all children.\n‚úì We discontinue the ranking of teachers and schools.\n‚úì We replace our egg-carton grades with flexible, personalized learning that takes into account when students are ready to engage in and acquire important skills.\n‚úì We make time for teacher collaboration a top priority.\n‚úì We expect all classrooms to connect students globally so they can learn from others around the world and apply what they learn in their own communities through meaningful projects and service.\n‚úì We make student voice and choice an integral part of everyday teaching and learning.\n","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.743605337Z","tags":null},"/Sources/The-Minecraft-Generation-Essay":{"title":"The Minecraft Generation - Essay","content":"## Information\n- **Source:** [[Clive Thompson]]\n- **Tags:** #games #education \n- **Notes:** \n\n## Highlights\n\u003e For one thing, it doesn‚Äôt really feel like a game. It‚Äôs more like a destination, a technical tool, a cultural scene, or all three put together: a place where kids engineer complex machines, shoot videos of their escapades that they post on YouTube, make art and set up servers, online versions of the game where they can hang out with friends. It‚Äôs a world of trial and error and constant discovery, stuffed with byzantine secrets, obscure text commands and hidden recipes. And it runs completely counter to most modern computing trends. ==Where companies like Apple and Microsoft and Google want our computers to be easy to manipulate ‚Äî designing point-and-click interfaces under the assumption that it‚Äôs best to conceal from the average user how the computer works ‚Äî Minecraft encourages kids to get under the hood, break things, fix them and turn mooshrooms into random-¬≠number generators. It invites them to tinker.==\n\n\u003e As Ian Bogost, a game designer and professor of media studies at Georgia Tech, puts it, ==Minecraft may well be this generation‚Äôs personal computer.==\n\n\u003e ‚ÄúChildren,‚Äù the social critic Walter Benjamin wrote in 1924, ‚Äúare particularly fond of ==haunting any site where things are being visibly worked on.== They are irresistibly drawn by the detritus generated by building, gardening, housework, tailoring or carpentry.‚Äù\n\n\u003e This is what computer scientists call ==computational thinking==, and it turns out to be one of Minecraft‚Äôs powerful, if subtle, effects. The game encourages kids to regard logic and if-then statements as fun things to mess around with. It teaches them what computer coders know and wrestle with every day, which is that programs rarely function at first: The work isn‚Äôt so much in writing a piece of software but in debugging it, figuring out what you did wrong and coming up with a fix.\n\n\u003e Minecraft is thus an ==almost perfect game for our current educational moment==, in which policy makers are eager to increase kids‚Äô interest in the ‚ÄúSTEM‚Äù disciplines ‚Äî science, technology, engineering and math. Schools and governments have spent millions on ‚Äúlet‚Äôs get kids coding‚Äù initiatives, yet it may well be that Minecraft‚Äôs impact will be greater.\n\n\u003e Ito points out that when kids delve into this ==hackerlike side of the game== ‚Äî concocting redstone devices or creating command blocks ‚Äî they often wind up consulting discussion forums online, where they get advice from adult Minecraft players. These folks are often full-time programmers who love the game, and so younger kids and teenagers wind up in conversation with professionals.\n\u003e \n\u003e ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs one of the places where young people are engaging with more expert people who are much older than them,‚Äù Ito says. These connections are transformative: ==Kids get a glimpse of a professional path that their schoolwork never illuminates.== ‚ÄúAn adult mentor opens up these new worlds that wouldn‚Äôt be open to them,‚Äù she adds. Of course, critics might worry about kids interacting with adults online in this way, but as Ito notes, when there‚Äôs a productive task at hand, ==it‚Äôs similar to how guilds have passed on knowledge for ages: knowledgeable adults mentoring young people.==\n\n\u003e ==Ito has also found that kids‚Äô impulse to tinker with Minecraft pushes them to master real-world technical skills.== One 15-year-old boy I interviewed, Eli, became interested in making ‚Äútexture packs.‚Äù These are the external shells that wrap around 3-D objects in the game, like a drape thrown over a table: Change the pattern on the drape, and you can change what the object looks like. Designing texture packs prompted Eli to develop sophisticated Photoshop skills. He would talk to other texture-¬≠pack designers on Minecraft forums and get them to send him their Photoshop files so he could see how they did things. He also began teaching himself to draw. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd be downloading the mod,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúlooking at the original texture and saying, ‚ÄòO.K., how can I make this a little more cartoony?‚Äô‚Äâ‚Äù Then he would put his own designs up on the forums to get feedback, which, he discovered, was usually very polite and constructive. ‚ÄúThe community,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúis very helpful.‚Äù\n\n\u003e For Ito, this is all a culturally useful part of the experience: ==Kids become more resilient, both practically and philosophically.== ‚ÄúMinecraft is busted, and you‚Äôre constantly fixing it,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs that home-brew aesthetic. It‚Äôs kind of broken all the time. It‚Äôs laggy. The kids get used to the idea that it‚Äôs broken and you have to mess with it. You‚Äôre not complaining to get the corporate overlord to fix it ‚Äî you just have to fix it yourself.‚Äù\n\n\u003e ‚ÄúIn Minecraft, ==knowledge becomes social currency==,‚Äù says Michael Dezuanni, an associate professor of digital media at Queensland University of Technology in Australia. Dezuanni has studied how middle-¬≠school girls play the game, watching as they engaged in nuanced, Talmudic breakdowns of a particular creation. This is, he realized, a significant part of the game‚Äôs draw: It offers many opportunities to display expertise, when you uncover a new technique or strategy and share it with peers.\n\n\u003e Most online games don‚Äôt require kids to manage the technical aspects of how gamers interact...But Minecraft is unusual because Microsoft doesn‚Äôt control all the servers where players gather online.\n\n\u003e What this means is that ==kids are constantly negotiating what are, at heart, questions of governance.== Will their world be a free-for-all, in which everyone can create and destroy everything? What happens if someone breaks the rules? Should they, like London, employ plug-ins to prevent damage, in effect using software to enforce property rights? There are now hundreds of such governance plug-ins.\n\n\u003e Seth Frey, a postdoctoral fellow in computational social science at Dartmouth College, has studied the behavior of thousands of youths on Minecraft servers, and he argues that their interactions are, essentially, teaching ==civic literacy.==\n\n\u003e Running a server becomes a crash course in how to compromise, balance one another‚Äôs demands and resolve conflict.\n\n\u003e Several parents and academics I interviewed think ==Minecraft servers offer children a crucial ‚Äúthird place‚Äù to mature==, where they can gather together outside the scrutiny and authority at home and school. Kids have been using social networks like Instagram or Snapchat as a digital third place for some time, but Minecraft imposes different social demands, because kids have to figure out how to respect one another‚Äôs virtual space and how to collaborate on real projects.\n\n\n\u003e His son, Joseph says, is ‚Äúat home but still getting to be with a friend using technology, going to a place where they get to use pickaxes and they get to use shovels and they get to do that kind of building. I wonder how much Minecraft is meeting that need ‚Äî that need that all children have.‚Äù ==In some respects, Minecraft can be as much social network as game.==\n\n\u003e ==Just as Minecraft propels kids to master Photoshop or video-¬≠editing, server life often requires kids to acquire complex technical skills.== One 13-year-old girl I interviewed, Lea, was a regular on a server called Total Freedom but became annoyed that its administrators weren‚Äôt clamping down on griefing. So she asked if she could become an administrator, and the owners said yes.\n\n\u003e Mimi Ito has found that the ==kids who acquire real-world skills from the game ‚Äî learning logic, administering servers, making YouTube channels ‚Äî tend to be upper middle class.== Their parents and after-¬≠school programs help them shift from playing with virtual blocks to, say, writing code. So educators have begun trying to do something similar, bringing Minecraft into the classroom to create lessons on everything from math to history. Many libraries are installing Minecraft on their computers.","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.743605337Z","tags":null},"/Sources/The-Need-for-Certainty":{"title":"The Need for Certainty","content":"## Reference\n- **Source:** [[William O'Malley]], [[Atlas/Maps/DLQ 10 MOC]]\n- **Keywords:** [[Cards/permanent notes]]\n\t- #religion #spirituality \n- **Relevant Notes:** \n\t- [[Cards/Absolute Certainty versus Wonder]]\n\n## Notes\nIn this reading taken from¬†_Help My Unbelief_, O'Malley challenges our human impulse towards certainty and shows how faith can flourish precisely without claiming that one has absolute certitude.\n\n### Reflection Questions\n-   **Why did O'Malley call faith a \"calculated risk\"?**\n\t- Rethinking Certitudes\n\t\t- \"Unexpected challenges built right into our lives are evidence God doesn't want us to settle too long with insights even into our own souls.\"\n\t\t- Why is it hard to believe?\n\t\t\t- The distillation of all that is *Christian* is all based on the existence of Jesus...\n\t\t\t\t- Two truths: (1) Jesus died so that he could rise; (2) 1 Cor 15:17 states: \"If Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile\"\n\t\t\t\t- Christianity depends on those two truths...they make Christians continue to imitate Jesus (a.k.a. give love even when they get nothing out of it)\n\t\t\t- It's also difficult to accept the Catholic Church because of the church itself\n\t\t\t- Finally...how can a good God exist if he allows evil to happen?\n\t- The Need for Certainty\n\t\t- Richard Dawkins: \"Faith is the great cop-out, the great excuse to evade the need to think and evaluate evidence.

They seem to pursue two major goals.\n\t- The ==redistribution of social goods and opportunities== in the form of the (unlawful and direct) acquisition of collective consumption (land, shelter, piped water, electricity, roads), public space (street pavements, intersections, street parking places), opportunities (favourable business conditions, locations, labels, licenses), and other life chances essential for survival and acceptable standards.\n\t\t- Basically socialism lol\n\t- The other goal is ==attaining autonomy==, both cultural and political, from the regulations, institutions and discipline imposed by the state and modern institutions.\n\t\t- Not only do the poor seek autonomy, they also need security from state surveillance because ==an informal life in the conditions of modernity is also an insecure life.== \n### Becoming Political\n- The states‚Äô position vis-√†-vis this type of activism is affected‚Ä¶\n\t- first, by the extent of their capacity to exercise surveillance, \n\t- second, by the dual nature of the quiet encroachment (infringing on property, power and privilege, and, simultaneously, being a self-help activity)\n- The sources of conflict between the actors and the state are not difficult to determine.\n\t- First, the distribution of public goods free-of-charge exerts heavy pressure on the resources which the state controls. \n\t- Secondly, the quest for autonomy in everyday life creates a serious void in the domination of the modern state.\n\t\t- Moreover, autonomy and informality (of agents, activities, and spaces) deprive the states of the necessary knowledge to exert surveillance.\n- The ==streets serve as the only locus of collective expression== for, but by no means limited to, those who generally lack an institutional setting to express discontent\n\t- For many of these disenfranchised, the streets are the main, perhaps the only, place ==where they can perform their daily functions== ‚Äì to assemble, make friends, earn a living, spend their leisure time and express discontent. \n\t- Streets are also the public places w==here the state has the most evident presence==, which is expressed in police patrol, traffic regulations and spatial divisions ‚Äì in short, public ordering.\n\t- The power relationship between the encroachers and the authorities is what I have termed ‚Äú[[Street politics]].‚Äù\n\t\t- Two key factors render the streets an arena of politics.\n\t\t\t- First is the use of public space as a ==site of contestation== between the actors and the authorities.\n\t\t\t- The second element shaping street politics is the ==operation of a passive network== among the people who use and operate in the public space ‚Äì an instantaneous communication among atomised individuals which is established by a tacit recognition of their common identity, and which is mediated through space.\n\n### Conclusion\n","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.743605337Z","tags":null},"/Sources/The-Rise-and-Fall-of-Internet-Art-Communities-Essay":{"title":"The Rise and Fall of Internet Art Communities - Essay","content":"## Information\n- **Source:** [[Kelsey Ables]]\n- **Tags:** \n- **Notes:** \n\n## Highlights\n\u003e Before big tech shepherded the vast number of online users onto a handful of sleek websites, there was a scrappier internet‚Äîwhere offbeat chat rooms and eccentric niche websites reigned, and carefully crafted ‚Äúaway statuses‚Äù were a kind of personal branding‚Äîback when you could be away from the internet. ==Until attention spans became a commodity, the internet was dreamed of as a ‚Äúbastion for people to direct their own education,‚Äù== as Charles Broskoski, co-founder of internet bookmarking site [are.na](http://are.na/), remembers.\n\n\u003e The internet presented a ==breadth of opportunity for all kinds of artists==‚Äîoften of marginalized identities or with artistic interests unrecognized by institutions.\n\n\u003e Before advanced search engines, information floated on databases like a string of scattered islands. ==Communities formed out of necessity to help early users surf the boundless web.==\n\n\u003e Unlike the quantifiable interactions that pass for interactivity in 2019, such as ‚Äúlikes‚Äù and ‚Äúreactions,‚Äù there was genuine engagement in DeviantArt‚Äôs chat rooms and forums. ‚ÄúA culture developed on DeviantArt where comments simply saying things like ‚Äòcool!‚Äô and ‚Äònice!‚Äô were frowned upon,‚Äù Van Baarle explained. ‚ÄúPeople wanted in-depth comments and feedback, with constructive criticism.‚Äù Today, she added, ==the quality of conversation is ‚Äúdisappearing on the big social-media platforms like Instagram.‚Äù==\n\n\u003e Then, in the 2010s, Instagram capitalized on the mass adoption of smartphones, and Facebook grew into a site larger than any country in the world.

We rarely think about this sort of natural, basic self-centredness because it‚Äôs so socially repulsive. But it‚Äôs pretty much the same for all of us. It is our default setting, hard-wired into our boards at birth.\n- learning how to think really means learning how to exercise some control over how and what you think. It means being conscious and aware enough to choose what you pay attention to and to choose how you construct meaning from experience. Because if you cannot exercise this kind of choice in adult life, you will be totally hosed. Think of the old clich√© about ‚Äúthe mind being an excellent servant but a terrible master.‚Äù\n- If you‚Äôre automatically sure that you know what reality is, and you are operating on your default setting, then you, like me, probably won‚Äôt consider possibilities that aren‚Äôt annoying and miserable. But if you really learn how to pay attention, then you will know there are other options. It will actually be within your power to experience a crowded, hot, slow, consumer-hell type situation as not only meaningful, but sacred, on fire with the same force that made the stars: love, fellowship, the mystical oneness of all things deep down.\n- in the day-to-day trenches of adult life, there is actually no such thing as atheism. There is no such thing as not worshipping. Everybody worships. The only choice we get is what to worship. And the compelling reason for maybe choosing some sort of god or spiritual-type thing to worship‚Äìbe it JC or Allah, be it YHWH or the Wiccan Mother Goddess, or the Four Noble Truths, or some inviolable set of ethical principles‚Äìis that pretty much anything else you worship will eat you alive.\n- The really important kind of freedom involves attention and awareness and discipline, and being able truly to care about other people and to sacrifice for them over and over in myriad petty, unsexy ways every day.\n- That is real freedom. That is being educated, and understanding how to think. The alternative is unconsciousness, the default setting, the rat race, the constant gnawing sense of having had, and lost, some infinite thing.\n","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.743605337Z","tags":null},"/Sources/Trick-Mirror-Book":{"title":"Trick Mirror - Book","content":"#unfinished\n## Information\n- **Source:** [[Jia Tolentino]]\n- **Tags:** #nonfiction #essays\n- **Notes:** [[Trick Mirror (Literature Notes)]]\n\n## Highlights\n- As more people began to register their existence digitally, a pastime turned into an imperative: you had to register yourself digitally to exist.\n    - The I in the Internet, p. 5\n- The call of self-expression turned the village of the internet into a city, which expanded at time-lapse speed, social connections bristling like neurons in every direction.\n    - The I in the Internet, p. 7\n- Where we had once been free to be ourselves online, we were now chained to ourselves online, and this made us self-conscious.\n    - The I in the Internet, p. 7\n- But you can‚Äôt just walk around and be visible on the internet‚Äîfor anyone to see you, you have to act.\n    - The I in the Internet, p. 8\n- our world‚Äîdigitally mediated, utterly consumed by capitalism‚Äîmakes communication about morality very easy but makes actual moral living very hard.\n    - The I in the Internet, p. 9\n- The internet reminds us on a daily basis that it is not at all rewarding to become aware of problems that you have no reasonable hope of solving.\n    - The I in the Internet, p. 11\n- five intersecting problems: first, how the internet is built to distend our sense of identity; second, how it encourages us to overvalue our opinions; third, how it maximizes our sense of opposition; fourth, how it cheapens our understanding of solidarity; and, finally, how it destroys our sense of scale.\n    - The I in the Internet, p. 12\n- The self is not a fixed, organic thing, but a dramatic effect that emerges from a performance.

The things you learn by yourself stick; the things that are ‚Äútaught‚Äù to you do not stick.**  \n\u003e \n\u003e The fundamental principle of education is to ==give students an environment, and tools, _where they can make discoveries themselves_==. This requires ==space, and time, and autonomy.  ==\n\u003e \n\u003e Students also need to be able to _choose_ what they learn and how they learn it, something that modern rigid curriculums and prison-like school environments do not permit.\n\n\u003e **2. Video games provide a much deeper understanding of most subjects than classical education does.**\n\n\u003e **3. Schooling mostly fails at giving you this ==deep understanding.==**\n\u003e\n\u003e  It took humans _thousands of years_ to really figure out that reality was made of atoms, and understand why this was true. Reality has [a surprising amount of detail](http://johnsalvatier.org/blog/2017/reality-has-a-surprising-amount-of-detail). The deeper you get into these questions, the more you realize that nothing is simple. ==But school didn‚Äôt leave us room to dive deep into these questions; we had to pass exams, which meant dutifully learning to calculate molecular weights, etc, without actually understanding a thing.  ==\n\u003e  The net result is: no understanding, years of waste.  \n  \n\u003e This sounds absurd, but consider that **simulations are already used widely for learning:**\n\n\u003e A video game is just: ==(a) a simulation of reality  (b) with fast feedback loops.== \n\u003e \n\u003e Learning is just the act of engaging with an external thing and performing many conjecture/criticism loops, forming conclusions, and building on them to form a body of knowledge.  \n\u003e \n\u003e So it makes sense that video games would be the primary educational environment of the future: ==they are the best way we have of (a) creating simulations of reality (b) with fast feedback loops (c) accessible at low cost.==\n\n\u003e **5. Where games mostly fall short is that they‚Äôre not that transferable to the real world. The skills you learn are highly _specific to that game_. This will change.**\n\n\u003e **6. It is currently too hard to make video games. Making it easier to create video games will massively increase the supply of good video games and cause a gradual revolution in education.**\n\u003e \n\u003e One thesis of the internet that always stuck with me comes from Evan Williams, who founded Twitter/Blogger/Medium. ==He said that the best way to create a giant internet company is to take something people want to do and make it 10x easier.==\n\n\u003e Another insight is that ==_making things easier has nonlinear effects_. ==Making something 10x easier can cause 1000x more of that thing to happen. Hence the explosion of online creativity you see on YouTube, with chess, Minecraft, math videos, Khan Academy, Twitchstreams, Soundcloud, etc; you remove a small bit of friction and get a large result.\n\n\u003e this is also why AI is important for human productivity. Most of the discourse is about how AI will ‚Äúreplace‚Äù humans. I prefer the Licklider school of thought: human-computer symbiosis. AI will make humans vastly more effective by automating tedious tasks. For example, humans can use text AI such as GPT-3 to generate ideas/boilerplate writing to get around the terror of the blank page, and then simply pick the best ones and refine/iterate on those. (AI Dril, which was based on GPT-2, was an early example of this). ==As AI gets better, ‚Äúassistive creativity‚Äù will become a bigger thing, enabling humans to create sophisticated artifacts (including video games!) easier and better than ever.==\n\nrelate to [[Sources/Computers and Creativity - Thesis]], and how blockchain simplifies things (code -\u003e makes it easier to creat and to trust)","lastmodified":"2023-12-01T06:26:13.743605337Z","tags":null},"/Sources/Wellness-Wisdom-Newsletter":{"title":"Wellness Wisdom - Newsletter","content":"## Information\n- **Source:** [[Patricia Mou]]\n- **Tags:** #wellness #mentalhealth #personaldevelopment #spirituality #philosophy \n- **Notes:** [[Miscellaneous Notes/Literature Notes/Wellness Wisdom - Literature Notes]]\n\n## Highlights\n### Vol. 23\n- Optimizing creativity and play as another goal to conquer is also a ==manifestation of an ego== that desires to remain in control and ‚Äúbe the best at x‚Äù.\n- Antidote: ==awareness==\n- Mr. Money Moustache ==Sweet Spot==\n- You can see this in mindfulness/creativity, sports like running, fame, careerbuilding, and more\n- Doing an audit of your most extreme experiences, can help you calibrate towards your sweet spot.\n- as we become more wise, we‚Äôre able to remain in ==equilibrium== through non-attachment to these peaks and troughs.\n-  ==The Golden Mean== is a sliding scale for determining what is virtuous.
