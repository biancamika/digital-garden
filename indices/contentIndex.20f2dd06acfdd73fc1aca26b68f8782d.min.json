Write a 2-6 page proposal paper for¬†**your own original biological¬†_novum_**¬†that you wish to feature in your final project, as well as the¬†**form**¬†the project will take: the¬†**mode, platform, or genre**¬†with which you want to showcase your¬†_novum_.\n- The¬†_novum_¬†has to be biological, and you should discuss it briefly in terms of¬†**Suvin's concepts (i.e. how it displays [[Permanent Notes/Cognition]] and [[Permanent Notes/Estrangement]])**¬†as well as the¬†**framework of a sign (i.e. what scientific ideas and science fiction tropes it uses as signifiers, what socio-cultural concepts and/or experiences it signifies, and how these elements interact in the final¬†_novum_)**.\n- We suggest beginning with a simple formulation to ground your proposal: something like¬†**\"My project will focus on a [_novum_] that uses [biological concept/s] as signifiers to stand for [social/cultural idea/s] as signified.\"**¬†\n\t- If you're proposing multiple¬†_nova_¬†at this stage (perhaps to get our feedback on which one/s we think might be viable), do one for each one you're proposing. \n\t- For example, the writers behind¬†_The Last of Us_¬†might say, \"My project will focus on a zombie outbreak that uses the ant-zombifying cordyceps fungus as a signifier and uses it to stand for ruthless, inhuman survivalism in a crisis as the signified.\"\n- When you tell us what form/s you're considering, please also walk us through how you imagine the project working or progressing: if it's a narrative work, walk us through the story and how the plot will engage and reveal the¬†_novum_; if it's a piece of visual art, tell us how you'll produce it and how that will showcase the¬†_novum_¬†you're working on.\n- It would help to think about how the¬†_novum_¬†and the form of the project will interact. \n\t- If you're working on a disease¬†_novum_, for example, or a creature with multiple stages in its life cycle, you might want to choose a form that allows you to highlight progression, like a short story or an audio drama. \n\t- If you've got a flair for art or design, you might want to make a¬†_novum_¬†that's visually arresting and cool to look at. That sort of thing. This should be a coherent project, which means form and content interacting well with each other.\n\n### Ideas\n#### *Novum*\n- Tapeworm made for losing weight\n\t- How it displays cognition and estrangement\n\t\t- Cognition: \n\t\t- Estrangement: defamiliarizes \n\t- Framework of a sign\n\t\t- Sign: tapeworm diet put in pills and smoothies\n\t\t- Signifiers: genetic engineering, parasite worms? alien?\n\t\t- Signified: the misinformation behind fad diets and the desperation that drives their target audience \n\t- planned obsolecence \n- Implants made for optimizing the human?\n\t- Signifiers\n\t\t- cyberpunk inspired... cybernetic augmentation\n\t\t- Robot companions...Can get inspiration from \"The Lifecycle of Software Objects\"\n\t\t- Artificial wombs\n\t\t- Inspiration from AI companions like Replika\n\t\t- could be alien bioware?\n\t- transhumanism\n\t- a \"second brain\"...growing your own brain? human flash drive?

They will be used to signify misinformation-fuelled diet culture and its victims: people who will resort to desparate measures just to get their desired bodies.\n\nOne inspiration behind this *novum* is my mother, who happens to be one of these people. Being overweight is one of her greatest insecurities. Rather than committing to sustainable healthy habits, what she'd often do instead is buy all the popular diet powders, teas, pills, etc. She'd even offer these to me as well, knowing that I also want to lose weight. Whenever I'd question her on the effectiveness of these products, she'd never be able to defend them properly (she'd always gain the weight she initially lost from trying them); however, even after being reminded of their unreliability, she'd still continue buying them. Thus, I can't help but recognize this kind of cognitive dissonance whenever I see a popular diet supplement.\n\nAnother inspiration is the dangerous tapeworm diet. I find it disturbing how people ‚Äî particularly women ‚Äî have been purposefully infecting themselves for years (even since the [Victorian era](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/the-horrifying-legacy-of-the-victorian-tapeworm-diet)) despite all the unpleasant side effects. Aside from tapeworms, I am also considering the giardia parasite as the signifier. Here is an interesting excerpt from Schrage's [\"High-Tech Tapeworms Could Be the Diet Fad of the Next Century\"](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1991-09-19-fi-3549-story.html): \n\n\u003eActually, it turns out that tapeworms are probably the wrong parasite for weight management. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of mythology surrounding tapeworms,‚Äù says Dickson Despommier, a Columbia University professor of public health and microbiology. ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt really induce weight loss; they don‚Äôt eat enough to compete with our digestive systems for food.‚Äù\n\u003e\n\u003eHowever, Despommier points to¬†_giardia lamblia_¬†as a parasite with potential. A protozoa (basically, a flagellate with an attitude) that‚Äôs responsible for creating particularly nasty cases of diarrhea, giardia does have one fascinating property: It generates a chemical that prevents the human digestive system from absorbing animal fat.\n\u003e\n\u003eThe trick, says Despommier, would be to figure out giardia‚Äôs active ingredient and synthesize it. ‚ÄúThat would be outstanding,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIf you could find out from giardia what its molecular secret was to prevent the absorption of animal fat . . . it‚Äôs a straightforward logical extension for the biology of this organism.‚Äù\n\u003e\n\u003eTheoretically, you could create ‚Äúanti-fat‚Äù pills from this agent or even cultivate specially bred bowel colonies of giardia that block the fat without generating the runs. It‚Äôs not clear if pharmaceutical companies have begun to explore this parasite‚Äôs potential--but there‚Äôs no question that such research would be both technically feasible and possibly enormously profitable.\n\nConsuming parasites already makes weight loss terrifying and bizarre, but it's still too close to reality (unfortunately). Genetically engineering parasites to become symbionts would bring weight loss pills into the realm of the unreal. However, I worry that removing all the negative side-effects of infections would diminish the *novum*'s signified. To tackle this, I'm considering making zombification the pills' main consequence (similar to [Mira Grant's *Parasitology* series](https://www.goodreads.com/series/99015-parasitology)). Perhaps taking these pills would turn wannabe dieters into perpertual salespeople; their living days would be fully consumed by trying to market these pills to others (Yes, I'm cracking down on MLMs. Looking at you, USANA!).\n\nFor the form of this project, I want to make a website for promoting the fictional weight loss pills. This would feature the benefits of these pills, results from clinical trials, and success stories shared by customers. These main parts (along with other sections like FAQ and Disclaimer) will be used to showcase the *novum*.  I am still debating whether I want to make this website look professional, or as scammy as possible (through dark marketing tactics).\n\n#### Mail-to-order Partners\nMy project will focus on artificially made mail-to-order brides/husbands. Human reproductive cloning and genetic engineering are used as signifiers to stand for the commodification of life and love, along with the unequal power dynamic behind many transnational relationships.\n\nThe main inspiration behind this *novum* is [Yvette Tan's \"Seek Ye Whore\"](https://web.archive.org/web/20220811151400/https://yvettetan.com/2019/02/11/seek-ye-whore/), which features siquijorbrides.com: a fictional website for inhuman mail-to-order brides. The protagonist, a middle-aged American male, orders one to use as a servant and blow-up doll, and ends up getting more than what he wished for. While reading this story, I was reminded of how acquiring this kind of relationship is so easy nowadays; technology (the Internet) mediates it, media (*90 Day Fiance*) promotes it, and culture (colonial mentality) sustains it. Aside from this, I also find inspiration in  AI humans like [Star Labs' NEONs](https://neonlife.ai/) and [Replika's companions](https://replika.com/). I'm intrigued by technologies behind these creations and people are reacting to them. A notable example: Replika's recent shutting down of its erotic roleplay functionality left much of its community devastated, to the point that [many of its members were sharing suicide prevention resources](https://knowyourmeme.com/news/replika-ai-shuts-down-erotic-role-play-community-shares-suicide-prevention-resources). Putting these two inspirations together, I can't help but think about how  dehumanization seems utterly inescapable in a capitalist system; even non-human species like monsters and robots don't seem to have a chance. What better way of reflecting this truth than the production of humans for the sake of \"marriage\"?\n\nThus, this project will be centered on a biotech company making and selling such humans, aiming to provide everyone in the world (who can afford it) the perfect match. However, since perfection is contextually dependent, the company will be providing a variety of humans to choose from. The only characteristic shared by all the models would be their physically optimal condition (i.e. youthful and healthy, high libido). A particular question I'd like to explore (inspired by Ted Chiang's \"The Lifecycle of Software Objects\") is the personality expression of an artificially made human: if a person purchases their dream partner, would this partner come with a personality or not? While I think the buyer would be able to dictate certain inclinations (e.g. less aggressive, more social), I believe that the partner's personality would develop further when they're already in contact with the buyer.  \n\nFor the form of this project, I will make a website for  selling these mail-to-order partners. The design of this will be based off existing dating websites, where potential partners can be filtered by physical characteristics (e.g. age, ethnicity, height and weight, hair and eye color, body type, etc.). If a user doesn't find anything they like from the ready-made selection, they can choose to order their own. The made-to-order page will allow a user to choose the physical characteristics they'd want for their partner. The website will also contain pages (such as \"Learn More\" and \"FAQ\") that dive deep into the production process of these partners. I'm planning to use AI-generated art for the visuals of these partners in order to make them look both perfect and uncanny. \n\n\n\n#### Influencer Hivemind\nMy project will focus on a human hivemind consisting of content creators that uses eusociality, nanotechnology, and the group mind as signifiers to signify the exploitative nature of the social media industry ‚Äî for both influencers and their audiences.\n\nFor the form of this project, I will write an expos√© that also serves as an interactive article (similar to [the Guidon's interactives](https://interactive.theguidon.com/)).  \n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T15:56:56.984136039Z","tags":null},"/Creation/Developh-Camp":{"title":"Developh Camp","content":"## Foundations\n### Identity \u0026 Practice\n#### Tatlong problema ng Pinoy creators\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFm6EId2Tyc\n1. **Our work is undervalued**\n\t1.

Brock discuss this theory in their book Fast Food Education. They define education as ‚Äúwhat is left over when you forget everything that your teacher made you memorize when you were in school.‚Äù (41) This book discusses the flaws in today‚Äôs education system and how it can be altered to benefit more students. I agree with this book‚Äôs beliefs on education and the authors present the information with an interesting and gripping metaphor. \n\u003e \n\u003e The authors believe that ==education is poorly scaled.== Students are put into grades based on age and not on readiness to proceed to the next grade level. The authors thought to ‚Äúimagine that a major auto manufacturer had decided that they would move an auto to the next stage of the assembly line as long as the work was at least 65% complete.‚Äù (25) Just like with cars, students will not succeed without fully completing a stage in the ‚Äúassembly line‚Äù. When students partially understand the material, they pass the test, and then forget everything they just learned. Taylor and Brock believe that ==a student should completely understand the material before they are allowed to proceed to the following grade.== Teachers complain that students constantly stay they did not learn that from last year, when they did. They just forget it once the test is over. ==If education was scaled based on readiness, then students would absorb and comprehend all the information before moving onto the next grade. ==\n\u003e \n\u003e Because the schools are not putting in the effort to teach children like they should be, children are not putting in the effort as well. ==Fast food is made quickly and the same for everybody. That is what is happening with education. No matter what learning technique a student needs, everybody learns the same way.== This way of teaching leads students to solely do work to earn a good grade. No one wants to absorb new information just to gain more knowledge anymore. Students are given the material to memorize then they take a test. Once they pass the test, the curriculum exits the brain. Now, some teachers cram the lessons into their students‚Äô brains so the kids will pass and they will not get fired or in trouble for being a poor teacher because all his/her kid‚Äôs passed. In order to curve teacher‚Äôs from viewing education like this, Taylor and Brock believe in ==natural education which is when ‚Äúwe learn by experiencing, failing, working hard to make adjustments, experiencing success, and honing our skills.‚Äù== (46) This is a better method of teaching than having students memorize random facts they cannot connect to the world with. ==Education today needs to allow the students to problem solve in situations they will actually come across, not when train A leaves the station from Oregon and train B leaves the station from Boston, etc.== These authors believe that natural education will greatly benefit the future generations. \n\u003e \n\u003e Similarly to the flaws that Taylor and Brock see in education, the documentary Waiting for Superman discusses these issues. Families are taking their children out of public schools so they can have a better education. In public schools, the kids were being taught through memorization and based off the teacher‚Äôs desire to not fail, when it should be based off the teacher‚Äôs desire to inspire children. The families in the documentary feel that their children are not getting the education that they need and deserve. If Taylor and Brock‚Äôs idea of natural education was implemented in schools then maybe these families would not feel the need to pull their students out of public school. \n\u003e \n\u003e I believe that no one should have to pull their children out of public school because they do not think that their child is getting a good education. This book does a good job expressing the beliefs of the authors without being a boring book lecturing on about the problems with education. Taylor and Brock make the book relatable and thought-provoking through their real-life metaphors. Normally, I am not a fan of fiction books unless it is on a topic I am truly passionate about, but this book is the exception. \n\n[With Success In Fast Food And Fast Fashion, Is It Time For Fast Education?](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2020/10/20/with-success-in-fast-food-and-fast-fashion-is-it-time-for-fast-education/?sh=6bd18c55ce61)\n\u003e The ==digital revolution== and ==affordable internet access== arrived in the 1990s and made almost any B2C industry (always fragmented) fast. \n\n\u003e As life speeds up, ==not everyone can afford to learn that long==, so we have a trend toward faster education.\n\n\u003e ==Global digitalization== pushed many educational programs online, and these courses tend to become shorter.\n\n\u003e Fast education means ==shorter lessons==. Bite-sized learning is one of the key educational trends of the 21st century that brings comfort. You study at your own pace whenever and wherever you want. Educational courses can be divided into smaller parts so that you don‚Äôt need more than 15 minutes a day to study.\n\n\u003e You can study ==for free==, which is often time-consuming, using, for example, university courses on popular educational platforms. Alternatively, you may need to spend some time on YouTube before finding the quality trainer or course that suits you best. Or you can opt for specialized course providers that will improve your skills for a relatively small fee. \n\n\u003e Fast education will mean ==fast changes== and ==quick adaptation== of the latest trends. \n\n[Global survey reveals growing interest in shorter programmes and lifelong learning](https://monitor.icef.com/2019/10/global-survey-reveals-growing-interest-in-shorter-programmes-and-lifelong-learning/)\n\u003e As for what is prompting the shift in approach among learners, John Fallon, CEO of Pearson, says that ‚Äúthe ==new talent economy== has arrived with its gig jobs, unconventional career paths and tech disruption.‚Äù\n\n\u003e Deloitte defines the talent economy, a relatively new term, as a ==‚Äúcollaborative, transparent, technology-enabled, rapid-cycle way of doing business ‚Ä¶ where employers and employees now seek each other out on a playing field that is broader and more level than ever before.‚Äù==\n\n\u003e The quickly changing needs of today‚Äôs developed economies means that students and professionals must adjust to new trends regularly and this is prompting growing interest in ==lifelong learning ‚Äì and learning that is often undertaken piece by piece.== These pieces may be degrees or smaller, more specialised credentials that may be more affordable and may also come from different institutions and from online platforms. The result is that students are considering a much wider range of programmes, institutions, and delivery models than they ever have, and this is the opportunity Pearson is identifying.\n\nCould perhaps also apply to emerging economies like the PH?\n\u003e The Pearson study found that an understanding of the need for lifelong learning is much more established in China and India than in the US and UK, ==‚Äúdriven in large part by the influence of technology and automation on their jobs.‚Äù== These are countries where keeping up with ‚Äì or better yet staying a step ahead of ‚Äì technological trends is crucial to getting and keeping steady employment.\n\n\u003e As for which way they could imagine ==upskilling==, the largest proportions said they would do it through ‚Äúa short training programme such as a boot-camp, certificate programme, or something offered by a professional association.‚Äù \n\n[THE THIRD EDUCATION REVOLUTION\n](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2018/03/the-third-education-revolution/556091/)\n\n\u003e Now a ==third wave in education and training== has arrived, argue economists, educators, and workforce-development officials. The level of preparation that worked in the first two waves‚Äîadding more time to education early in life‚Äîdoes not seem sufficient in the 21st-century economy. Instead the third wave is likely to be ==marked by continual training throughout a person‚Äôs lifetime‚Äîto keep current in a career, to learn how to complement rising levels of automation, and to gain skills for new work.== Workers will likely consume this lifelong learning in short spurts when they need it, rather than in lengthy blocks of time as they do now when it often takes months or years to complete certificates and degrees.\n\n[[Permanent Notes/Digital learning exacerbates and reproduces inequality]]\n\u003e One big worry, however, is that the arrival of lifelong education will only ==exacerbate the economic divide== that already exists in the United States. Education levels in the U.S. are closely tied to income. Simply put: Rich kids are far more likely to graduate from college than are their poor and working-class peers. There‚Äôs no reason not to believe that trend won‚Äôt continue in this third wave of lifelong learning. It is likely to help workers who already have high levels of education get the training they need rather than assist underemployed or unemployed workers who need to upskill to keep a job or get a new one.\n\n\u003e Two simultaneous forces in the job market are driving this push toward lifelong learning. The first is ==automation== and the ==widening divide between the lifetime earnings of high-school and college graduates.==\n\n\u003e The second is the ==emergence of the gig economy==, which is reshaping the traditional employer-employee relationship as more contractors and freelancers fill roles once reserved for full-time workers making good salaries. While the term ‚Äúthe gig economy‚Äù conjures up images of popular apps for temporary work, such as Uber and Task Rabbit, the army of professional white-collar freelancers is larger than that encompassing the services we can request on our smartphones. In a 2016 study, two economists, Lawrence F. Katz and Alan B. Krueger, found that all net employment growth in the United States since 2005 appears to have come from what they termed ‚Äúalternative work‚Äù‚Äîthat is, contract and freelance work, which has ballooned by more than 50 percent over the last decade.\n\n[[Permanent Notes/Critical thinking and skill development are not mutually exclusive]]\n\u003e Rather than focus on routine skills that can be replaced by technology, job training needs to target ==key skills that complement technology, such as problem solving, teamwork, and communication.==\n\n\u003e If training and education become a lifelong pursuit, the big question is ==how to pay for it.==\n\n\u003e ‚ÄúWhile we don‚Äôt know what skills will be required for the human-centric jobs of the future such as health care, management consultants, and financial planners,‚Äù said Alssid, who has spent more than two decades in the workforce-development field, ‚Äúwe do know that these jobs will require a ==highly adaptable workforce that can think critically, creatively, and work collaboratively to find solutions to rapidly developing, complex problems.==‚Äù\n\n\u003e Such skills, often referred to as ‚Äúsoft skills,‚Äù are typically seen in liberal-arts graduates, but those individuals often lack the technical skills employers want. Alssid said ==a hybrid of liberal-arts and technical education is what is most needed in training programs to allow workers to better navigate the ambiguity of the future job market.== That‚Äôs the goal of his school‚Äôs partnership with Infosys‚Äîto introduce liberal-arts students to technical fields that they might not have previously considered, while other programs will introduce the flexibility of the liberal arts to technical workers.\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/ryancraig/2021/05/28/lambada-school-the-forbidden-coding-bootcamp/?sh=48621b2c5762\n\nhttps://www.cpp.edu/~ddwills/courses/ant352/readings352/McDonaldization.htm\n\n\u003e A further extension involves the credentialing process.

Here's some food for thought: what have you been mostly spending on during the pandemic? Have you been living on a fast food diet? How about going broke from doom-shopping? Or maybe you're trying to reinvent yourself by taking numerous courses or participating in a bootcamp? Industries are being redefined by speed and scale: fast food, fast fashion, and now fast food education. Powered by technology, it's capable of disrupting the ancient higher education sector. It's great that more people than ever can pursue learning, right? But what is being marketed as empowerment can also be masqueraded exploitation. Let's explore this rising trend, from its origins to its implications.\n#### What is fast food education?\nFast food education is education influenced by what sociologist George Ritzer calls \"[[Permanent Notes/McDonaldization]]\": a rationalization process where principles of the fast food industry are dominating other sectors of society and the world. There are four characteristics of this worldview: efficiency, calculability, predictability, and control.\n\nFirst, **efficiency** is about choosing the fastest and least costly (in expenditure and effort) way to achieve a goal. This is specific to the interests of the industry/business, but usually advertised as a benefit to the consumer. However, they end up doing work that was previously done for them. This is the \"privilege\" they pay for; not only through paying higher prices, but also through spending time remembering numbers and learning new technologies.\n\nNext, **calculability** is about making objectives based on what can be calculated, counted, quantified. Under [[Permanent Notes/McDonaldization]], quanity equals quality; a large amount of product delivered to consumers is the same as a high quality product. Because of this, workers are judged by the speed at which they accomplish tasks instead of the quality of work they do. \n\nThen,  **predictability** is about reducing the possibility of surprise and differentness in an environment as much as possible. Consumers expect to receive the same product and service no matter where they go. Meanwhile, workers are always doing repetitive and highly routine tasks. People don't vary from the norm because they expect to profit, whether it be through a good meal or an okay salary.\n\nFinally, **control** is about replacing people ‚Äî the biggest source of uncertanity and unpredictability in a rationalizing system ‚Äî with nonhuman technology. Standardization is at play. Everything is pre-packaged, pre-measured, and automatically controlled. Thus, consumers and workers no longer have to think; all they have to do is follow instructions and push buttons ‚Äî just like a machine.\n\n[[Permanent Notes/McDonaldization]] has expressed itself in the education sector through [[Permanent Notes/Vocational education]]. It's known for a short timeframe, accessible costs, and a practical curriculum ‚Äî promising a career that liberal education couldn't guarantee. For this essay, I'll be focusing on example programs that are prominent in the edtech industry: compressed courses like MooCs and micro-credentials, and skills-based intensives such as bootcamps and cohort-based courses.\n\n(Maybe I should make a graph of fast food education with example startups?)\n\n##### Rise in popularity\nThese programs are part of what Selingo calls the [third education revolution](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2018/03/the-third-education-revolution/556091/): continual training throughout a person's lifetime. This has been brought about by the following forces: technological developments, the wage gap between college graduates and those with \"lesser education\", and the talent economy. \n\nFirst, technology has always served as the backbone of innovation. For instance, [fragmented B2C industries became fast thanks to the internet](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2020/10/20/with-success-in-fast-food-and-fast-fashion-is-it-time-for-fast-education/?sh=6bd18c55ce61) -- it made buying anything a few clicks away. Now, the same is happening to education; lessons are no longer taught in classrooms, but in videos and Zooms. This shift to remote learning has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Since education is more accessible, there's no excuse not to be learning.\n\nAnother technological driver of the third education revolution is automation. The wage gap between college graduates and those with \"lesser education\" continues to widen because of the fear that their jobs could end up automated. This worry isn't baseless; according to a [McKinsey report](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2018/03/the-third-education-revolution/556091/), this could happen to at least one-third of activities in about 60 percent of occupations by 2030. So to avoid losing their jobs, people have no choice but to upskill.\n\nFinally, there's the emergence of the [talent economy](https://monitor.icef.com/2019/10/global-survey-reveals-growing-interest-in-shorter-programmes-and-lifelong-learning/), which Deloitte defines as a ‚Äúcollaborative, transparent, technology-enabled, rapid-cycle way of doing business ‚Ä¶ where employers and employees now seek each other out on a playing field that is broader and more level than ever before\". This no longer includes just app-enabled gig workers, but also professional white-collar freelancers. Since today's economies have quickly changing needs, people need to adjust to new trends -- leading them to constant retraining.\n\nThe third education revolution is more pronounced in the Global South, especially Southeast Asia. According to a [Parthenon-EY paper](http://cdn.ey.com/parthenon/pdf/perspectives/Parthenon-EY_SE-Asia_Paper_final_092016_singles.pdf), economic growth, demographic trends, and cultural shifts have prompted regional demand for higher education. However, [socio-economic barriers](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/features/south-east-asia-higher-educations-next-global-hotspot) such as a global recession, outdated infrastructure, and political instability  have made higher education an inaccessible/undesirable option. Automation also has a huge influence; in fact, [many Southeast Asians](https://reboothq.substack.com/p/maintenance) participate in [ghost work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_work): the invisible human labor that powers the products and services of Silicon Valley. Thus, keeping up with technogical trends is integral to getting and staying employed.\n\nOverall, technological and economic developments have pushed people to pursue lifelong learning, but traditional institutions are unable to respond to the high demand due to expensive costs, long timeframes, and slow adaptation. In a [global Pearson study](https://monitor.icef.com/2019/10/global-survey-reveals-growing-interest-in-shorter-programmes-and-lifelong-learning/), less than six in ten respondents felt that their country's education system worked well for the current generation; more than four in ten respondents (in affulent countries like Australia, Canada, and the US) believed that higher education did not prepare them for their career. Now is a perfect time for disruption, which is why fast food education is currently thriving. \n\n#### Empowerment or exploitation?\nThere's no denying the benefits of fast food education. Compared to liberal education, it's more affordable in terms of time and cost spent. Its remote nature also opens it to people all over the world. The increased accessibility helps educate, train, and empower populations previously denied access to similar opportunities, like the Global South. This also reduces the magnitude of \"brain drain\" by allowing students to gain expertise locally, instead of having to migrate. As a result, the number of countries' highly skilled workers can be increased.\n\nBut no matter how much education is rationalized, there are bound to be irrational outcomes. Ritzer says: \"...Rational systems are unreasonable systems...they deny the basic humanity, the human reason, of the people who work within or are served by them.\" Aside from dehumanization, other irrationalities can occur (e.g. overquantification resulting to low quality). Here are the cons of fast food education:\n\n##### Questionable quality\nIn exchange for accessibility, fast food education is known for lower quality, from what is taught to how it is taught. Since it has a short timeframe, it can only focus on teaching practical skills and methods. For example: programs that teach code [favor convention over configuration (frameworks over fundamentals)](https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/bootcamps-wont-make-you-coder-heres-what-will-0), while those that teach UX design [skip foundational disciplines like anthropology and art history](https://essays.uxdesign.cc/case-study-factory/). These programs' curriculums aren't only lacking; they also have the danger of being unreliable. See Lambda School, who was criticized by their students for [constantly changing lesson plans and relying on free training materials](https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21131848/lambda-school-coding-bootcamp-isa-tuition-cost-free).\n\nDelivery of content is also important. One example is technical production; third-party providers have put their reputations at risk for [insufficient screening](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/reputations-at-risk-as-platforms-fail-to-screen-moocs/2014381.article), leading to the release of courses with shaky filming and conventional slides. Pacing must also be considered, of which MOOCs and bootcamps seem to be on opposite sides of the spectrum. The former is completely dependent on learners; most end up dropping out, leading to [completion rates lower than 10%](https://www.fastcompany.com/3021473/udacity-sebastian-thrun-uphill-climb). Meanwhile, the latter is known for being rapidly fast, so learners have to ensure that they can catch up.\n\nEven if one gets to finish a program, is the certificate they earned enough to prove what they learned? This would be difficult without accreditation; while this lack of oversight has enabled programs to constantly update their curriculums, it has also lessened their credibility -- which job-seeking students would benefit from. If [graduates already struggle with interviews](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2016-12-06/want-a-job-in-silicon-valley-keep-away-from-coding-schools), how else can they ensure that they would be hired? Students of fast food education will be at a disadvantage in the current market, which is more competitive than ever thanks to globalization and the internet.\n\n##### Homogenization\nOur global market mandates the idea of universal knowledge, skills, and values. The fact that coding bootcamps are an international phenonemon is proof of this; no matter what country they're in, they'll always be providing technical skills and interview prep. Through this standardization, fast food education brings about [cultural hybridization](https://sociologydictionary.org/cultural-hybridization/): the process of blending of two or more cultures in order to fit cultural norms. Allowing for variety speeds up historical, economic, and cultural development. However, cultural hybridization is becoming no different from [cultural hegemony](https://www.thoughtco.com/cultural-hegemony-3026121), where dominance is maintained through ideological/cultural means. In the case of fast food education, the Global North (especially countries in the West), is set as the universal standard for others to follow. As a result, students are subject to the homogenization of their work.\n\n(lol insert collage of coding bootcamp landing pages to show how similar they are....get some originality please LMAO)\n\nAn example of cultural hemegonization is [\"What can we learn from the new generation of designers?\"](https://youtu.be/YCsSKDh8gBg), where Lucas Coehlo talks about how he associated \"good design\" with his Euro-centric aesthetic of minimalist design, and was only able to question it because of a PoC junior. Who can blame him? Abundant white space may be a standard for quality design, but it can't be afforded by low-end magazines and East Asian media. Many design theories also happen to come from white males born decades ago. Due to standardization and fast pacing, fast food education programs limits their students' perspectives.\n\nTheir expression is also limited; student projects are often made with structured templates. For instance, [\"The case study factory\"](https://essays.uxdesign.cc/case-study-factory/) discusses how formulaic case studies make it difficult to diffrentiate UX/UI designers from one another. These studies may demonstrate the students' ability to follow the design process, but not their unique thinking, skills, and point of view. Having English as the main language adds to this. Minorities who aren't able to communicate well in it are sure to struggle, even if they are proficient in the craft. Overall, even if [imposing the logic of factory production on education kills creativity](http://bostonreview.net/forum/higher-education-age-coronavirus/r-h-lossin-andy-battle-resisting-distance-learning), those who fail comply to set standards will be seen as of \"lesser quality\".\n\n##### Equity problems\nFast food education may be more accessible to more people, but is it equitable? According to education researchers Mimi Ito and Justin Reich, digital learning technologies actually exacerbate inequality in learning outcomes in terms of class, race, and gender. They also unintentionally reproduce inequality, thanks to bias and social distance between creators and users. (See [[Permanent Notes/Digital learning exacerbates and reproduces inequality]])\n\nSociologist Paul Attwell argues that inequalities operate at two levels: the first and second digital divides. The former divide is about access: who is able to get devices, software, connectivity, and other forms of technology. To those without reliable internet (from [Seattle](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/disconnected-in-isolation-how-the-coronavirus-pandemic-shed-light-on-the-digital-divide/) to [Southeast Asia](https://phys.org/news/2020-03-lack-internet-access-southeast-asia.html)), remote learning is a far-off opportunity. The latter divide is about leverage; when poor and affulent students are given the same technologies, the former tend to use it for basic skills, while the latter were using it for higher forms of learning. Those who enroll in [MOOCs](https://outline.com/V2LCFh) and [bootcamps](https://www.insidehighered.com/views/2017/08/29/essay-how-coding-boot-camps-are-add-college-degree) tend to be well-off college graduates who already have jobs.\n\nMoney is also a barrier. Despite being marketed as the \"more affordable\" option, [bootcamps can cost in the range of $5,000 to $20,000](https://careerkarma.com/blog/bootcamp-market-report-2021/#bootcamp-costs-and-financing) ‚Äî nothing to cough at. Even the way cheaper [MOOCs are used to advertise higher priced professional programs](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereknewton/2018/11/19/beware-of-the-great-mooc-bait-and-switch/?sh=16d6f5c312f2). Income sharing agreements are marketed as an accessible option to those who aren't able to pay full price, but people need to be warned that ISAs are just another form of student debt; [Senator Elizabeth Warren](https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Letter%20to%20DeVos%20re%20ISAs.pdf) says that these carry many of the pitfalls of private student loans \"with the added danger of deceptive rhetoric and marketing that obscure their true nature\". Just because students get to study for free doesn't mean it didn't cost them. [A report on Lambda School students](https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21131848/lambda-school-coding-bootcamp-isa-tuition-cost-free) showed that some quit their jobs to attend full-time, while others worked nights and weekends in order to make ends meet. Many also admitted to struggling with mental health problems. When students have to deal with looming debt and [dubious placement outcomes](https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/bootcamps-wont-make-you-coder-heres-what-will-0), who can blame them for being disstressed?\n\n\nThese programs were created for a honorable purpose: to bring learning to those who couldn't access it. However, after years have passed, very little has changed. Those who gain the most from these programs are those who are predisposed to succeed. Meanwhile, those who need educational resources the most gain the least. Why is it this way? Where did we go wrong?\n\n#### System over student\nRemember: fast food education is designed to benefit the system, not the student. This system is [Lower Ed](https://tressiemc.com/uncategorized/the-lower-ed-ecosystem-bootcamps-edition/): a term coined by writer Tressie McMillian Cottom to refer to a sociological process of credentialism; its ecosystem includes programs such as microcredentials and bootcamps. According to her, Lower Ed was created by structural changes in the way we work, unequal access to liberal education programs, and the risk shift of job training from institutions to individuals for profit. Thus, it's exploitative in nature; it makes use of students' faith in education without challenging its market imperatives, and maintains race, class, and gender inequalities. \n\nStudents also lose out because of the curricula.  Its focus on hard skills and technical competencies is effective for producing workers, not well-rounded people. After all, according to [Udacity CEO Sebastian Thrun](https://www.fastcompany.com/3021473/udacity-sebastian-thrun-uphill-climb), \"... the true value proposition of education is employment.\" Yes, these programs may be great at creating jobs and boosting the economy. But their students are unable to think for themselves, leaving them condemned to forever serve their industrial and corporate bosses. \n\nYet, the students think of themselves as [saviors](https://www.stanforddaily.com/2018/02/16/silicon-valleys-saviorism-problem/). Living in a world where technical skills are sought after has led them to believe that they know what's best for others, especially marginalized communities. But the savior mindset is patronizing; it assumes that people are helpless just because they lack technical skills. Making solutions *for*, and not *with* people in need only ends up hurting them, perpetuating existing inequalities. ==opportunity for some nice tech x religion imagery here... startup bible...lol==\n\nOverall, fast food education upholds the status quo. Companies keep growing their talent and profits. Technology continues being evangelized like religion. And people keep getting dehumanized. [Researcher Matthew Kiem](https://modesofcriticism.org/the-imperial-code/) states that those who are technical are divided according to their dispensability; worse are those who aren't technical at all, seen as deficient. It's sad to see that despite being capable of building the future, students are only maintaining this kind of present.\n\n#### Call-to-action\n\"... The object of all true education is not to make [people] carpenters, but to make carpenters [people],\" said [sociologist W. E. B. Du Bois](https://glc.yale.edu/talented-tenth-excerpts). This is what fast food education should strive for. Democratizing technical skills is important, but developing these shouldn't be incompatible with cultivating critical thinking in students. To see how this can be achieved, let's take a look at [Tech Learning Collective](https://techlearningcollective.com/), an apprenticeship-based technology school which presents itself as an anti-bootcamp.\n\n[It approaches technology like gardening.](https://techlearningcollective.com/2019/07/22/want-to-get-good-with-computers-dont-start-with-code.html) One, its curriculum is focused on foundational skill building; the land must first be fertile before a garden can bloom on it. Instead of immediately teaching a coding language, instructors start with teaching digital infrastructure (e.g. security, networking, system administration). These basics are vital to programming; without sufficient understanding of infrastructure, developers write programs with more bugs and less functionality. By going back to their digital roots, students become more aware of their immediate environment. Numerous possibilities open up when these students realize they can do or make what they're being pressured to pay for (e.g. Big Tech v.s. open source).\n\nThe school also advocates for cross-pollination. Their workshops are interdisciplinary, melding technical topics with the humanities (e.g history, philosophy, social sciences). This allows for a more holistic development for the students. For instance, just like all the other courses, [cybersecurity has an explicitly political approach](https://techlearningcollective.com/2019/08/10/how-we-approach-cybersecurity-topics-at-the-tech-learning-collective.html). They prioritize teaching security first because of their target audience (activists are part) and numerous scandals (e.g. [2016 election \"hacking\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2016_United_States_elections), [Cambridge Analytica data mining](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/mar/17/the-cambridge-analytica-scandal-changed-the-world-but-it-didnt-change-facebook)). They also cultivate critical thinking by encouraging their students to scruitinize technology from an ethical standpoint. \n\nStated by Tech Learning Collective: \"...Our primary inquiries in...classes consider how we can leverage our digital devices for the most immediate social good...much like the advice encouraging you to eat foods whose ingredients you can pronounce and grown on soil you have left your footprints on, we believe that our engagement with technology ought to be as directly integrated as possible with our everyday lives...\" Thanks to their technological and political immersion, their students reclaim power over the work they do, getting to truly flourish. They will be truly capable of shaping the system we are all stuck in.\n\nPerhaps it's too ambitious to hold fast food education to the standards of a fine dining experience. But being responsible for the development of many is nothing to make light of, especially if they've been disenfranchised by society. [Education is not a product, but a process](https://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/just-visiting/moocs-are-dead-whats-next-uh-oh?cmdid=F31RY86F0UQCL1). What they get shouldn't be packaged shallow content, but rather building blocks to help them grow (just like nutritional food!). In short, democratizing holistic tech education is what is truly innovation. With all that the edtech industry is capable of, that hopefully won't be such a tall order to fill. ==(weak ending aaahhh)==\n\n--- \n## Cathexis\n### Curation\n#### Amazing Art\n+ **[Cognition diary:](https://www.behance.net/gallery/105592711/cognition-diary-2020)** A speculative design project by Lera Ganicheva, Cognition diary is a personalized learning tool and a knowledge base designed by people individually throughout their lives. It takes the form of a customizable VR space where buildings represent disciplines studied by the user. I love embodied learning (thanks to being both an educator and a dancer), so I also loved the concept behind this project! I hope to create a speculative design project of my own one day as well. Check out the full project here.\n+ **[Classroom design explorations:](https://twitter.com/azlenelza/status/1457346877163143170)** What would a classroom look like if it wasn't teacher-led, but instead teacher-curated?

As someone who struggles to sit still in a typical classroom, I am excited by the possibilities these sketches offer. \n#### Interesting Innovations\n+ **Teaching Machines:** https://www.edsurge.com/news/2021-06-15-new-book-explores-the-long-and-surprising-history-of-teaching-machines Automation is no stranger to education. Way before the advent of personal computers, inventors and researchers created \"teaching machines\" for revolutionizing education. In her book Teaching Machines, Audrey Watters argues  that this history is important for current educators \u0026 policy leaders to know. This quote of hers from an interview particularly struck me:\n\n\u003e ‚ÄúI wanted to tell a story that didn‚Äôt have anything to do with computers,‚Äù she says, noting how mechanical early teaching machines were. ‚ÄúBecause I think that too often in edtech, we get so hung up on the tech,‚Äù she adds. ‚ÄúWe're so committed to talking about the latest gadget, the new software, this or that app, that we really act as though somehow it's that the tech is all there is to talk about. That the tech is the driving force of change. That the tech is the driving force of history.‚Äù\n\nYou can check out the whole book here. \n+ **[Khan Academy Early Product Development / Long-term Research:](https://early.khanacademy.org/)** Combining practices from product design, academic research, and pedagogy, Khan Academy's experimental R\u0026D group sought to explore and uncover future possibilities in education. 3 years of experimentation resulted in interesting reports on building complex reasoning skills, exploring creative math, and more! I admire how 1.) intersectional this research is (I want to do similar work in the future) and 2.) it's open-source!

I love how concise these are, and I plan to incorporate them into my own learning philosophy. You can check out all the principles here. \n+ **[We Don't Need No Innovation:](https://logicmag.io/kids/we-dont-need-no-innovation/)** Written by Phil Nichols, this essay illustrates how a fight over school reforms in West Philadelphia revealed the pathologies and possibilities of disrupting education. Reading this made me rethink what it means to be innovative. I particularly like this last line: \n\u003e \"If 'innovation' is to be anything more than a buzzword‚Äîor a Trojan horse for austerity measures, urban development, and workforce production‚Äîit must be rooted in such a commitment to the self-determination and flourishing of the publics that schools are meant to serve.\"\n\nRead the whole essay here. \n+ **[The Future of Education:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0uw7Xc0fLk\u0026list=TLPQMTQxMDIwMjFLzdGjbz6JuQ\u0026index=4)** In this talk with Russell Brand, Yuval Noah Harari shared his thoughts on the future of humanity, talking about the challenges facing the next generation (and how they might be overcome). This whole conversation was a delight to listen to!

Sign me up! To be honest, I haven't fully listened to this yet, but I'm already intrigued by what I've seen, especially this quote from a 'becoming-manifesto' for posthuman education at the beginning:\n\u003e \"Posthuman education...creates spaces where we can be outside ourselves, be inside ourselves, be something else, be outside, be inside, be elsewhere but there, be not ourselves, be not a self at all but something and nothing all at the same time.

Introduction\n\t\t1. \"You'll find the future wherever people are having the most fun.\" - Steven Johnson, *Wonderland: How Play Made the Modern World*\n\t\t2. Talk about own personal story \n\t\t\t1. As a kid, I had fun in the Internet through games and art communities -\u003e all about creation\n\t\t\t2. E.G. creating graphics, roleplaying -\u003e creating stories\n\t\t\t3. Transition to present time, where I'm benefitting from skills I gained through fun exploration, not structured education (i.e. art and design)\n\t\t3. Now, I see kids around me growing the same way... (cite examples)\n\t\t\t1. future developers learning programming through games like Roblox + Minecraft\n\t\t\t2. future artists practicing drawing + marketing through fandom communities in Twitter, Tumblr, Discord, etc.\n\t\t4. These [Present-day hobbies will seed future industries](https://cdixon.org/2013/03/02/what-the-smartest-people-do-on-the-weekend-is-what-everyone-else-will-do-during-the-week-in-ten-years)\n\t\t5. So why aren't these hobbies taken seriously? It's because schools are still seen as the #1 venue of a person's development. However, there's more to learning than what can be found in school; here's how schools fail students, and how online spaces can make up for this ‚Äî especially those powered by web3.\n\t4. How do schools fail students?\n\t\t1. Packaging instruction with certification; linking instruction (not learning) to social role assignment\n\t\t\t1. Definitions\n\t\t\t\t1. Learning = acquiring new skill/insight \n\t\t\t\t2. Promotion = social role assignment, depends on others' opinions\n\t\t\t\t3. Instruction = choice of circumstances that facilitate learning\n\t\t\t2. With school, role assignment is linked to instruction, not learning\n\t\t\t\t1. Done through a curriculum of conditions a student must meet (i.e grades)\n\t\t\t\t2. Not reasonable: doesn't link relevant competencies to roles, but instead the process by which these are acquired\n\t\t\t\t3. Not liberating: those who benefit the most from instruction are those who fit social norms (e.g. affulent, neurotypical)\n\t\t\t3. Even alternative education models (e.g. bootcamps, accelerators) have the same faults\n\t\t\t\t1. need to complete specified criteria in order to \"graduate\"\n\t\t\t\t2. certification/brand as main value prop\n\t\t2. Assuming that most learning is the result of teaching\n\t\t\t1. Most of the time, people acquire their knowledge not from what's intentionally taught in school, but what they casually encounter outside it\n\t\t\t\t1. Learning happens as a by-product of some other activity (e.g. reading fluency comes from frequently reading for pleasure)\n\t\t\t2. Thus, the way people learn in schools isn't optimally designed for them\n\t\t\t\t1. Centralization/standardization\n\t\t\t\t\t1. the scale of a school is inversely correlated with its curriculum quality, especially creative support\n\t\t\t\t2. Not rewarding failure (best way to learn)\n\t\t\t\t\t1. students aren't able to grow as much due to lack of feedback\n\t\t\t\t\t2. afraid to explore\n\t\t\t\t3. Punitive assessments\n\t\t\t\t4. Rewarding rote work\n\t\t\t\t5. Atomizing subjects\n\t\t\t\t\t1. we learn about topics in silos, when in real life everything is integrated with each other\n\t5. How do alternatives such as virtual communities (especially those found in video games) serve them?\n\t\t1. Gives students an environment + tools where they can make discoveries themselves. \n\t\t\t1. Choose your own adventure: students can choose what they learn and how they learn it, instead of having to deal with the standardized way of learning things\n\t\t\t2. Provide space, time, and autonomy that schools do not\n\t\t2. Simulate reality + provide fast feedback loops\n\t\t\t1. more context = deeper understanding\n\t\t\t2. feedback mainly provided through real-time + async discussions with other members\n\t\t\t3. outputs/outcomes are tangible, directly related to the skills you learn \n\t\t\t\t1. E.G. github repos to code, pieces to art, etc\n\t\t\t4. digital data (e.g. social media metrics) can also help w/ feedback\n2. However, current systems still exploit or underserve these youth, just like in education\n\t1. Creators don't get to profit from their work, only platforms\n\t\t1. E.G. developers on Roblox find it hard to earn due to friction claiming profits + huge pay cut; creatives on social media are at the mercy of the algorithm\n\t2. IRL inequality is elevated thanks to digital divide\n\t\t1. those who can't rely on their own devices or connectivity won't be able to benefit from these spaces as much\n\t\t2. The premium experience reserved for those who can afford it; free members don't get these benefits unless they work for it\n\t\t\t\t\t1. E.G. memberships, virtual goods\n\t3. how can we tackle these problems?  let's get abstract\n3. **Finite -\u003e infinite games**\n\t1. Recap: I believe that the youth learn best in games (after all, we humans are Homo Ludens ‚Äî born players). But I don't necessarily just mean video games. I'm talking about the games we play in life. \n\t2. According to James Carse, there are two types of games: finite, which is played for the purpose of winning, and infinite, which is played for the purpose of continuing play. \n\t3. Thanks to society, most of us are playing finite games\n\t\t1. Players have to parade around their wealth and status\n\t\t2. Examples\n\t\t\t1. URL\n\t\t\t\t1.  reaching the top of leaderboards\n\t\t\t\t2.  getting reach: X followers, X likes, X shares, etc...\n\t\t\t2. IRL \n\t\t\t\t1. scoring the highest salary\n\t\t\t\t2. founding the next top startup  \n\t\t3. This has been encouraged by our existing educational environments\n\t\t\t1. Schools\n\t\t\t2. Even online platforms\n\t4. It's time for us to approach life as an infinite game\n\t\t1. The pursuit of excellence is a positive-sum game, with no finish line and no losers.\n\t\t2. Examples (according to [Kevin Kelly](https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Finite_vs._Infinite_Games))\n\t\t\t1. Evolution, life, mind, and the technium (accumulation of inventions that humans have created)\n\t\t\t2. The things in life we love most -- including life itself -- are infinite games.\n\t\t3. Instead of playing within boundaries, players play with the boundaries.\n\t\t\t1. May Li Khoe: instead of thinking of life as a series of checks, see it as a canvas which you can paint anyway you like. the status quo needs to change, and life is short. Thus, we need to [joyfully subvert the status quo](https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-1/joyful-subversion/) \n\t\t4. Creation + collaboration \u003e quantification + competition\n\t\t\t1. the online spaces I was a part of encouraged these values\n\t\t5. I believe that Web3 is the key to this shift\n4. **Why and how we could benefit from a Web3 powered future**\n\t1. In a Web3 powered future, education is an (infinite) game. What does this even mean? Or look like?\n\t\t1. What does web3-powered mean?\n\t\t\t1. [In web3, interactions in application/software are done through wallets](https://twitter.com/gaby_goldberg/status/1449002871706501133)\n\t\t\t2. In web3, users reclaim ownership of the internet due to decentralization\n\t\t\t\t1. Web2: \"Our consumption is driven by black-box algorithmic feeds, our work and property are only ours to borrow, and our value creation has been severely discredited. We don't own any of our digital properties, and we've been wired to accept it.\"\n\t\t\t\t2. Web3: now we can have control over...\n\t\t\t\t\t1. our work + property -\u003e NFTs\n\t\t\t\t\t2. platforms we participate in -\u003e  protocols, and the way they structure incentives\n\t\t2. Web3 is helping build the foundation of the Metaverse\n\t\t\t1. What is the Metaverse? \"the next iteration of the Internet that brings a sense of place and facilitates rich human connection.\"\n\t\t\t2. Already being done in Web2 through social [spatial software](https://darkblueheaven.com/spatialsoftware/) E.G. platforms like Gather and games like Roblox and Fornite\n\t\t3. How is education connected with this?\n\t\t\t1.  We're now entering an age of [embedded education](https://fakepixels.substack.com/p/fkpxls-special-volume-embedded-education), where learning happens everywhere instead of being limited to individual platforms\n\t\t\t\t1.  People learn through encounters they have through systems that may exist for non-educational purposes \n\t\t\t\t2.  E.G. Communities centered around products, teaching others how to make the most out of it through shared resources, discussions, etc -\u003e Figma, Notion\n\t\t\t\t3.  Thus, learning feels more natural\n\t\t\t2.  The Metaverse provides the perfect educational environment by...\n\t\t\t\t1.  immersive; simulates reality\n\t\t\t\t\t1.  shortened feedback loops from theory to practice: instead of reading about a topic, you experience it for yourself\n\t\t\t\t2.  brings together people wth diverse ideas and interests, without the barriers of physical location\n\t\t\t\t\t1.  more equitable and effective distribution of knowledge, skills, and information\n\t\t4. An educational metaverse would be the ultimate digital creative tool (according to [[Resource Notes/Computers and Creativity - Thesis]])\n\t\t\t1. To foster optimal human innovation, digital creative tools need to be interoperable, moldable, efficient, and community-driven.\n\t\t\t\t1. Interopability: the ability for different computers to connect and exchange information\n\t\t\t\t\t1. people's works are no longer confined to singular platforms/tools\n\t\t\t\t\t2. this allows for more collaboration and innovation\n\t\t\t\t2. Moldability: the ability for the user to tailor their software to better address the problem they are trying to solve\n\t\t\t\t\t1. customizability enables creativity\n\t\t\t\t3. Efficiency\n\t\t\t\t\t1. [The metaverse is infrastructure](https://venturebeat.com/2021/11/18/the-metaverse-is-infrastructure/)\n\t\t\t\t\t2. Makes real-time communication, managing presence, earning money, etc. easier\n\t\t\t\t4. Community-driven\n\t\t\t\t\t1. the people within in the metaverse is what brings it to life (i.e. content generation, community building)\n\t\t\t2. These tools hold potential as co-creators with human-beings. Tools of this type would lower the barrier to entry and make all users toolmakers and owners in an expanded definition of technological innovation.\n\t\t\t\t1. \"If the purpose of education is to inspire courage to expand our collective understanding of the world, the vision of Embedded Education is that every time we see something that inspires us, the path to actualizing this new-found dream starts right where we find it.\"\n\t2.

I remember spending hours telling stories online, whether it be through drawing fanart or roleplaying fantasies. It got to the point when my mother enforced a limit, worried that I was getting addicted to the computer. Now, I've found myself being gifted various opportunities (e.g. a prestigious scholarship, international freelance gigs, exciting Web3 projects) thanks to being well-versed in design, art, and writing: these are skills that I primarily gained not through sitting in school, but through having fun online.\n\nAround me, I see kids growing up the same way. At one end, there are developers learning programming through creation games like Roblox and Minecraft. At another, there are artists cultivating their craft in fandom communities on Twitter and Discord. I believe that these kids aren't just making their own futures, but the world's as well; investor Chris Dixon says that these [present-day hobbies will seed future industries](https://cdixon.org/2013/03/02/what-the-smartest-people-do-on-the-weekend-is-what-everyone-else-will-do-during-the-week-in-ten-years). Today's youth will be tomorrow's innovators.\n\nSo why aren't these hobbies taken seriously? It's because schools are still seen as the main venue of a person's development. However, there's more to learning than what can be found in school. In this essay, I'll be talking about how schools block students' growth, how existing online spaces make up for this, and how a giant game could become the best classroom for all of us.\n\n\n### Schools, spaces, and how students do in them\n\n#### How schools fail us\nOur educational institutions are designed to benefit the system, not the student.  They are influenced by what sociologist George Ritzer calls [\"McDonaldization\"](https://www.cpp.edu/~ddwills/courses/ant352/readings352/McDonaldization.htm), where principles of the fast food industry, driven by ‚Äúrationality,‚Äù dominate other sectors of society. It is expressed through four characteristics: efficiency, calculability, predictability, and control. Efficiency is seen in grouping students by age and replacing teachers with online lessons. Calculability is seen in ridiculous class sizes and high stakes testing. Predictability is seen in standardized curriculums and overreliance on lecture slides. Control is seen in automatic grading and using fear as incentive. \n\nTo summarize, here's a statement from [educator Shelley Wright](https://shelleywright.wordpress.com/2014/08/16/the-mcdonaldization-of-education-the-rise-of-slow/): \"McDonaldization attempts to wipe out any of the messiness or inefficiencies of learning. Instead, it attempts to reduce it to a commodity that can be packaged, marketed and sold. Rather than¬†cultivating a deep, holistic love of learning that touches every aspect of a student‚Äôs life, learning has been reduced to an assembly line. In reality, we‚Äôve imposed a mechanistic view of life onto how people learn, which is largely an organic process, and at a great cost.\"\n\n#### Virtual spaces: what they give and take\nSo how do virtual spaces ‚Äî like video games and online communities ‚Äî serve them? In [\"Video Games are the Future of Education\"](https://nabeelqu.co/education), Nabeel Qureshi gives multiple conclusions. \n\nOne, they give students the environment and tools to make discoveries themselves. This is because they provide space, time, and autonomy, which enables students to *choose* what they learn and how they learn it. Schools cannot provide this level of freedom. That's why kids remember what they encounter through engaging in these spaces, and forget what is taught to them in classes. They need to feel like it's just *play*.\n\nTwo, these spaces provide deep understanding of subjects. This is because they simulate reality and provide fast feedback loops, thanks to innovative features like immersive  environments and real-time communication. Outputs are tangible to students, and directly related to the skills they learn (e.g. Git repositories to code, published pieces to art); this applies to the response their works get as well (e.g. comments, metrics). Compare this to the typical school experience, which is quite shallow; when you're focused on memorizing information just to pass exams, you don't have the capacity to dive deep into a topic.\n\nIn short, virtual spaces are optimal learning environments because they provide additional context and creative freedom. Aside from this, they bring together people with diverse ideas and interests since there are no barriers of physical location. This allows for a more equitable and effective distribution of knowledge, skills, and information. All of this is empowering for students. However, these spaces are still capable of exploiting or underserving the youth, just like in traditional education. \n\nOne, real life inequality is elevated due to the digital divide. Those who can't rely on their own devices or connectivity won't be able to benefit from these spaces as much as people who can. Even worse, these spaces can also bar people financially. [In many MMO games, the premium experience (i.e. exclusive items, more user privileges) is reserved for those who can afford a membership](https://nancyzuo.substack.com/p/capitalism-in-virtual-worlds?r=8kghs\u0026utm_campaign=post\u0026utm_medium=web\u0026utm_source=). Free members can't get these unless they work for it (a.k.a. putting in more time for less pay). \n\nTwo, most creators don't get to benefit from their work, since majority of profit goes to the platforms. For example: [it is challenging for game developers to make money on Roblox, and the platform profits from people trying](https://www.wired.com/story/on-roblox-kids-learn-its-hard-to-earn-money-making-games/).  Developers only get a 25 percent cut of revenue, which is one third of the industry standard. If they want to take out their earnings, they must have a premium subscription ($5 a month) and earn a minimum of 100,000 Robux. This disincentivizes them from withdrawing. \n\nOverall, these conditions make it difficult for youth to get value not just from these spaces, but from the work they produce in them. It's why many parents/guardians aren't accepting of their kids' spending so much time online; they see it as a waste of time and money, and are unable to see how it could be beneficial long-term. Imagine how much creators would be enabled if these barriers to participation were removed.  How can we tackle these problems? It's time to get abstract.\n\n### Changing the game\nTo recap: I believe that the youth learn best when they feel like they're engaging in play; after all, we humans are [Homo Ludens](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/233221.Homo_Ludens) ‚Äî born players. But I don't necessarily just mean playing video games. I'm talking about the games we play in life.\n\nAccording to [James Carse](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/189989.Finite_and_Infinite_Games), there are two types of games: finite, which is played for the purpose of winning, and infinite, which is played for the purpose of continuing play. In our current society, most of us are playing finite games. Online, people aim for getting to the top of the leaderboards, or increasing reach: X amount of followers, likes, shares, etc. Offline, people desire to score the highest salary, or acquiring that prestigious degree.  Our existing educational environments encourage this way of thinking: not just schools, but also the online platforms we occupy (e.g. social media). This zero-sum mentality is not healthy to have long-term, especially for creators. No matter what or how much you make, it would never be enough. It's a recipe for burnout. \n\nWhat if we approached life as an infinite game? Success doesn't have to be stressful; in fact, [the pursuit of excellence can be a positive-sum game, with no finish line and no losers](https://www.weareworldquant.com/en/thought-leadership/playing-the-infinite-game/). According to writer [Kevin Kelly](https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Finite_vs._Infinite_Games), evolution, life, the mind, and the technium (the accumulation of all inventions that humans have ever created) are infinite games. The things in life we love most can be played the same way. How to start: instead of playing within boundaries, play with them. Technologist May-Li Khoe advises: \"...instead of thinking of life as a series of checks, see it as a canvas which you can paint anyway you like. the status quo needs to change, and life is short. Thus, we need to [joyfully subvert the status quo](https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-1/joyful-subversion/).\"\n\nWhat attracted me to MMORPG games and art communities were the values they encouraged: creation and collaboration. All people wanted to do was to keep making things and sharing them with others.  This wholesome culture changed with the [advent of platforms](https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-rise-fall-internet-art-communities); now, interactions are quantifiable and people are motivated by competition. If we want to make learning feel like play, we need to revive the culture of the early web, so that engaging online feels like an infinite game once again. And I believe that the key to this shift lies in making a whole new web.\n\n### A Whole New Web\nThe Internet is already the venue for the biggest infinite game ever;  investor Packy McCormick calls this the Great Online Game. Here, you play as yourself, and can rack up points, skills, and attributes that can be applied to your online and offline lives. If you continuously provide value without expecting anything in return, you will be rewarded well. This is best seen in social media, where you can make new friends, join exciting projects, and gain unimaginable wealth all just from sharing valuable ideas. Founders, influencers, technologists, and creatives have all found success by playing this game. The best part is that anyone can play this game; it's free to play, and levelling up is easier since your financial and social capital isn't tied tightly to real life credentials and connections.\n\nHow is this connected to learning? Playing the Great Online Game is the ultimate learning experience. Thanks to the Internet, we're now entering an age of [embedded education](https://fakepixels.substack.com/p/fkpxls-special-volume-embedded-education), where learning happens everywhere instead of being limited to individual platforms. This means that people learn through encounters they have in systems that may exist for non-educational purposes. For example, see communities centered around SaaS products like Figma and Notion; people teach others how to make the most out of products through shared resources and instructive tutorials.\n\nHowever, the current state of the web isn't designed for the new ways we're playing and learning. This will change; in the future, I believe that embedded education will take on the form of a Metaverse powered by Web3. Here, participants play an (infinite) game that rewards learning by *doing*. This meta-game would be composed of multiple sub-games, where learning takes many forms: going to events (e.g. lectures, workshops, panels), creating insightful content, taking on job experiences, and working on side projects. Thus, everyone is a lifelong student; why would you want to stop learning when there's so much opportunities for it?¬†\n\nBefore we can further illustrate this vision, we must first understand the underlying technologies. Why take the form of a Metaverse? What is Web3 anyways, and what does it even mean to be powered by it? To understand this, we need to start with Web1 and Web2. \n\n#### Web3\nWeb1 is all about consumption. Since the web was still in its early stages of development, most Internet users were readers of static web pages. It was difficult to produce your own web pages since it required both technical literacy and available time. Creativity was still alive though; because of technical constraints, [everything was *handmade*](https://stackingthebricks.com/how-blogs-broke-the-web/), from website navigation to image placement. No two home pages looked the same. \n\nThis changed with the arrival of Web2, which is all about creation. The invention of platforms (i.e. blogging and social media) made it easier to create content; now, anyone can be both consumer and creator. However, it can be argued that some creative power was sacrificed. One, individuality declined. Due to efficiency, users were working *inside* systems instead of *building* their own. Two, content is owned by companies operating platforms, not the users who generated all of it. This is the price they pay for using these platforms, along with their personal data. \n\nThankfully, Web3 is all about ownership. It's a new version of the Internet where [interactions in applications/software are facilitated through wallets ‚Äî which serve as both verified identities and funding sources](https://twitter.com/gaby_goldberg/status/1449002871706501133).  This mechanic decentralizes the web, empowering users to own their content, data, and assets. \n\nWallets mainly handle cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum; these serve as in-game money for the Great Online Game, rewarding participation. You can gain tokens from supporting your favorite projects/people early (link to ENS airdrop?), along with exchanging value directly (e.g. crowdfunding an essay in ETH). You can also get rewarded for learning with the Learn to Earn (L2E) model, which pays people for performing tasks and learning skills.\n(Web3, Crypto, and Learning post). For example: on Rabbithole, you can earn crypto by learning about Web3. \n\nAnother type of token that can be earned is a Non-Fungible Token (NFT): cryptographic tokens that prove authenticity, ownership, and scarcity of digital assets. NFTs can be applied to any type of digital media: visuals, text, and audio. Right now, they're best known for being digital artworks, but they have so many use cases: event tickets, advertisements, domains and more. Imagine what they could do for learning!\n\nOverall, Web3 brings the Internet closer to people than ever before. Interactions feel more concrete because digital assets now have physical characteristics; cryptocurrencies act like cash, and NFTs act like real life items. However, due to its complexity, Web3 is in need of an interface that can bring it to its fullest potential. Enter the Metaverse.\n\n\n#### The Metaverse\nThe Metaverse can be generally defined as an Internet that brings a sense of place and facilitates rich human connection. We are already living in the early stages of the Metaverse. Encouraged by the pandemic, most of our lives have shifted online: working, talking, shopping, and more; our physical spaces have been replaced by [spatial software](https://darkblueheaven.com/spatialsoftware/) such as games like Fortnite and platforms like Gather. However, our digital experience is currently scattered across various spaces, making us feel disconnected. Web3 can be the framework that weaves these together into one big cohesive universe. As the ultimate virtual space, the ideal Metaverse would be the perfect environment for embedding education. \n\nThis Metaverse would also be the ultimate digital creative tool. In [\"Computers and Creativity\"](https://www.mollymielke.com/cc), designer Molly Mielke discusses how digital creative tools can potentially be co-creators with human beings; they foster innovation by lowering the barrier to entry, making all users toolmakers and owners. In order to do this, the tools need to be interoperable, moldable, efficient, and community-driven: all traits that an ideal Metaverse has. Here's how the Metaverse can be developed to its fullest potential, especially for education.\n\n##### Standardization\nOur online experience is scattered because the current state of the Internet is siloed. Since it's under the control of a few Big Tech companies, the websites users interact with lack connections with one another. This forces users to make several accounts since activities are restricted to single platforms only; for example, this can be seen in the need for multiple social media accounts. Confining one's activity to the platform it was done on hinders collaboration and limits creativity.\n\nA Web3-powered Metaverse is built for interopability. What this means is that users aren't restricted to a single platform. Thanks to  wallets, everyone has their own inventory (John Palmer); they can bring their data, content, and assets with them wherever they go. Being able to move these into different platforms increases their value, and allows for more collaboration and innovation between people. However, interoperability is only possible through standardization, which ensures compatibility. A great example of this is the open-source movement. Extensive documentation and open liceensing enables a remixing culture where developers are always building upon each other's creations. Even large Big Tech companies have benefitted from this, since their products are built with the help of open-source code.\n\nStandardization can also be seen in Web3, whose first target audience was developers. For example, the ERC-20 token standard is used for outlining specifications that ensure that tokens function optimally on the Ethereum blockchain (e.g. the total supply, how to transfer tokens, and how transactions are approved). Over 1,000 assets follow this standard, making it one of the core pillars of the blockchain ecosystem (Gemini cryptopedia). The same is being done for the Metaverse. Big Tech companies are sharing their outputs to help grow the ecosystem (e.g. Pixar open sourced the Universal Scene Description file format to help developers create interchangeable 3D data) (Matthew Ball - Interchange, Tools, and Standards). The Open Metaverse Interopability Group is also designing and promoting protocols for integral features like identity, social graphs, inventory, etc.\n\nTo summarize, Mielke writes that standardization would fundamentally improve digital creative tools by \"...allowing in more collaborators, making space for greater tooling innovation, and expanding a project's creative constraints beyond any one tool itself.\" A Web3-powered Metaverse cannot be built alone; standardization brings both the giant manpower and diverse perspectives needed to bring it to life. Here are some ideas of what standardization can do for an educational metaverse:\n+ Every player has their own profile. This acts as a dynamic resume, where everything you learn and make is automatically shown on-chain. This also acts as a passport, showing your online travels: consuming, curating, publishing, and investing. \n+ Everytime you go to an educational experience, you get a badge that is included in your profile. This is made possible through Proof of Attendance Protocols (POAPs), NFTs that serve as reliable records of life experiences. \n+ Tokens will be used as incentives for learning. Token holders can exchange their tokens for fiat, compensating students/teachers/creators, and for making decisions regarding how the group behind the experience operates.\n+ Educational materials (i.e. syllabi, playbooks, journals) will be open-sourced. The culture of remixing will persist; these materials will always be open to edits, comments, and updates from the general public. \n+ In order to tackle problems of information overload and quality control, curators for these materials will be needed more than ever. Profiles will be used to determine if a person has enough experience to become a curator for a certain topic.\n\n##### Moldability\nNowadays, in an era of mass-produced software, the way we use most digital tools are dictated by the companies who created them. However, everyone is unique in their thought process. If the tools we use are extensions of ourselves, being forced to adapt to the tool being used is limiting. Ideally, the tools we hse should fit our workflows, and not the other way around (Linus Lee). Thus, the ability for users to tailor their tools to their needs is key for supporting creativity.\n\nOwnership in Web3 enables people's creativity. Just like with video games, people customize their digital presence through the things they acquire: profile pictures, virtual clothing, ENS domains, and more. The Metaverse gives these digital assets physical characteristics, making them feel more real for people. A virtual land can be a 3D canvas that holds infinite possibilities; it can be an art gallery (Cyber), a theme park (The Sandbox), a shopping district (Republic Realm)...anything you want it to be. Overall, a Web3-powered Metaverse is not just a digital creative tool -- it is powerful enough to be a medium for creative expression.\n\nAnd self-expression is the path to levelling up online. McCormick writes: \"... the more you signal who you are and what you care about, the more you open yourself up to new possibilties.\" (The Great Online Game) These new possibilities are opportunities (e.g. partnerships, offers, projects) that come because people are attracted to your presence.\n\nThe success of digital tools can also be attributed to passionate communities behind them. Web3 and the Metaverse are already cool technologies on their own, but they're brought to life through the people using them. For instance, see (toolmakers): pioneering users that share their creations and advocate for a tool's promise; they're vital for empowering average users, since the toolmakers' creations inspire average users to mold the tool themselves. Content creators and community builders are good examples of this.\n\nWeb3 has especially grown because of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs): mission-driven groups that coordinate through blockchain-enforced rules (Linda Xie). They serve as core infrastructure for the (Great Online Game) by making it easier to connect and collaborate with others online; these same processes would take even longer offline. The tools they use are also made for moldability. Outside of Web3 apps, the tools they prefer the most are the ones that are most customizable, like Discord and Notion. Since DAOs are distributed remotely, many use Metaverse platforms like Gather for cultivating connections. Communities like DAOs that help these tools further innovate themselves.\n\nTo summarize, tools like a Web3-powered Metaverse can facilitate creativity by allowing customization and being supported by a collaborative community. Here are some ideas of what moldability can do for an educational metaverse:\n+ The overall experience for players should feel like a Choose Your Own Adventure. Players customize their character by choosing what they want to acquire, from learned skills to supported works. This may lead to the emergence of different classes; the profile of an artist will look different from a community builder.\n+ Teachers will become designers. The learning experience they'll be designing will involve not just content and delivery, but also  environment (where are students learning?) and mechanics (what systems/rules do they have to follow?). \n+ Classrooms as we know them today will be greatly transformed in order to fit a variety of learning styles. (Link to Azlen Ezla designs) \n+ Depending on the teacher, tokens can represent almost anything that can be tracked with a smart contract: reputation on a social platform, skills of a video game character, etc.\n+ Learning DAOs will be the new schools. Plug KERNEL by Gitcoin, Crypto Culture Society, and Ethernaut DAO\n+ DAOs can also act like guilds, onboarding students and helping them level up in this game. There's a niche for every type of person: artists, developers, gamers, investors, etc.\n\n##### Abstraction\nThaks to Web2 consumer platforms, it's easier for everyone to create and share content online. However, when it comes to technical disciplines like programming, the creative process is still complex. The abstract nature of code forces developers to play computer in their head, spending more energy on visualizing the problem instead of working on it themselves (The Coming Software Apocalypse). This barrier is what prevents people from learning technical skills -- which are key if one wishes to mold their own part of the Internet. \n\nIn order for people to make use of a tool's moldability, it must be abstracted enough to be accessible. This usually means that its interface must be controlled visually (WYSIWYG) and require no technical knowledge. Thankfully, canvas-based creative tools like interface design software and no-code builders have made it easier to create on the web. Abstraction can also help improve inefficient parts of the creative process. An efficient tool minimizes repetitive work, allowing users to focus on being creative; this is done by simplifying repetitive workflows and accomodating logic.\n\nWeb3 enables creativity by making collaborating or coordinating with others much more efficient. This is done through smart contracts, self-executing contracts that have their terms written in code (Investopedia). DAOs are powered by such contracts, which define the group's rules and hold their treasury; this reduces possibility of conflict that may obstruct the DAO's desired outcomes. Offering predefined elements is another way to simplify repetitive workflows. In Web3, this is done through composability: the ability of system components to connect to each other, just like Lego pieces (Aragon). The open-source nature of most Web3 projects helps reduce set-up time for other builders, which increases the rate of experimentation and innovation.\n\nHowever, Web3 is still too complex and confusing for most users. In order to achieve mass adoption, it will need a paradigm-shifting interface. McCormick writes that it will need to (The Interface Phase) \"...add order to the...chaos of decentralization, and give obvious and meaningful utility to digital assets...it will need to...hide complexity beneath the surface, and deliver clean experiences. It will need to create a canvas for both developers and users themselves to create the next million new apps.\"\n\nAs an interface, the Metaverse will be able to do all of this. Its visual nature will reduce friction in Web3 user experience by making abstract concepts feel more concrete. The Metaverse is also an efficient tool itself since [it's considered as infrastructure](https://venturebeat.com/2021/11/18/the-metaverse-is-infrastructure/), making actions like communicating real-time, managing presence, and earning money easier. For sure, creation will become easier as well; the beginnings of this are already being seen in video games.\n\nTo summarize, abstraction makes tools fully responsible for executing tedious tasks, which allows people to fully focus on the act of creation. If the Metaverse gives form to Web3, more people will be enabled to make use of this powerful technology. This would help them gain ownership over the web in their own ways. Here are some ideas of what abstraction can do for an educational metaverse:\n+ Being online should feel as natural as real life. Imagine an immersive 3D world where 2D interfaces are seamlessly integrated. My pegs for this are Google Glass (clean, responsive, and practical HUD interface design) and Somnium Space (blockchain-based multiverse designed for virtual reality).\n+ No matter what you aim to create, there will be a template for it. This will come from all the open-source works created by others. For example, the Metaverse can come with starting environments for classrooms, social mixers, conferences, etc.\n+ The data your profile contains can provide suggestions for your learning journey. You can get recommended skills you could learn, quests/experiences you could take on, people you would vibe with, etc.\n+ Learning will primarily be done through a hands-on approach. Khan Academy already teaches programming like this; in exercises, the left-hand side contains the code while the right-hand side contains the simulation of it. How can this be applied to other subjects? Imagine taking tours back in time for history, governing hypothetical countries for politics, and more.\n\n\nOverall, the Metaverse makes creating easier for all, which in turn aids the process of learning. Stated well by [investor Tina He](https://fakepixels.substack.com/p/fkpxls-special-volume-embedded-education): \"If the purpose of education is to inspire courage to expand our collective understanding of the world, the vision of Embedded Education is that every time we see something that inspires us, the path to actualizing this new-found dream starts right where we find it.\" Hopefully, this ease motivates people to learn not because they want to win something, but instead because they truly enjoy it.\n\n### We're ready for this future\nThe youth are already primed for this future; being immersed in digital worlds helps us transition to virtual systems like Web3. Founder Brian Cho discusses the youth's advantages. \n\n#### (Value) creation/contribution\nConcepts like wallets, tokens, and NFTs are intuitive for the youth to understand because of a childhood spent dealing with virtual currencies and goods. They are also already used to working for rewards online, whether it be through grinding for XP or commenting for reputation. This applies to learning too; they are willing to put up with a steep learning curve  just to have fun. \n\n#### Community\nMany youths were active participants of gaming guilds and fan forums, so the way DAOs operate is natural for them. For example, take community-led governance. Kids who run Minecraft servers are always thinking about the impact the design of their server has on their players (e.g. making their world free-for-all, punishing those who break the rules, using plugins to prevent damage). At the same time, they're also learning about soft skills like compromising with others, balancing demands and resolving conflict.\n \n#### Culture\nJust like in our current Internet, web3 identities revolve around merit; what you do online is more important than who you are offline. Thus, being anonymous/psuedonymous is not off-putting at all. The way people communicate is affected too. Web2 memes and language (e.g. gamer lingo like gg, ggwp, glhf) has been a huge influence on Web3 memes and language (e.g. gm, gn, wagmi). All of this helps cultivate a sense of connection with strangers all across the globe.\n\n### How can we create it?\n#### Public good\nIf we want learning in the future to be an infinite game, we must ensure that this Metaverse will be a public good. This means it must have the following characteristics. One, it has to be non-rivalrous, which means that it's accessible to everyone; a person's use of the good does not impact its availability to others. Two, it has to be non-excludable, which means that it should be impossible to exclude anybody from using the good.\n\nOur current education system does not fulfill these criteria. Both traditional schools and alternative learning experiences (i.e. fellowships and bootcamps) are inherently rivalrous because the amount of students is inversely correlated with the quality of interactions. Factors like cost, time, and literacy can also exclude others from getting educated.\n\nAn open Metaverse would make education more accessible. Video games like Minecraft and Fortnite have served as engaging educational platforms, teaching thousands of kids all over the world; imagine all the possibilities if these games worked together. However, if companies like Meta are allowed to take control of this space, the Metaverse will become closed. The extractive systems of web2 that value profits over people would be revived -- hurting young creators all over again. (Rabbithole thread)\n\n#### Game design\nThis Metaverse must also be intentionally designed, just like games too. However, we must be wary of gamification; it usually becomes pointsification, which is all about external motivation. Examples of this are mechanics like points, badges, and leaderboards: signifiers of finite games. Educator Ana Lorena Fabrega says that games are at their best when people play them out of genuine interest. Same should apply to this Metaverse; people should be playing not because they want to be rewarded, but because they simply enjoy it. In order to design a game like this, Fabrega states the need for the following criteria. \n\nFirst, **a goal/specific outcome that provides players with a sense of purpose.** The overarching goal for this Metaverse would be providing value; whatever you learn should be used to help other people learn too. This goal could be interpreted in various ways by DAOs, which could write their own manifestos. What would a Sustainable Development Goals look like in this new digital realm?\n\nNext, **rules that place limitations on how players can achieve their goal.** Examples of rules could be game mechanics and Codes of Conduct. These ensure that players have an enjoyable experience. Without rules, players may be confused on what to do, take shortcuts that defeat the game's purpose, or offend fellow players.\n\nThen, **a feedback system that tells players how close they are to achieving their goal.** Feedback is mainly sourced from fellow players. From an audience's responses, one is able to tell from their  actions what's working and what's not. They must also be careful of favoring quantifiable metrics; views and likes may not compare to genuine conversations.\n\nFinally, **voluntary participation.** It's not a game if people don't know that they're playing. Consent isn't just agreeing to play, but also having full knowledge of the game. This can be done through web3 wallet transactions, which must always be signed before being processed. The problem is conveying all necessary information (i.e. objectives, rules) clearly without becoming an typical Terms and Conditions.\n\nI see these criteria being applied to both the sub-games that serve as learning opportunities (e.g. joining hackathons) and the meta-game itself a.k.a. the Metaverse. \n\n#### Challenges\nThe main problem barring the creation of this Metaverse concerns technology: the Internet's current infrastructure is not developed enough to support this grand vision. Both Web3 and Metaverse (i.e. AR, XR, VR) technologies are still in their early stages, so only a privileged few can benefit from using them. But before the Metaverse can be introduced to all, there are big social and economic challenges that need to be tackled. \n\nOne, personal privacy. Do we really want to make everything we learn and make visible on the blockchain? Both \"successes\" and \"failures\" would be shown (i.e. mastering the Solidity language v.s. initiating an unprofitable NFT project). How can we encourage failure and growth without it being detrimental to one's prospects? If we aren't careful, this may lead to a personal branding similar to Linkedin culture, only where people are afraid of getting involved with projects that may hurt their resume.\n\nTwo, marketplace competition. In the perspective of most companies (especially Big Tech), it's more beneficial to create their own walled gardens versus collaborating with others. This is what leads them to build proprietary products from open source software and steal features from one another (e.g. Snapchat's stories). How can we incentivize working together in order to build an interopable Metaverse? I find hope in the culture of Web3, where collaboration is the norm; there are always projects seeking collaborators and DAOs open for partnerships.\n\nThree, misinformation. Many people are skeptical or against Web3 due to concerns like hyperfinancialization and environmental impact. It doesn't help that the language of Web3 isn't beginner-friendly, or that the space is filled with scammers. We must tackle these concerns so that more people (not just the highly privileged) can feel ready enough to become participants. \n\n#### Conclusion\nThe ways we're learning and creating are no longer serving us; both traditional schools and Web2 platforms take more value from people instead of giving it to them. A better future lies in game-like technologies like Web3 and the Metaverse, which the youth caught on to first because of a childhood spent immersed in virtual spaces. These same youth will be the innovators who'll be making this future a reality.\n\nHowever, this is only possible because virtual spaces (i.e. games, communities) were open to these youth, being both accessible and engaging. We need to ensure that a Web3-powered Metaverse will be the same. If it's closed off to all but a select few, we'd be closing off potential creators who hold new possibilities for human innovation.\n\nIf life is a game, we all want to level up. We choose the type of game we want to play. Do you want to upgrade only yourself, or also help upgrade our world? Your success is up to you.\n\n## Draft 2\n### A Whole New Web\n#### Welcome to the Metaverse\n- we are now living in a metaverse paragraph\n- back with web3? (no need to describe in detail; can be expounded in later sections)\n- the ultimate digital creative tool\n\nhttps://ed3.mirror.xyz/0U3QG8-4K6CD_ltU6SJyKN3-uBD3x6nEFs-YeShzYmk\ngood intro to ed3\n\u003e **Web3 refers to the decentralized ecosystem of technology to support the next generation of virtual engagement.**\n\n\u003e **Web3 enables individual users to make decisions about their online activity without having to compromise utility**.\n\n\u003e **In ed3, learners own their education - validating their knowledge with decentralized technology in contrast to previous models.**\n\n\u003e -   Ed1 was knowledge transfer provided by accredited institutions, such as universities and high schools\n\u003e - Ed2 was centralized platforms distributing education, such as Udemy, Skillshare, and Outschool\n\u003e - Ed3 is individuals gathering skills from a variety of sources and validating that knowledge in their own wallet.\n\n#### Standardization\nWhat if...**[every player could have their own profile?](https://www.rushil2cents.com/the-internet-as-your-resume/)** Right now, we have multiple social media accounts because the applications we use aren't connected to one another; this confines one's activity to the platform it was done on. A Web3-powered Metaverse is built for interoperability, freeing users from being restricted to platforms. Thanks to¬†wallets, [everyone can have their own inventory](https://darkblueheaven.com/newinternetlogic), enabling them to bring their data, content, and assets with them wherever they go. These inventories are the basis of profiles. They can act as dynamic resumes/passports, where everything you learn and make is automatically shown on-chain. \n\nFor instance, you could get a badge for every educational experience you've attended. This is made possible through [Proof of Attendance Protocols (POAPs)](https://poap.xyz/), NFTs that serve as reliable records of life experiences. Experiments like [Free Learn](https://kernel.community/en/blog/community/free-learn/) and [LABEL](https://beincrypto.com/learn/label-blockchain-mooc/) have been exploring this. Imagine also earning tokens for learning. As a token holder, you'd be able to exchange your tokens for fiat, compensate students/teachers/creators, and make decisions regarding how the group behind the experience operates. For instance, learners in [Crypto, Culture, \u0026 Society](https://ccsdao.xyz) (liberal arts education for crypto) use their tokens for voting on the syllabus, scholarships, guests, etc.\n\nWhat if...**we could co-create our classrooms?** Interoperability is only possible through standardization, which ensures compatibility. The open-source movement does this well; extensive documentation and open licensing enables a remixing culture where developers are always building upon each other's creations. Standards are already being created for our potential learning environment. For example, over 1,000 assets in the Ethereum ecosystem follow the ERC-20 token standard; meanwhile, the Metaverse ecosystem is being built by both Big Tech companies and volunteer groups (e.g. [Pixar open sourcing the Universal Scene Description file format](https://www.matthewball.vc/all/interchangemetaverse); [The Open Metaverse Interoperability Group](https://omigroup.org/home/) designing protocols for integral features like identity, social graphs, inventory, etc.).\n\nImagine also collaboratively creating our curricula. Educational materials (i.e. syllabi, playbooks, journals) would be open-sourced. The culture of remixing will still persist; these materials will always be open to edits, comments, and updates from the general public. In order to tackle problems of information overload and quality control, curators for these materials will be needed more than ever. Profiles can be used to determine if a person has enough experience to become a curator for a certain topic.\n\nTo summarize, Mielke writes that standardization would fundamentally improve digital creative tools by [\"...allowing in more collaborators, making space for greater tooling innovation, and expanding a project's creative constraints beyond any one tool itself.\"](https://www.mollymielke.com/cc#stan) A Web3-powered Metaverse cannot be built alone; standardization brings both the giant manpower and diverse perspectives needed to bring it to life.\n\n#### Moldability\nWhat if...**learning was like a Choose Your Own Adventure?** Players could customize their character by choosing what they want to acquire, from learned skills to supported works. This may lead to the emergence of different classes; the profile of an artist will look different from a community builder. Self-expression is the path to levelling up online; McCormick writes: [\"... the more you signal who you are and what you care about, the more you open yourself up to new possibilities.\"](https://www.notboring.co/p/the-great-online-game)  These new possibilities are opportunities (e.g. partnerships, offers, projects) that come because people are attracted to your presence.\n\nIf we could design our own profiles, what if **we could also design our learning experience?** Nowadays, in an era of mass-produced software, our workflows are dictated by the tools we use. However, everyone is unique in their thought process. A Web3-powered Metaverse acknowledges this by enabling us [to own the ways we learn and create.](https://thesephist.com/posts/tools/) We're already used to customizing our digital presence, whether it's through the profile pictures we use or the personal websites we make. So why can't we have this for our digital experiences as well? \n\nIt's difficult to learn how to fully customize our experiences without being exposed to how others mold them. Enter [toolmakers](https://www.mollymielke.com/cc#mold): pioneering users that share their creations and advocate for a tool's promise. They're vital for empowering average users, since the toolmakers' creations inspire average users to mold the tool themselves. Content creators and community builders are good examples of this; in their own way, they're also teachers, bringing the best out of their audiences.\n\nThus, the teachers of the future will be full-fledged designers. They'll be designing not just content and delivery, but also¬†environment (where are students learning?) and mechanics (what systems/rules do they have to follow?). In the Metaverse, the forms a classroom can take are endless: [an art gallery](https://oncyber.io/), [a theme park](https://www.animocabrands.com/the-sandbox-partners-with-atari), [a shopping district](https://www.republicrealm.com/metajuku)...anything you want it to be. With more people from diverse backgrounds becoming teachers, classrooms will be greatly transformed in order to fit a variety of learning styles. See [Azlen Elza's classroom design explorations.](https://twitter.com/azlenelza/status/1457346877163143170) Teachers could also incorporate tokens into the learning experience; these can track almost anything that can be tracked with a smart contract (e.g. reputation on a social platform, skills of a video game character). Imagine all the possible ways learning could happen.\n\nWhat if...**learning was like a multiplayer game?** As seen with toolmakers, passionate communities are vital to the learning experiences of game \u0026 SaaS platforms; imagine Minecraft without its creative builders or Notion without its productivity nerds. Navigating your own education is difficult without having guides and peers supporting you. In a Web3-powered Metaverse, communities would come in the form of DAOs, or decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs): mission-driven groups that coordinate through blockchain-enforced rules (Linda Xie). [This structure enables learners and educators alike to collaboratively steward their education](https://twitter.com/KatwellKat/status/1490428103612518400).\n\nDAOs could act as guilds, onboarding newbies and helping them level up in this game. A niche exists for every type of person: artists, developers, gamers, investors, etc., and students could choose what best suits their adventure. Membership is signified with an NFT on their profile, which in turn gives them access to the guild's content and community. Students grow by acquiring experience points and tokens through completing learning bounties or sharing knowledge with others.\n\nOverall, a Web3-powered Metaverse is not just a digital creative tool -- it is powerful enough to be a *medium* for creative expression. This is because of customization and the support of collaborative communities. This educational platform cannot serve everyone if it cannot adapt to anyone's needs.\n#### Abstraction\nWhat if...**learning was truly hands-on?** In order to enable more people's creativity online, the technical work required of them must be abstracted. Enaging with technology is still too complex and confusing because it still requires a ton of cognitive effort, whether you're an everyday user or an experienced developer. This can be seen in learning Web3, where transactions must be understood before being approved, and programming, where [the problem must be visualized before working on it.](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/09/saving-the-world-from-code/540393/) As the most immersive learning environment, a Web3-powered Metaverse would take on the burden of comprehension by making abstract concepts feel more concrete, leaving learners to focus on critical thinking. At the same time, it would encourage them to have fun, making the steep learning curve less excruciating. \n\nThis is why games are the new classrooms. For instance, see \"programming by demonstration\". Khan Academy already teaches like this; in their exercises, the left-hand side contains the code while the right-hand side contains the simulation of it. The Metaverse would upgrade this simulation, turning outputs on a screen to a whole world you can interact with, like Minecraft. [It encourages computational thinking in kids through their advanced elements, like redstone and command blocks.](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/17/magazine/the-minecraft-generation.html) This can also be done for investing in crypto and NFTs. Why read instructional modules when you can experience trading instead? You can do this in [Curious Addy's Trading Club](https://www.curiousaddys.com/), where players can simulate trading cryptocurrencies and NFTs risk-free. Imagine learning other subjects through games too!\n\nWhat if...**you didn't have to start from scratch?** Abstraction also improves inefficient parts of the creative process by simplifying repetitive workflows and accommodating logic. Offering predefined elements is one way to increase efficiency. This is done in Web3 through [composability](https://blog.aragon.org/what-is-composability/): the ability of system components to connect to each other, just like Lego pieces; the open-source nature of most projects helps reduce set-up time for other builders, increasing the rate of experimentation and innovation.\n\nWhen put together, building blocks form foundational structures. A Web3-powered Metaverse serves as an [infrastructure](https://venturebeat.com/2021/11/18/the-metaverse-is-infrastructure/), making learning and creating more efficient. Here, teachers could find a template for any learning  experience they want to create; imagine starting environments for classrooms, social mixers, conferences, etc. These would come from open-source works provided by other creators. This also applies to designing your own learning journey. The data your profile contains can recommend skills you could learn, quests/experiences you could take on, people you would vibe with, etc.\n\nAside from learning and creating, the application process must also be improved; this is currently broken for both schools and workplaces, which are places for learning. Profiles, interviews, and references aren't indicative of one's performance; they also take a lot of effort, whether you're the applicant or the evaluator. One startup tackling this problem is [Station](https://station.express/), which describes itself as building \"on-chain infrastructure for onboarding \u0026 coordinating contributors of the future.\"  DAOs have their own terminals, which feature all their initiatives; each initiative has information on required commitment, reward(s) for contribution, recommended skills, etc. After someone applies to an initiative, they can get endorsed by existing contributors. \n\nTo summarize, abstraction makes tools fully responsible for executing tedious tasks, which allows people to fully focus on learning and creating. If the Metaverse gives form to Web3, more people will be enabled to make use of this powerful technology. This would help them gain ownership over the web in their own ways.\n\n\n-  everyday magic\n\t- good software creates agency through malleable systems, playful environments, fast feedback loops, and data interopability\n\t\t- malleable systems (abstraction?)\n\t\t\t- providing building blocks\n\t\t\t- more approachable than forcing ppl into rigid flows\n\t\t\t- enables moldability\n\t\t- playful environments (moldability?)\n\t\t\t- learning curve is steep, so it must be fun instead of excruciating\n\t\t\t- solve boring utilitarian needs by embedding fun into the core experience, rewarding experimentation and learning through doing.\n\t\t- fast feedback loops (abstractionl)\n\t\t\t- delayd can derail creative desire\n\t\t\t- requirements: responsive to updating on changes and streamlining complexty\n\t\t\t- E.G. no-code\n\t\t- interoperability (standradization)\n\t\t\t- Interoperability refers to the ability to transfer data between apps seamlessly. Practically, this means having easy and comprehensive flows for importing and exporting data into and out of other apps.\n\t\t\t- In a world of fully interoperable software, new apps can have immediate value because individuals can bring data in from existing apps. This immediate access eliminates the moat that incumbent software has over new creations‚Äîmultiplying the effectiveness of individual agency by giving full control over produced data.\n\t- In the context of software, agency comes down to whether someone feels _in control_ and _powerful_ when they‚Äôre using a piece of software, rather than coerced and scared. It‚Äôs the difference between wanting to continue exploring rather than dreading continued use.\n\t- Agency shifts the balance of power‚Äîfrom corporations and startups to everyday communities and neighbors. In the ideal world, individuals would not only have the power to reject agency-deficient and agency-depriving environments, like those with [dark design patterns](https://medium.com/thrive-global/how-technology-hijacks-peoples-minds-from-a-magician-and-google-s-design-ethicist-56d62ef5edf3), misaligned profit models, and pyramid scheme-esque incentives; they will also be responsible for using that power towards a future they want to see.\n\n## Draft 3\n### Environments and how they enable students\nOur learning is often defined by our environment: [the invisible hand that shapes our behavior](https://jamesclear.com/power-of-environment).  In line with this, the best learning environments are **[enabling environments](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z3DaBP4vN1dutjUgrk3jbEeNxScccvDCxDgXe)**; according to researcher Andy Matuschak, these **significantly expand its participants‚Äô capacity to do things they find meaningful and important.** To do this, the activities they provide must directly serve an intrinsically meaningful purpose. When participants are fuelled by an intense personal connection to a subject, they'll naturally partake in effortful engagement, which naturally leads to deep understanding. These activities must also focus on action. Compare reading about a sport versus actually playing the sport; the more isolated participants are from the action, the less likely they are to be enabled by their environment. Overall, an enabling environment enables its participants by creating opportunities for personal growth and highlighting bridges to opportunities for action based on that growth.\n\nSchools aspire to do this, but often fall short; this is because their primary purpose is knowledge/skill development, which isn't intrinsically meaningful on its own. Because of this, students depend on teachers not only for expertise but also for purpose. This dependence hinders the cultivation of an intense personal connection, making it less likely for the students to develop a deep understanding of a subject. Meanwhile, great software environments are better enabling environments for youth because they empower them in pursuing their passions (e.g. expanding range of artistic expression, distributing to millions with zero marginal cost). \n\nMatuschak clarifies that [most games aren't enabling environments](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z6DCZK1JtHU3waXWTk5UbNt3kXU4WRT9EwNND). Even if they're effective at developing knowledge/skills, they rarely expand players' capacity in doing things they find meaningful and important, since the primary purpose of most games is to create an aesthetic/emotional experience. However, there are a few that still count; Minecraft's creative mode enables serious creative expression, while the structured social environments of massively-multiplayer online games enable interpersonal connection and community formation. These types of games, alongside great software environments, are the new schools of today's youth.\n\n\n\n### The Great Online Game\nI believe that the youth learn best when they feel like they're engaging in play; after all, we humans are [Homo Ludens](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/233221.Homo_Ludens) ‚Äî born players. But I don't necessarily just mean playing video games. I'm talking about the games we play in life. According to [writer James Carse](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/189989.Finite_and_Infinite_Games), there are two types of games: finite, which is played for the purpose of winning, and infinite, which is played for the purpose of continuing play. Even if infinite games are best for learning, most of our educational environments are designed as finite games. Offline, we're optimizing for name-brand schools and 4.0 GPAs; online, we're grinding for topping leaderboards and increasing our reach. What if we approached education as an infinite game? \n\nThe Internet already serves as the venue for the biggest infinite game ever: [The Great Online Game](https://www.notboring.co/p/the-great-online-game). Coined by investor Packy McCormick, this is a game where you play as yourself, racking up points, skills, and attributes that can be applied to your online and offline lives. Levelling up here is simple: the more you provide value (without expecting anything in return), the more you'll be rewarded. The best part is that anyone can play this game; it's nearly free to play, and leveling up is easier since your financial and social capital isn't tightly tied to real life credentials and connections. Playing this game is the ultimate way to experience learning by doing.\n\nPeople have always been learning this way, but thanks to the Internet, this approach has been given the spotlight it deserves. We've arrived at an age of [embedded education](https://fakepixels.substack.com/p/fkpxls-special-volume-embedded-education), where learning happens everywhere instead of being limited to individual platforms. Now, people are learning through encounters they have in systems that may have been created for non-educational purposes. On one hand, it looks like teenage girls learning about  [HTML/CSS](https://sea.mashable.com/life/19346/from-tumblr-girl-to-engineer-how-the-platform-inspired-a-generation-of-women-to-code) and [feminism](https://magdalene.co/story/feminism-on-tumblr-third-wave-feminism-in-action) on Tumblr; on the other, it looks like productivity nerds creating resources and tutorials for Notion. \n\nHowever, the current state of the web isn't designed for the new ways we're learning. This must change; in the future, **I believe that the future of education will look like an infinite game that rewards learning by doing.** This meta-game might be composed of multiple sub-games, where learning takes many forms: going to events (e.g. lectures, workshops, panels), creating insightful content, taking on job experiences, and working on side projects. Thus, everyone becomes a lifelong student; why would you want to stop learning when there are so many opportunities for it?\n\n**I believe that a Metaverse powered by Web3 has the potential to bring this vision to life**; however, if we're not careful, it can easily fall into the same traps of modern education. In this essay, I'll be illustrating what this vision looks like, and how we can design this intentionally.\n\n### A Whole New Web\nThis future is defined by freedom; people would be free to choose what they learn and how they learn it. This may only be achievable on an [open web](https://www.yearofopen.org/november-open-perspective-what-is-open-web/what-is-the-open-web-and-why-is-it-important-submitted-by-mark-surman-executive-director-of-the-mozilla-foundation/): one that is by and for all of its users, not select figures or institutions. A closed web is an unequitable world for education; only a few people will have access to opportunities for their personal growth. Together, Web3 and the Metaverse have the potential to open the internet to all.\n\n#### Web3\nAn open internet indicates that everyone gets to have ownership over it, and [Web3](https://eshita.mirror.xyz/H5bNIXATsWUv_QbbEz6lckYcgAa2rhXEPDRkecOlCOI) is the infrastructure that enables this. It's a new vision for the Internet where interactions in applications/software are facilitated through wallets; these replace accounts by [serving as both verified identities and funding sources](https://twitter.com/gaby_goldberg/status/1449002871706501133).¬† This mechanic decentralizes the web, empowering users to own their content, data, and assets. This frees them from being shackled to any given platform (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram). By making platforms obsolete, Web3 disincentivizes the creation of finite games; clout-chasing and wealth-creation no longer seems appealing when it's limited to a single platform. \n\nWeb3 is reshaping education into [Ed3](https://ed3.mirror.xyz/0U3QG8-4K6CD_ltU6SJyKN3-uBD3x6nEFs-YeShzYmk), where learners own their education; instead of relying on accredited institutions and centralized distributors (e.g. universities and Udemy), they get to gather skills from a variety of sources and validate this knowledge in their own wallets. Decentralized technology can help education solve its challenges with access, affordability, and accreditation. Learners will no longer be inhibited by their time, location, and money; the credentials they gain will not just serve as signalling, but actually guarantee competency.\n\nIn short, Web3 empowers people to own their digital identities; this in turn enables them to own their education. However, Web3 is still too complex  and confusing for the typical learner. It can't be navigated without a high degree of technical literacy. In order to make this accessible to all, this infrastructure needs a paradigm-shifting interface. McCormick writes that it needs to [\"...add order to the...chaos of decentralization, and give obvious and meaningful utility to digital assets...it will need to...hide complexity beneath the surface, and deliver clean experiences. It will need to create a canvas for both developers and users themselves to create the next million new apps.\"](https://www.notboring.co/p/the-interface-phase?s=r)Basically: what interface is capable of enabling people to freely navigate Web3? Enter the Metaverse.\n\n\n\n#### Metaverse\nAt the same time, the Metaverse also unlocks the value of Web3. Web3 excels at giving digital assets physical characteristics (e.g. cryptocurrencies behaving like cash, NFTs behaving like physical items); the Metaverse doubles down on this, portraying the internet as a tapestry of rich, immersive environments. This visual experience abstracts away Web3's complexity, helping people truly understand and utilize the power of ownership. \n\nAs the ultimate virtual space, the ideal Metaverse would be the perfect environment for embedding education. Its immersive nature enables learning by doing. Platform-native encounters shorten the feedback loop from theory to practice, which helps people deeply internalize their learnings. This is characteristic of an enabling environment; reading about anatomy can't compare to [doing virtual surgery](https://aithority.com/technology/blockchain/immersivetouch-metaverse-set-to-revolutionize-vr-based-surgeries-in-india/). The Metaverse would also help make education more accessible. Knowledge and information have often been gatekept by platforms and institutions. To tackle this problem, embedded education aims to redistribute and embed these into our everyday experience. We're already familiar with the Internet, thinking of it as a place; why not see it as one big university too? An open metaverse could be the new school campus.\n\nTo summarize: if Web3 enables people to own their education, the Metaverse encourages them to deeply engage with it. It does this by freeing people from Web3's complexity and connecting them with like-minded learners. \n\n#### We're ready for this future\nModern youth are already primed for this future; being immersed in digital worlds helps us transition to virtual systems like Web3. [Founder Brian Cho](https://twitter.com/brianjcho/status/1459176570174672897) discusses their advantages:\n- (Value) creation/contribution:\n- Community:\n- Culture:\n\n\nCurrently, it's difficult to see the potential these technologies hold because most mainstream use cases seem frivolous: from collecting expensive animal JPEGs to playing in clunky 3D worlds. However, [the next big thing in technology often looks like a toy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp2gbWsPFgY). This was the case with the Internet. It was initially dismissed by others; but after improving over time (i.e. lower cost, better UX), it was able to achieve widespread adoption to the point that it entrenches our daily lives. I believe a Web3-powered Metaverse is on this same path. But we still need to ensure that it's on the right track.\n\n\n### What does this game look like? (Tentative)\n#### Principles\nIf the future of education looks like a game, then it must also be a digital creative tool. In [\"Computers and Creativity\"](https://www.mollymielke.com/cc), designer Molly Mielke discusses how digital creative tools can potentially be co-creators with human beings; they foster innovation by lowering the barrier to entry, making all users toolmakers and owners. Cultivating human creativity and collaboration should also be the aspiration of an ideal education. How can this purpose be tackled by the technologies we have at our disposal? Mielke names three core concepts, which I'll apply to education:\n\n1.  Educational technology must be **standardized.** Mielke writes that standardization would fundamentally improve digital creative tools by [\"...allowing in more collaborators, making space for greater tooling innovation, and expanding a project's creative constraints beyond any one tool itself.\"](https://www.mollymielke.com/cc#stan) The future of education cannot be built alone; standardization brings both the giant manpower and diverse perspectives needed to bring it to life.\n2.  Educational technology must be **moldable.** It shouldn't just be a digital creative tool ‚Äî it must be powerful enough to be a medium for creative expression. This can be done through providing learners options for customization and support from collaborative communities. The future of education cannot serve everyone if it cannot adapt to anyone's needs.\n3.  Educational technology must be **abstracted.** By being fully responsible for executing tedious tasks, it'll allow learners to fully focus on creativity and play. The future of education cannot only target an enlightened few; for maximum accessibility, it must be hands-on, comprehensible, and participatory. \n\nOverall, in order to bring out learners' full potential, educational technology must be interoperable, moldable, efficient, and community-driven. These are all traits that a Web3-powered Metaverse has. Here's how I see this being developed to its fullest potential, especially for education.\n\n#### Single-Player Learning\nIn this Game, **learning is hands-on**. If one's objective is to master a topic, they can only prove this competency through practical experience. Currently, learners struggle to gain technical skills because the gap between theory and practice is too wide; whether you're an everyday user or an experienced developer, engaging (and building) with technology requires a ton of cognitive effort. This can be seen in learning Web3, where transactions must be understood before being approved, and programming, where [the problem must be visualized before working on it.](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/09/saving-the-world-from-code/540393/) The Game takes on the burden of comprehension by making abstract concepts feel more concrete, leaving learners to focus on critical thinking. At the same time, it would encourage them to have fun, making the steep learning curve less excruciating.\n\nLet's apply this to \"programming by demonstration\". Khan Academy already teaches like this; in their exercises, the left-hand side contains the code while the right-hand side contains the simulation of it. The Game would upgrade this simulation, turning outputs on a screen to a whole world you can interact with, like Minecraft; [it encourages computational thinking in kids through their advanced elements, like redstone and command blocks.](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/17/magazine/the-minecraft-generation.html) Another example is investing in crypto and NFTs: a wealth-building skill that anyone can benefit from. Why read instructional modules when you can experience trading instead? You can do this in [Curious Addy's Trading Club](https://www.curiousaddys.com/), where players can simulate trading cryptocurrencies and NFTs risk-free. Imagine learning other subjects through games too!\n\nIn this Game, you can **Choose Your Own Adventure.** The only requirement for leveling up is practical experience, but it's up to the player to decide how they'll gain this experience. So they customize themselves by choosing what they want to acquire, from learned skills to supported works. This is all shown on [**their own profile.**](https://www.rushil2cents.com/the-internet-as-your-resume/) Wallets could serve as the basis of profiles because they enable [everyone to have their own inventory](https://darkblueheaven.com/newinternetlogic); learners could bring their creations and credentials to whatever platform they go to. Thus, a profile can act as a dynamic resume/passport, where everything you learn and make is automatically shown on-chain.\n\nFor instance, you could get a badge for every educational experience you've attended. This is made possible through [Proof of Attendance Protocols (POAPs)](https://poap.xyz/), NFTs that serve as reliable records of life experiences. Imagine also earning tokens for learning. As a token holder, you'd be able to exchange your tokens for fiat, compensate students/teachers/creators, and make decisions regarding how the group behind the experience operates. For instance, learners in [Crypto, Culture, \u0026 Society](https://ccsdao.xyz) (liberal arts education for crypto) use their tokens for voting on the syllabus, scholarships, guests, etc. Thanks to badges and tokens, passive students become active stakeholders. By helping scale their learning platform, they increase the value of its knowledge; this impact shows on their profile, which helps in leveling up.\n\nProfiles may lead to the emergence of different classes; the profile of an artist will look different from a community builder. Self-expression is the path to leveling up online; McCormick writes: [\"... the more you signal who you are and what you care about, the more you open yourself up to new possibilities.\"](https://www.notboring.co/p/the-great-online-game) These new possibilities are opportunities (e.g. partnerships, offers, projects) that come because people are attracted to your presence. By cultivating your profile, you're **designing your own learning experience.** Nowadays, we don't have control over this;  in an era of mass-produced software, our workflows are dictated by the tools we use. The Game acknowledges our unique thought processes by enabling us [to own the ways we learn and create](https://thesephist.com/posts/tools/).\n\nIn line with this, the teachers of this Game will be full-fledged designers. They'll be designing not just content and delivery, but also environment (where are students learning?) and mechanics (what systems/rules do they have to follow?). In the Metaverse, the forms a classroom can take are endless: [an art gallery](https://oncyber.io/), [a theme park](https://www.animocabrands.com/the-sandbox-partners-with-atari), [a shopping district](https://www.republicrealm.com/metajuku)...anything you want it to be. With more people from diverse backgrounds becoming teachers, classrooms will be greatly transformed in order to fit a variety of learning styles (see [Azlen Elza's classroom design explorations).](https://twitter.com/azlenelza/status/1457346877163143170) \n\nTeachers could also incorporate tokens into the learning experience; these can track almost anything that can be tracked with a smart contract (e.g. reputation on a social platform, skills of a video game character). They could apply this to scaffolded learning: the gradual decrease of support for learners as they increase their understanding. For example, learning opportunities could come in the form of [quests and bounties](https://twitter.com/KatwellKat/status/1502302838537527302); teachers could choose to offer these for specified difficulty levels (e.g. # of XP in skill), and adjust rewards for these accordingly. Imagine all the possible ways learning could happen in this Game.\n\nIt's difficult to learn how to fully customize your education without being exposed to how others mold their own. This is where teachers come in; they act as [toolmakers](https://www.mollymielke.com/cc#mold): pioneering users that share their creations and advocate for a tool's promise. No matter what form they come in (e.g. content creators, community builders), they empower learners by inspiring them to mold their education themselves. But how does one become a teacher in the first place? This isn't just the result of gaining experience; it happens by engaging with a community. After all, what is a teacher without their students? In this Game, you can't level up without playing with others. \n\n**Notes:**\n- put more contrasts: how is suggested innovation better than what currently exists?\n- why is molding important to education?\n\n#### Multiplayer Learning\nIn the future, learning will be a **multiplayer game.** As seen with toolmakers, passionate communities are vital to the learning experiences of gaming and SaaS platforms; imagine Minecraft without its creative builders or Notion without its productivity nerds. Navigating your own education is difficult without having guides and peers supporting you. Thus, it's vital that one's learning experience has a social component; this can take any form, from casual cohorts to intense accelerators. In this Game, choosing your own adventure involves choosing your party ‚Äî the people you're learning with.\n\nIn a Web3-powered Metaverse, communities would look like DAOs, or decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs): [mission-driven groups that coordinate through blockchain-enforced rules](https://linda.mirror.xyz/Vh8K4leCGEO06_qSGx-vS5lvgUqhqkCz9ut81WwCP2o). [This structure enables learners and educators alike to collaboratively steward their education.](https://twitter.com/KatwellKat/status/1490428103612518400) DAOs could act as guilds, onboarding newbies and helping them level up in this game. A niche could exist for every type of person: artists, developers, gamers, investors, etc., and students could choose what best suits their adventure. Membership would be signified with an NFT on their profile, which would give them access to the guild's content and community. Students would grow by acquiring experience points and tokens through completing learning bounties or sharing knowledge with others.\n\nIn this Game, we can **co-create our classrooms.** The future of education can learn a lot from the open-source movement's remixing culture, where people are always building upon each other's creations. This is made possible through open standards, which ensure compatibility (e.g. extensive documentation and free licensing). Creativity also thrives because of an efficient development process (i.e. less time spent on repetitive workflows). One way to increase efficiency is by offering predefined elements. Many open-source projects serve as frameworks for builders, helping them reduce set-up time; this increases the rate of experimentation and innovation.\n\nWhen put together, building blocks form foundational structures. The Game would serve as an infrastructure for learning and creating so that learners wouldn't have to start from scratch. For example, designing your own learning journey: the data your profile contains can recommend skills you could learn, quests/experiences you could take on, people you would vibe with, etc. Teachers can benefit too; they could find a template for any learning experience they want to create. Imagine starting environments for classrooms, social mixers, conferences, etc. These would come from open-source works provided by other creators. Imagine also collaboratively creating curricula. Educational materials (i.e. syllabi, playbooks, journals) would be open-sourced. The culture of remixing will still persist; these materials will always be open to edits, comments, and updates from the general public. \n\nOne problem that can arise from enabling co-creation is attribution and compensation for creators. Whether you're developing open-source software or writing free syllabi, it's difficult to get valued for your work. This is known as the [free-rider problem](https://alisha.mirror.xyz/PxK8PtWDxon0uBH25-ACLSH1nHa89MFj--XAe_wkR6g): why would someone pay for your project when they can enjoy it for free? Web3 tackles this by providing mechanisms that ensure the recognition of creators. One example is [ENS domains](https://ens.domains/): usernames that creators can use across services. Another example is [Quadratic Funding](https://www.radicalxchange.org/concepts/quadratic-funding/): a mathematically optimal model that prioritizes projects based on how many people contributed; this encourages people to make contributions (no matter how small they are) since it's ensured that funds will be democratically allocated in a way that benefits the public. [Gitcoin Grants](https://gitcoin.co/grants/), a Web3-native Kickstarter, uses this for model funding public goods projects. Other problems that can arise are information overload and quality control. In order to tackle these, curators for these materials will be needed more than ever. Profiles can be used to determine if a person has enough experience to become a curator for a certain topic.\n\nHowever, before a learner can start getting involved in a community/project, it's likely that they'd have to go through an application process. This is currently broken for typical places for learning, like schools and workplaces. Profiles, interviews, and references aren't indicative of one's performance; they also take a lot of effort, whether you're the applicant or the evaluator. If this Game is an adventure, then finding your fellow players should be easier. Players could look for the guild/s that suit them by exploring a map, which can be filtered depending on one's interests. Each guild would have its own quest board, which explicitly state what they're looking for; players could determine if they're a fit by matching their profiles to available quests.\n\nOne Web3 startup working on this solution is [Station](https://www.station.express/vision-track-ahead), which is building \"on-chain infrastructure for onboarding \u0026 coordinating contributors of the future.\"¬†DAOs have their own terminals, which feature all their initiatives; each initiative has information on required commitment, reward(s) for contribution, recommended skills, etc. After someone applies to an initiative, they can get endorsed by existing contributors. I'm excited for the network that'll emerge on Station. It'll not only help develop an ecosystem that enables connection, but also the future of profiles: one's relationships, reputation, and identity would be represented through the on-chain contribution and relational data accrued on the platform. \n\nBy enabling co-creation, the Game shows learners that they have the power to create their own universe. A major inspiration for this vision is [Loot Project](https://www.lootproject.com/), the first community-owned NFT gaming platform. It started out as loot bags: NFTs that only consisted of 8 phrases, which depicted \"randomized adventurer gear\".  The community built on top of this, creating everything from [visual renditions of their gear](https://www.lootproject.com/#chapter2) to complex systems they can play in (e.g. [levelling infrasturcture](https://rift.live/), [society and politics](https://bannersnft.com/)). This project is why I'm a believer in Web3-powered Metaverse, showing its potential in community creation, storytelling, and world-building. This is kind of environment that best fosters learning.\n\n#### The Main Quest\nOverall, this Game is all about owning our education. The more people benefit from our learning experiences ‚Äî from designing for yourself to designing for others, the more we level up. We're playing an infinite game where school never ends; we'll always be students and teachers, learning from each other. Together, we can take on our main quest: creating a world where everyone is free to [flourish](https://en.unesco.org/futuresofeducation/sites/default/files/2021-03/Flourishing%20and%20Education_ISEEA%20Research%20Brief.pdf).\n\nIf life is a game, we all want to level up. We choose the type of game we want to play. But for too long, we've been playing finite games. We've played by the rules set by our environments, assuming that winning is the only path we can take. Now, in an technological era that encourages participation and ownership, we're starting to realize that we are free to simply play. And instead of playing against others, we can play together. So do you want to upgrade only yourself, or also help upgrade our world? Your success is up to you.\n\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T15:56:56.988136129Z","tags":null},"/Creation/On-Digital-Gardening":{"title":"On Digital Gardening","content":"## Notes\nFrom my Are.na channels: [Digital Gardens](https://www.are.na/bianca-aguilar/digital-gardens-dzctygsih6y) and [Tools for Thought](https://www.are.na/bianca-aguilar/tools-for-thought-w7et3bbvndy)\n### How the Blog Broke the Web\n+ Homepages\n\t+ Built *by hand*\n\t+ no two were alike\n\t+ Dominant metaphor: table of contents \u003e diary entry\n\t+ We all became amateur librarians\n+ Early web restrictions\n\t+ Online\n\t+ HTML knowledge\n\t+ Hosting account\n+ Slow shift to rapid web publishing; instead of building their own systems, users were working inside one; from manual to effortless\n+ Chronlogical Sort era/reverse chronology bias -\u003e death of the old, cool, weird and hand-organized web\n### Of Digital Streams, Campfires and Gardens\n+ How do we build and maintain our own personal information gardens?

But the multi-linear nature of the garden means that there is no one right view of the bridge, no one correct approach. ==The architect creates the bridge, but it is the visitors to the park which create the bridge‚Äôs meaning.== A good bridge supports many approaches, many views, many seasons, maybe many uses, and the meaning of that bridge will even evolve for the architect over time.\n\n+ The bridge and garden are related to one another inan timeless way\n+ Same goes for everything in the garden in relation to the gardener\n+ We create the garden as a sort of **experience generator**, capable of infinite expression and meaning.\n#### The Stream\n+ newer metaphor, old roots\n\t+ programming \"event stream\"\n\t+ \"lifestream\" proposed by researchers in the 1990s\n\t+ stream -\u003e neverending parade of Twitter, news alerts, Facebook feeds\n+ In the stream metaphor you don‚Äôt experience the Stream by walking around it and looking at it, or following it to its end.

Domestic Cozy\n\t3. intimate and public; less peformative, more intentional and thoughtful\n\t4. perfect balance of chaos and cultivation\n\t5. Imperfection -\u003e learning in public\n\t6. See Digital Garden Terms of Service\n4. **Playful, Personal, and Experimental**\n\t1. non-homogenous by nature\n\t\t1. same seeds, different arrangements\n\t2. organised to match your way of thinking\n\t3. One goal: deep contextualisation\n\t\t1. response to [[Permanent Notes/context collapse]]\n5. **Intercropping \u0026 Content Diversity**\n\t1. not just a collection of interlinked words\n\t2. audio-visual cornucopia\n\t\t1. allows for more than just words\n\t3. Historically, monocropping has been the quickest route to starvation, pests and famine...sustainably intercrop instead\n6. **Independent Ownership**\n\t1. small patch of the web that you own and fully control\n\t2. not on social media platforms\n\t3. helps you plan long-term change\n\t4. prepare for a future of digital gardening that's hopefully multi-player\n\n![[4F4F978D-6D22-4E6A-AF58-CF78DCFBCD98.png]]\n![[428EF213-2441-47CE-9B6C-469337B61532.png]]\n![[3C37E3C3-CA2F-438A-B6D1-57AE6B076FB4.png]]\n![[E6BD0BB8-B298-4F20-9000-08ADC0E55C36.png]]\n![[23DC448F-C984-4B98-8515-E47F914138BC.png]]\n![[77D6EB36-C584-4284-9F81-66E2652A7F3B.png]]\n\nhttps://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners\n\n\u003e I want to add a final note on here: we should be careful not to mistake the technical features of a garden for the ethos of gardening. We have reached the point in the gardening hype train where people seem to think backlinks, hover previews, and visual graphs are what define a \"digital garden.\"\nThis is misguided. ==Gardening is a practice that treats a personal website as a constantly evolving landscape where you develop your ideas in public.==\nGardens are...\na) **Explorable**, rather than structured as a strictly linear steam of posts. This is usually achieved through deeply interlinking notes where readers can navigate freely through the content.\nb) **Slowly grown over time**, rather than creating \"finished\" work that you never touch again. You revise, update, and change your ideas as they develop, and ideally find a way to indicate the \"done-ness\" state to your reader.\n\n\n### Miscellaenous\n![[26D7A6BD-9DBA-4BFE-A725-D480113E41A4.png]]\n\n## Outline\n1.

It's basically all about unplugging and retreating from technology. \n\u003e ==philosophy of relating to technology== I call Waldenponding (after ==Thoreau's Walden Pond experiment== on which Walden is based). The crude caricature is \"smash your smart phone and go live in a log cabin to reclaim your attention and your life from being hacked by evil social media platforms.\"\n- It is driven by FOBO: [[Permanent Notes/Fear of Being Ordinary]] and ego-attachment.\n\t- FOBO is the opposite of FOMO: Fear of Missing Out. This is exploited by third parties who aim to drown you in information.\n\n\u003e If FOMO, Fear Of Missing Out, is the basic fear exploited by third parties that want to drown you in information, the basic fear exploited by people telling you to unplug and retreat is ==FOBO: Fear Of Being Ordinary.==\n\n\n\u003e Waldenponding, I strongly suspect, is ==driven more by FOBO and ego-attachment== than by any real fear of having your mind, productive potential, and rewards destroyed by \"hacked attention.\"\n- Retreating from information flows is just ==a different way of having your attention hacked by others.==\n![[images/Attention Management Turnpike.png]]\n- **Attention Management Turnpike** *(pictured above)*\n\t- Great Thoughts Time\n\t- X Axis: OODA: Observe, Orient, Decide, Act\n\t- Y Axis: Small minds -\u003e great minds \n\t\n\u003e Inspiration from 2 sources: The famous quote ==\"small minds discuss people, average minds discuss events, great minds discuss ideas\"== ( = y axis) and Richard Hamming's idea of scheduling ==\"Great Thoughts\"== calendar time in You and Your Research\n\n![[images/Great Thoughts.png]]\n- We are part of a ==Giant Social Computer in the Cloud (GSCITC)== computing the future. \t\t\n\t- Our \"job\" in this computer is determined by the ==level (size/difficulty) and latency (delay)== at which you consume and act on information \n\t- Shitposting and FOMO actually has a use\n\n\u003e you are part of a ==Giant Social Computer in the Cloud (GSCITC)== computing the future. ==The level and latency at which you consume information and act on it determines your \"job\" in the social computer.== Your shitposting and FOMO are functional.\n\n\u003e Premise: ==FOMO is good.== Being plugged in is good. There is valuable info at all levels from twitter gossip to philosophy books. You should stay plugged in.\n\n- If you don't stay informed, you'll end up with the lowest-level job in the social computer: ==process low-latency information with small-minded cognition.== \n\t- A.k.a. low-level bug reporting/testing\n\t- E.G. [transcribing user audio](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-13/facebook-paid-hundreds-of-contractors-to-transcribe-users-audio)\n\t- Need to upskill basically\n\n\u003e If you don't manage your information economy career, you will default to the lowest-level job in the social computer: ==processing very low-latency information with small-minded cognition (bottom left) for small bets.== It's the equivalent of low-level bug reporting/testing.\n- You can manage your attention by: \n\t- ==being aware== of your current mind size (small to great) \n\t- ==consciously targeting== the zone you want to be in.\n\n\u003e The way to manage your attention is to ==be sensitive to your current mind size (small to great)== and ==consciously target the zone you want to be in,== moving fluidly between small/great mind.\n\n- Failure: an information diet that doesn't enable you to translate your information consumption/production choices into winning bets\n\t- Summary of ==three ways to fail:==\n\t\t- trying to be Great Minded all the time\n\t\t- trying to be Great Minded with a mostly low-latency information diet\n\t\t- trying to consume a high-latency information diet without aspiring to create more than small-minded thoughts\n\n\n\u003e There are ==THREE ways to fail== at this: a) Thinking you can be Great Minded all the time. b) Trying to be Great Minded purely on a low-latency information diet (upper-left red box) c) Trying to consume a high-latency information diet without aspiring to more than small-minded thoughts (lower-right red box)\n\n\u003e Each failure mode is an information diet that leads to patterns of betting that fail to deliver a positive return long-term. It's not addictive FOMOing that kills you, but not being able to translate the information consumption/production choices you're making into winning bets.\n\n- 1st failure mode: trying to consume only information at your target level\n\t- Information diet input is ==needed from all levels to work at any level==\n\t- E.G. trying to \"float\" atention at a focused point \n\t- the danger in this is that ==your mind-level might choose you==, instead of the other way around\n\n\u003e The first failure mode manifests as trying to consume only information at your target level. This will fail. ==You need some information diet input from ALL levels to work at ANY level==\n\n\u003e  ==Trying to \"float\" your attention at a focused point on the turnpike== rather than distributing attention all along it is the other way to ==fail==\n\n\u003e  The danger in executing this turnpike roadmap strategy is that ==your mind-level might choose you rather than you choosing your mind-level.==\n\n- 2nd failure mode: trying to output ==Great Thoughts== with only ==low-latency live information==\n\n\u003e  The second failure mode manifests as ==trying to have Great Thoughts on a diet of pure low-latency live information== (upper-left red box).\n- 3rd failure mode: keeping up with all information at all latencies with a ==small-minded level==\n\t- The more latency there is, the bigger mind you need\n\n\u003e The final failure mode is trying to ==keep up with all the information at all latencies at a small-minded level== (lower-right red box).\n\n\u003e Higher latency requires ==higher abstraction levels/bigger minds== to extract value.\n- Training attention is like ==weight training.== \n\t- You need to increase your load slowly (e.g. 10s -\u003e 10min), and maybe train to exhaustion.\n\t\t- Small mind and can only read/make tweets? Try an essay\n\t\t- Great mind and can only process philosophy books? Try Twitter for 15min\n\t\t\t- like low-weights/high-volume endurance training\n\n\n\u003e This is a bit like ==weight training.== You have to increase the weights slowly and perhaps ==train your attention to exhaustion== a bit. If you're in small mind zone and can only consume/produce tweets, try an essay. See how far you get. Strength-train attention from 10s to 10min. You can and should go the other way as well. If you can only read big philosophy books by dead people and processing the chaotic churn of a Toxic Day on Twitter is too much for you, try handling it for 15 minutes, then an hour. Try posting instead of just reading. This is like ==low-weights/high-volume endurance training.== Harder than it looks.\n\n\n- The ==load== you're training against: ==attention-hacking designs.== \n- But the atrophying of attention and latency limits will always happen due to the ==information firehose,== a.k.a. the result of free/cheap information distribution in our digital world\n\n\n\u003e  this ==atrophying of attention and latency limits== will happen REGARDLESS of whether evil designers are trying to hack your attention and keep you phase-locked into their preferred 10s latency information loop. ==Their designs are in fact the LOAD you're training against==\n\n\u003e  information distribution has become free/cheap, so the firehose is going to have flows at all timescales, time constants, and abstraction levels no matter what designers and advertisers want or don't want. ==It's the information firehose itself that's creating this environment not evil designers.==\n- Back in a pre-digital world, attention was originally hacked by powerful religious leaders who'd tell people to unplug from information flows, giving them power as a result.\n\t- Also based on [[Permanent Notes/Fear of Being Ordinary]]\n\n\n\u003e ==the original attention hack: powerful religious leaders== telling smart people to check out and unplug from information flows. That way, they get the power\n\n\n\u003e  This game is based on the opposite fear to FOMO which I call FOBO. If FOMO is Fear of Missing Out, FOBO is Fear Of Being Ordinary.\n- In the GSCITC, we are simply a ==unique instance== of a computerized human intelligence. \n\t- However, the GSCITC cannot give you ==individual recognition.==\n\t- This flattens our egos and identities.\n\t- This is the heart of [[Permanent Notes/Fear of Being Ordinary]]. We just don't want to be another component of the GSCTIC; our efforts aren't recognized even if they contribute to the system\n\n\n\u003e When you are plugged into the GSCITC, ==you are part of a great computational fluidization of human cognition.== You're just ==one instance== in a liquid cloud of human intelligence, your thoughts entangled with those of others in a giant ongoing computation.\n\n\n\u003e  This fluidization is a different eme rgent social phenomenon from the homogenization achieved by Organization Man corporations. ==Instead of being a faceless interchangeable part, you are a unique entangled particle in a quantum soup.==\n\n\n\u003e  The cost though is that even if your contributions are unique and your personal payoff makes it worthwhile if you do it right, ==the one thing the liquid cloud can't offer you is individual recognition.==\n\n\u003e  The GSCITC is not a homogenizer of effort or imagination, but ==it IS a homogenizer of egos and identities. ==What you do counts. Who you are doesn't. You are an ordinary part of an extraordinary process.\n\n\u003e  This is the heart of FOBO. Fear of Being Ordinary. ==Fear of being just another entangled particle in the GSCITC.== Fear of your ego dissolving into the collective ego. Fear of having \"nothing to show\" for playing a part, despite it being sustainable.\n\n- A real adept should be able to: \n\t- 1.) turn even the most toxic Twitter  stream into ==actionable insight==\n\t- 2.) have ==strength-trained attention,== so that they can consume whatever they want \n\n\n\u003e A real adept oughta be able to meditate on the angriest, most toxic twitter stream, consume the bile, and turn it into nectar: ==actionable insight you can bet on in the real world.==\n\n\u003e  ==A real adept ought to have strength-trained attention== so they can spend an hour either reading a tweetstream or a once-in-a-generation history-disrupting philosophy book.\n- Overall, the GSCITC is the ==only mechanism enabling us to tackle world problems== (that industrial age mechanisms couldn't cope with). So we need to do our best in it by staying connected.\n\n\n\u003e We are all now part of a powerful global social computer in the cloud that is possibly ==the only mechanism we have available to tackle the big problems of the world that industrial age mechanisms are failing to cope with.== We might as well get good at it. Do your part. Stay as plugged in as you can.\n\n### Against Waldenponding 2\n- Horcrux allegory (don't trust a tangible soul) vital to our relationship with digital devices. However, digital devices aren't horcruxes; in reality, they're the ==Walden ponds.==\n\n\u003e never trust anything that can make its own meaning if you can see where it keeps its soul.\n\n\u003e \"soul\" loosely as a ==metaphor for meaning-making ability.==\n\n\u003e Unlike intelligence, a soul (metaphoric or literal) ==isn't supposed to take on such a tangible form factor==\n\n\u003e Meaning-making entities -- humans, and organizations -- can only be trusted if they don't seem to know for sure where their soul is.\n\n\u003e Believe it or not, this nebulous philosophical allegory is central to the seemingly mundane question of ==how much time you should be spending staring at the screens of digital devices.== Interestingly though, it is NOT our digital devices that are the untrustworthy horcruxes in this story. ==The true horcruxes are the objects that waldenponders believe are more deserving of your attention: the Walden ponds.==\n- [[Permanent Notes/You have agency over your own attention]].\n\t- E.G. ad blockers, cogntive frames\n\t- Therefore, if you think your attention is getting \"hacked\", it's because you're allowing it\n\n\n\u003e you aren't an NPC -- non-playing/playable character -- in the battle for your own attention. You have tools ranging from ad blockers to cognitive reframes. If you're letting your attention get \"hacked\", it's because you're choosing to. ==If you think the only kind of agency you have is the agency to uncritically withdraw to save your soul, you've been pwned, but it isn't by the tech platforms.==\n- Waldenponding is the ==demonization of digital devices.== \n\t- But devices are actually more like magic tricks; they're designed by humans to misdirect your attention.\n\t- Manipulate you into creating Walden ponds\n\n\n\u003e  ==Waldenponding = primitivist, fetishistic fear of screens as demonic objects.== A way of relating to digital devices that seems shaped by a fearmongering vision of them as soul-sucking pumps, and their designers as Dark Lords who are far too powerful for you, mere mortal,  to actively resist. Your only reliable weapon, they say, is the off switch.\n\n\u003e  ==demonization of digital devices== -- perfectly ordinary objects governed by the laws of physics and designed by mere humans --  is something like a magic trick, where the magician wants to misdirect your attention. While you're busy worrying about the evil rectangles of light stealing your soul, you are missing the real danger: the horcruxes they are tempting you to create and trust with legibilized, dead bits of your soul.\n\n- Waldenponding is a search for meaning similar to ==idolization.== The idol here can be anything that's not a digital device.\n\t- E.G. paper book, session of manual labor, hike in the woods\n\t- They act as tangible focal points which the quests (for meaning) ==revolve around,== preventing one from going too far.\n\t- This is what makes Waldenponding dangerous, and it's worse because it's ==seen as a way to do the opposite== (idolization)\n\n\u003e  Waldenponding is a search for meaning that is ==circumscribed by the what you might call the spiritual gravity field of an object or behavior held up as ineffably sacred.== The associated literal pattern of religiosity is idolatry. Today, the ==\"idol\"== in question is generally characterized by negative definition as ==\"almost anything other than the profane digital device screen.\"== It can take a variety of forms: the in-person conversation, the board game, the hike in the woods, the session of manual labor, the construction project, the family dinner, the paper book. All are excellent things, to be valued for what they literally are. But as suggested repositories for bits of your soul, they are incredibly dangerous.\n\n\u003e  the loci at the hearts of the narratives are more than mere motifs or synecdoches for larger spiritual quests. They serve as ==physically embodied focal points around which the quests themselves revolve,== like strange attractors. Though the protagonists may, through the narrative, explore the universe in much more expansive ways, you can see where they keep bits of their souls locked down; the zone that keeps drawing them back; the idol that prevents them from wandering too far.\n\n\u003e  Each in its natural form is a perfectly fine thing. ==It is only when transformed into sacralized fragments of \"soul\" that they turn into dangerous Dark Magic objects. Waldenponding is dangerous because it encourages you to do exactly that.== The effect is particularly insidious because it is presented as a way to do the opposite.\n- How to tell if it's a horcrux:\n\t- 1.) Do you know where it keeps its brain?\n\t\t- For devices: brain = intelligence\n\t- 2.) Does it seem to embody a \"soul\" tangibly?\n\t\t- For device: legible piece of soul?\n\n\n\u003e Horcrux tests: ==do you know where it keeps its brain?== And ==Does it seem to embody a \"soul\" in more tangible form than you'd expect== from our everyday casual-spiritual sense of the term?\n\n\u003e  Same tests applied to devices: ==Do you know where it keeps its intelligence? And Is it a legible piece of soul?==\n- Tested on Waldenponds:\n\t- 1.) No. Waldenponder object/activity pairs are shown as a device connected to a collation of inherited ==cultural intelligence==\n\t\t- this cannot be investigated; you can only surrender to it through ==ritualistic behaviors==\n\t- 2.) Yes. They are the ==secular equivalents of temples.==\n\n\u003e  First horcrux answer: Nope! ==Each object/activity pair is usually portrayed by waldenponders as a client device connected to a vast cloud of inherited cultural intelligence.== And they are right! Each of these objects/behavior is a classic horcrux candidate because it is ==old enough for illegible, unplottable patterns of cultural intelligence to have formed around it. You cannot probe this intelligence, only surrender to it through ceremonial, mythologized behaviors==\n\n\n\u003e  Second horcrux answer: Yep! Waldenponders talk of these things as tangible embodiments and reliable catalysts of ineffable states of mind. They are ==secular equivalents of temples.==\n- Tested on devices:\n\t- 1.) Yes (e.g. RAM, data center, etc.)\n\t- 2.)

He‚Äôs   weighty,   as   in   important .   There‚Äôs   something   about   this God that we need to stand in awe of. And all through the Scriptures, God‚Äôs glory is about two things: Presence and beauty.\n   \n   \u003e God‚Äôs   kavod   here   isn‚Äôt   his   fame;   it‚Äôs   his   presence   ‚Äî   the   fact   that   he   was   there ,   not   far   away,   but   close.   Heav- en and earth were wed, if only for a moment. And it‚Äôs his beauty ‚Äî this staggering sense of how good he really is.\n- [[Permanent Notes/God is an artist]].\n   \u003e God is a lavish, opulent,   extravagant   artist ,   and   creation   is   his   beauty   on   display.\n\n\n   \u003e As people made in his image ‚Äî all work is artistic. All work is inherently creative. All work ‚Äî from painting to parenting ‚Äî is reshaping the raw materials of Planet Earth in such a way that it‚Äôs how God intended, how it‚Äôs supposed to be, all so humans can thrive as they see God‚Äôs glory.\n- ==We are God's partners in creation.==\n   \u003e  As   people   made   in   God‚Äôs   image,   we   can   join   him   in   this   ongoing   creative   work.   As   his   partners,   we   can   re- shape   the   raw   materials   of   his   world   in   such   a   way   that   people   see   the   beauty   behind   the   beauty. \n\n\n    \u003e  ‚ÄúGood design is putting our best forward; it is working hard to bring beauty into the world. When I see something that is brilliant it wrecks me in the best sort of way. I am also constantly returning to this idea that we were created with the ability to create and that makes our God the most generous of all. I‚Äôm humbled after I complete every new project, and as I stand there with a big silly grin on my face, I feel his presence and approval.‚Äù\n- ADHD, stress, etc. are just ==symptoms of an unraveling world/culture.==\n    \u003e We   are   fractured   and   pulled   in   a   thousand   different   directions. ADHD, stress, workaholism, burnout, connectivity ‚Äî these are just words we come up with to name a world that is unraveling at the seams.\n\n\n    \u003e  These are the signs of a life without rest.\n- To be a ==disciple== is to be a ==good person.==\n    \u003e Discipleship   is   about   learning   how   to   become   a   good   human   being.   And   how   to   live   into   both   your   callings, to   make   disciples   and   to   create   culture.  \n\n\n    \u003e Do your work as an expression of love and service, ultimately to God, and then to your neighbor.\n- Focus requires ==awareness of what we are called to== and NOT called to.\n    \u003e To   focus,   we   need   to   know   what   we‚Äôre   called   by   God   to   do,   and   what   we‚Äôre   not   called   to   do. \n\n\n    \u003e To borrow from the language of Jesus, you gotta figure what the ‚Äúwork the Father gave you to do‚Äù is. And   then   you   need   to   learn   the   art   of   saying   no.   To   good   things .   A   smart   man   once   said,   ‚ÄúGood   is   the   enemy of   best.‚Äù \n\n\n    \u003e So we all have gifts, but we don‚Äôt all have the same dosage of grace. Some of us have more; others have less. And that‚Äôs okay. Your   job   isn‚Äôt   to   be   the   best   in   your   field,   just   the   best   version   of   yourself.\n- [[Permanent Notes/The best way to serve others with our work is to serve the work]].\n    \u003e A genuine, authentic love of excellence isn‚Äôt rooted in greed or narcissism or materialism ‚Äî that‚Äôs dualism talking.   It‚Äôs   rooted   in   love ,   for   God   and   others.   A   desire   to   serve   God   and   his   world   well. \n    \n\t\u003e Dorothy Sayers, this spunky, rebellious British writer from half a century ago, said that the best way to serve others with our work is to ‚Äúserve the work.‚Äù\n    \n\t\u003e Do one thing. And   do   one   thing   well . And do that one thing well as an act of service and love for the world and to the glory of God.\n    \n\t\u003e If you‚Äôre really good at whatever it is you do, you don‚Äôt need to tell the rest of us. We‚Äôll know. Beautiful things don‚Äôt ask for attention.\n- [[Permanent Notes/Work can become a god in and of itself]].\n    \u003e My point is that as human beings, we have this slant to look to our work for significance we can only find in God. When we uncouple our work from God, work becomes a sort of god in and of itself.\n\n\n    \u003e Because the curse drives us to God. If it weren‚Äôt for the curses ‚Äî on both the family and the field ‚Äî we would look to whatever it is we do for work   or   rest,   and   we   would   find   it .   And   nothing   could   be   more   disastrous   for   the   world   than   God‚Äôs   image   bear- ers finding identity and belonging and even satisfaction apart from him.\n- Sabbath isn't just a day of rest; it's a ==day to delight in our work.==\n    \u003e Sabbath   isn‚Äôt   just   a   day   to   not   work ;   it‚Äôs   a   day   to   delight   in   what   one   Hebrew   poet   called   ‚Äúthe   work   of   our hands.‚Äù ¬≥   To   delight   in   the   life   you‚Äôve   carved   out   in   partnership   with   God,   to   delight   in   the   world   around   you, and to delight in God himself. Sabbath is a day to pull up a chair, sink into it, look back over the work of the last six   days,   and   just   enjoy.\n- Sabbath gives us ==life.==\n    \u003e The Sabbath has a life-giving ability to procreate ‚Äî to fill the world up with life.\n\n\n    \u003e But   rest   refills   us   ‚Äî   with   energy,   creativity,   vision,   strength,   optimism,   buoy- ancy, clarity, and hope. Rest is life-giving.\n\n\n    \u003e It‚Äôs   a   day   for   rest,   and   it‚Äôs   a   day   for   worship. When I Sabbath, I run everything through this grid ‚Äî is this rest? Is this worship? If the answer to both questions is yes, then I delight in it; if the answer is no, then I hold off until the next day. Because the Sabbath is not the same thing as a day off.\n\n\n    \u003e The   point   is   that   there   is   a   way   the   Creator   set   the   creation up   to   thrive.   A   way   that   God   set   you   up   to   thrive.   And   when   we   Sabbath,   we   tap   into   God‚Äôs   rhythm   for   human flourishing.\n\n\n    \u003e The Sabbath is a day to embrace this reality, to let it sink in, to own it, to celebrate it. To celebrate our weak- ness,   our   mortality,   our   limits .   To   celebrate   our   God   of   strength   and   immortality   and   limitless   power.   To   rest with   him   and   to   rest   in   him.\n- [[Permanent Notes/Everything has a cost]].\n    \u003e Everything   we enjoy costs something. And if it doesn‚Äôt cost us, it costs someone else.\n- The Sabbath is ==freeing.==\n    \u003e The Sabbath is about leaving Egypt behind. About emancipation from Pharaoh‚Äôs suffocating rule. It‚Äôs about freedom.\n\n\n    \u003e It‚Äôs   a   way   to   remember   and   never   forget   that   what   we‚Äôre   craving,   and   even coveting, isn‚Äôt found in the world of space, but in the world of time ‚Äî in God himself.\n    \n\t\u003e The Sabbath is more of an art form than a list of dos and don‚Äôts.\n    \n\t\u003e the   Sabbath   is   a   day   for   healing.\n- Jesus is the ==embodiment== of the Sabbath.\n    \u003e Jesus is the embodiment of the Sabbath. He‚Äôs the seventh day in flesh and blood. We can come to him and find   rest ,   not   just   on   the   Sabbath,   but   all   week   long.\n- The Sabbath gives us a chance to ==reset and realign.==\n    \u003e  Sabbath isn‚Äôt just a Pause button ‚Äî it‚Äôs a full, complete, total system restart.\n    \n\t\u003e Sabbath is a chance to take a long, hard look at our lives and to retune them to the right key. To make sure that our life is shaped around what really matters. And when we see stuff in our life that is out of whack, then we turn to Jesus, and he comes and does his healing Sabbath work.\n- Our ==eschatology== shapes our ==ethics.==\n- Our work in this life is ==practice for our work in the coming life.==\n   \u003e Work   isn‚Äôt   a   means   to   an   end;   it   is   an   end.\n   \n   \u003e Our   work   in   this   life   is   practice   for   our   work   in   the   coming   life.\n   \n   \u003e Some of the good work we do will actually last into God‚Äôs new world.\n    \n\t\u003e So   we   work   in   the   present   world   ‚Äî   right   in   the   middle   of   all   the   chaos   and   entropy   and   suffering   and   pain   ‚Äî for   a   glimpse   of   the   future   world,   set   free   from   evil   and   death   itself.\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T15:56:56.988136129Z","tags":null},"/Literature-Notes/Half-Baked-Futures-Literature-Notes":{"title":"Half-Baked Futures - Literature Notes","content":"See [[Resource Notes/Half-Baked Futures - Newsletter]]\n#literaturenotes \n## All the world's a stage + communicative friction\n- [[Permanent Notes/context collapse]] \n\u003e But our friends lists grew longer and further from the notion of friendship, a phenomenon that Internet scholar danah boyd dubbed ==\"context collapse\".== We began to filter our words: Is this important enough to post?

The literature presented in their proposal was filled with scientific terms which helped make the case of their vision as modern and data-driven.\n\t+ ==A utilitarian vision is easier to sell politically== than a romantic one proposed by Dewey, especially when it comes to expensive publicly-supported institutions like education. While Dewey talked about engaging the interest of the child to promote a richer understanding of the world to promote a more just and richer society, the administrative progressives talked about ==fixing social problems and expanding the economy.==\n+ Instead of Dewey's vision, the administration ran with a ==social efficiency agenda== as an expression of democratic ideals.\n+ Changes that took place:\n\t+ the structure of curriculum tracking\n\t+ the tailoring of instruction to the academic skills of individual students\n\t+ the use of standardized testing for student placement\n\t+ the shift from purely academic studies to a more practical nature.\n\n### Why Snedden's view on education is problematic\n+ he viewed education as a way to prepare for a person's calling in life.\n+ way of thinking is one that optimizes for social efficiency and is discriminatory: he believed that only the elites should obtain liberal education while the rest of the people should be trained in a vocation.\n\t+ [[Permanent Notes/Education lives within a system of domination and liberation]]\n+ Is Snedden's vocationalism is the answer to ending poverty? Critics have argued that it does not.\n\t+ In this model of education (people are either consumers or producers), education is a tool to increase their potential earnings and escape poverty; the status quo is always upheld. ==When someone is educated, another uneducated person slots right into the role.==\n+ On the contrary, Dewey's vision of democratic education serves more beyond increasing earning potential. He envisioned that with proper rich education experience, ==people will be better equipped to cure social ills== that need to be addressed including poverty and crime as well as health concerns.\n\n## Vocationalism today\n### Vocational schools and coding bootcamps\n+ Types:\n\t+ Vocational school\n\t+ Coding bootcamps with ISAs\n\t+ companies partnering up with Institutions to either sponsor education or work collaboratively to set a curriculum.\n+ As corporations become partners with education providers, a ==conflict-of-interest== emerges.\n\u003e While a tuition-free education along with a part-time salary sounds like a sweet deal for students, Lutchen believes it‚Äôs the schools that stand to gain the most, financially speaking. He explains that a significant proportion of students require financial aid, with each one reducing the institution‚Äôs overall revenue. When a private company is paying the tab, however, the university is able to collect on the full cost.\n\u003e \n\u003e ‚ÄúThe mission of the institution is not to create employees for a specific company with a narrow set of skills that only that company can use; that would violate the mission of the undergraduate experience,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIn fact, about 40% of engineers end up not working in engineering 10, 15 years after they graduate, so that would be a big concern.‚Äù\n\u003e \n\u003e ‚ÄúThe student is made to feel committed to the program rather than have an open mind, because the tuition dollars will stop if they want to switch majors,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why we would not do that. We would say ‚Äòpay us a certain amount to be on the steering committee, be a member of a consortium of companies.‚Äô And then we know we‚Äôre preparing students for a variety of corporate pathways, not just one.‚Äù\n\n\n### Microcredentials and universities\n+ **Microcredentials:**  compressed online courses with a highly targeted curriculum to allow the learner to apply the knowledge directly to a workplace.\n+ interesting phenomenon:  a partnership between universities with online providers such as EdX to provide these microcredentials.\n+  On the surface, the movement sounds like a great idea for students: unbundling university courses ==lowers the price==, and removing admission requirements also makes the courses ==more accessible.== \n+ However, a ==conflict of interest== between students and corporation might arise by engaging with microcredential production:\n\n\u003e As microcredentialing purveyors, colleges and universities also make themselves increasingly subservient to their new clients: businesses and corporations in need of rapid, targeted vocational training for their employees. The traditional mission of enabling student growth through transformative teaching is traded for a corporate mission of ==maximizing efficiency and profitability at all costs.==\n\n\n\u003e the boom in microcredentials is being fed in large part by major companies‚ÄîIBM, Google, and Amazon, to name a few‚Äîlooking to ==grow their talent pipeline== and ==increase the skill level of current employees==\n\n+ Microcredentials contribute to the ==decline of the traditional degree== by paving a way for people to substitute degree programs. For instance, Kazin and Clerkin ask, ‚Äòwhy should an individual bother to pursue a full master‚Äôs degree if five courses alone are enough to confer career success?‚Äô.\n\n## Conclusion\n+ Dewey believed...\n\t+ that a broad and diverse liberal education will lead to more well-rounded individuals who will then be better able to contribute to a democratic society in order to ==solve social ills.== \n\t+ that an education that is vocational (i.e. an education I can fully apply to the workplace) is an effective way to maintain the status quo and is ==ineffective for large scale changes==:\n\n\u003e The kind of vocational education in which I am interested is not one which will ‚Äòadapt‚Äô workers to the existing industrial regime; I am not sufficiently in love with the regime for that. It seems to me that the business of all who would not be educational time-servers is to resist every move in this direction, and to strive for a kind of vocational education which will ==first alter the existing industrial system, and ultimately transform it==].\n\n![Left Behind](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3ead8a6f-03cb-4213-8895-e975fa35cac5_1312x1002.png)\n\n+ When viewed through the lens of job creation and boosting the economy, vocational education does a good job at upholding that. However, in the lens of education and democracy, ==vocationalism strikes to undermine democracy.==\n\n\u003e It is not sufficient, and it may actually undermine our democracy, to concentrate on producing people who do well on standardized tests and who define success as getting a well-paid job. ==Democracy means more than voting and maintaining economic productivity, and life means more than making money and beating others to material goods.==\n\n+ In his paper, Ralston described that ==microcredentials fall short of educating a whole person.== The point he brings up works equally well when we replace microcredentials with vocationalism.\n\t+ [[Permanent Notes/Critical thinking and skill development are not mutually exclusive]]\n\n\u003e Microcredentialing is unconcerned with educating the whole person. Unlike Liberal Arts education, which catalyzes changes in the entire character of the learner, vocationally oriented microcredentialing ==seeks only to transfer hard skills and technical competencies== to the client-learner. In the absence of a General Education component, microcredentialing tends to ==cultivate only a single dimension, aspect, or element of the learner‚Äôs character, effectively producing a technician, not a well-rounded person.== Past president of the University of Chicago, Robert Hutchins (1936/1958), voiced a similar complaint about vocational train- ing: ‚ÄòThe pursuit of knowledge for its own sake is being rapidly obscured in universities and may soon be extinguished. [ . .] [S]oon everybody in a university will be there for the purpose of being trained for something. [ . .] It is plain, though, that it is bad for the universities to vocationalize them‚Äô (36‚Äì7). Insofar as microcredentialing fails to educate the whole person, it exacerbates one symptom of the neoliberal learning economy, namely, the turn away from pursuing knowledge for its own sake and towards learning to earn (Siskin and Warner 2019).\n\n\n+ By providing vocational training exclusively, higher education institutions cut their students off from more elevated pursuits (e.g. art, history, cultural studies) and ==condemn them to a life of subservience to their industrial and corporate masters.==","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T15:56:56.988136129Z","tags":null},"/Literature-Notes/Monomythical-Literature-Notes":{"title":"Monomythical - Literature Notes","content":"## Notes\n#literaturenotes \nSee [[notes/1.

This results in repeated destruction of intelligent civilizations.\n\u003e from author Liu Ciuxin‚Äôs The Three Body Problem, about the universe\n\u003e the Earth is awaiting an invasion from the closest star system, which in this universe consists of three solar-type stars orbiting each other in an unstable three-body system, with a single Earth-like planet unhappily being passed among them and suffering extremes of heat and cold, as well as the repeated destruction of its intelligent civilizations.\n- Is our universe an empty forest or a dark one? Definitely dark.\n\t- Only Earth is foolish enough to announce itself; the rest of the universe knows why the forest stays dark.\n\t- ==The Internet too has dark forests==, and we're going back to them thanks to the noise of ads, trolling, etc.\n \u003e  Imagine a dark forest at night. It‚Äôs deathly quiet. Nothing moves. Nothing stirs. This could lead one to assume that the forest is devoid of life. But of course, it‚Äôs not. The dark forest is full of life. It‚Äôs quiet because night is when the predators come out. To survive, the animals stay silent.\n \u003e  Is our universe an empty forest or a dark one? If it‚Äôs a dark forest, then only Earth is foolish enough to ping the heavens and announce its presence. The rest of the universe already knows the real reason why the forest stays dark. It‚Äôs only a matter of time before the Earth learns as well.\n \u003e  In response to the ads, the tracking, the trolling, the hype, and other predatory behaviors, we‚Äôre retreating to our dark forests of the internet, and away from the mainstream.\n - Dark forests in the internet are spaces that make ==conversation without pressure== possible.\n\t - This is because of their ==non-indexed, non-optimized, and non-gamified== environments.\n\t - E.G. newsletters, podcasts, Slack channels, private Instagrams, invite-only message boards, text groups, Snapchat, Wechat, etc.\n \u003e  Dark forests like newsletters and podcasts are growing areas of activity. As are other dark forests, like Slack channels, private Instagrams, invite-only message boards, text groups, Snapchat, WeChat, and on and on.\n \u003e  These are all spaces where depressurized conversation is possible because of their non-indexed, non-optimized, and non-gamified environments.\n - Right now,  the public and semi-public spaces we've created are now spaces for ==a relentless competition for power. (e.g. market, political, social)==\n\t - Originally, they were created to ==develop our identities, cultivate communities, and gain knowledge.==\n\t - Because of the growth of this competition, we've retreated to dark forests.\n \u003e  The public and semi-public spaces we created to develop our identities, cultivate communities, and gain knowledge were overtaken by forces using them to gain power of various kinds (market, political, social, and so on).\n \u003e This is the atmosphere of the mainstream web today: a relentless competition for power. As this competition has grown in size and ferocity, an increasing number of the population has scurried into their dark forests to avoid the fray.\n- Dark forests provide ==psychological and reputational cover==; since we know who else is there, we can be our truest selves.\n\t- More Scandivanian in values and social + emotional security\n\t- Versus the communication style of mass channels\n\t\t- High risks + rewards, and limited moderation\n\u003e  The dark forests grow because they provide psychological and reputational cover. They allow us to be ourselves because we know who else is there. Compared to the free market communication style of the mass channels ‚Äî with their high risks, high rewards, and limited moderation ‚Äî dark forest spaces are more Scandinavian in their values and the social and emotional security they provide. \n - According to the [[Permanent Notes/Bowling Alley Theory of the Internet]], people go online just to meet each other. In the long term, the venues we congregate in are unimportant compared to the ==interactions themselves.==\n \u003e  the Bowling Alley Theory of the Internet: that people are online purely to meet each other, and in the long run the venues where we congregate are an unimportant background compared to the interactions themselves.\n - Community builders (a.k.a. dark forests) underestimate how powerful these mainstream channels are; our havens will be minor compared to their immensity.\n\t - Social media like FB, Twitter, etc. won't go away.\n\t -  ==The meaning and tone of these platforms changes with who uses them.== What kind of bowling alley it is depends on who goes there.\n\t\t -  Related notes:\n\t\t\t -  [[Permanent Notes/context collapse]]\n\t\t\t -  [[Permanent Notes/Everyone always acts in accordance with their internal narratives]]\n\t - If a significant portion of the population leaves these spaces, it will also leave people left to influence, and limit the influence of those who left. This might make the dark forest more dangerous. Do you really want to give power to those in the dark?\n\u003e And those of us building dark forests risk underestimating how powerful the mainstream channels will continue to be, and how minor our havens are compared to their immensity.\n\u003e The influence of Facebook, Twitter, and others is enormous and not going away. There‚Äôs a reason why Russian military focused on these platforms when they wanted to manipulate public opinion: they have a real impact. The meaning and tone of these platforms changes with who uses them. What kind of bowling alley it is depends on who goes there.\n\u003e  Should a significant percentage of the population abandon these spaces, that will leave nearly as many eyeballs for those who are left to influence, and limit the influence of those who departed on the larger world they still live in.\n\u003e  If the dark forest isn‚Äôt dangerous already, these departures might ensure it will be.\n### Beyond the Dark Forest  Theory of the Internet\n- The Internet is no longer experimental, it's stakes have gone too high.\n\t- Now, the internet is emotionally, reputationally, and physically dangerous. It has become the dark forest.\n\t\t- E.G. Bullying, shaming, swatting\n\t- Our digital breadcrumbs can be used as evidence against us.\n\t- Because of this, we stay silent, and moved underground. For our safety.\n\u003e  The internet went from a venue for low stakes experimentation to the place with some of the highest stakes of all. With the rise of online bullying, shaming (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00L9B7IRC/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8\u0026btkr=1), and swatting (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swatting), the internet became emotionally, reputationally, and physically dangerous. It became the dark forest. Our digital breadcrumbs became evidence that could and would be used against us. To keep safe we exercised our right to stay silent and moved underground.\n- Back to Ciuxin's [[Permanent Notes/The Three Body Problem]].

A black domain stops everything from getting in or out. It‚Äôs security through cosmic self-imprisonment.\n\u003e  Dark forests like email lists and Slack groups are more forgiving than Liu‚Äôs black domains. They‚Äôre off-grid, but they aren‚Äôt that off-grid.

Not many of us are that hardcore with our digital habits yet. But when it comes to showing our true selves online, many of us are more like black domains than we care to admit.\n - If there's ==little connection/influence to the outside world,== dark forests can turn into black domains.\n\t - How can we make change for the better if we stay in these forests? In order to improve the communities and cultures we're part of, we have to ==actively engage== with them.\n\t -  What kind of influence does that mean I really have?

The alternative is to intentionally create a product or service that people decide is worth talking about. I call this a Purple Cow.\n- Don't aim for breaking big on social media; start small with a [[Permanent Notes/Minimum viable audience]].\n\u003eThe goal isn‚Äôt to maximize your social media numbers.

We rarely think about this sort of natural, basic self-centredness because it‚Äôs so socially repulsive. But it‚Äôs pretty much the same for all of us. It is our default setting, hard-wired into our boards at birth.\n- Learning ==how to think== consists of learning how to ==control== what we pay ==attention== to + how we construct ==meaning== from experience\n  \u003elearning how to think really means learning how to exercise some control over how and what you think. It means being conscious and aware enough to choose what you pay attention to and to choose how you construct meaning from experience. Because if you cannot exercise this kind of choice in adult life, you will be totally hosed. Think of the old clich√© about ‚Äúthe mind being an excellent servant but a terrible master.‚Äù\n- It's within our power to see ==excruciating== experiences as ==meaningful== ones\n  \u003eIf you‚Äôre automatically sure that you know what reality is, and you are operating on your default setting, then you, like me, probably won‚Äôt consider possibilities that aren‚Äôt annoying and miserable.

There is no such thing as not worshipping. Everybody worships. The only choice we get is what to worship. And the compelling reason for maybe choosing some sort of god or spiritual-type thing to worship‚Äìbe it JC or Allah, be it YHWH or the Wiccan Mother Goddess, or the Four Noble Truths, or some inviolable set of ethical principles‚Äìis that pretty much anything else you worship will eat you alive.\n- ==True freedom== requires attention, awareness, and discipline, in order to care and sacrifice for others everyday.\n \u003e The really important kind of freedom involves attention and awareness and discipline, and being able truly to care about other people and to sacrifice for them over and over in myriad petty, unsexy ways every day.\n- [[Permanent Notes/The alternative to freedom is unconsciousness]]\n  \u003e That is real freedom.

Technology companies stood by, ready to become everyone‚Äôs library, memory, personality.\n- The tech industry creates ==consumers== of its leisure and work culture.\n   \u003e The tech industry was making me a perfect consumer of the world it was creating. It wasn‚Äôt just about leisure, the easy access to nice food and private transportation and abundant personal entertainment. It was the work culture, too: what Silicon Valley got right, how it felt to be there. The energy of being surrounded by people who so easily articulated, and satisfied, their desires. The feeling that everything was just within reach.\n- ==Homogeneity== is the cost of erasing ==decision fatigue.==\n    \u003e Homogeneity was a small price to pay for the erasure of decision fatigue.

The abstractions of knowledge work were well documented, but this felt new.

Kaczynski would call these ==\"surrogate activities\": hobbies that work toward artificial goals, but are ultimately unsatisfying.==\n\t- We've constructed fragile, tattered lean-to's of surrogate activities to distract ourselves from the raging destruction outside, but if we continue to stay here, ==there will be nothing left to come back to.==\n- [[Resource Notes/Fakepixels - Newsletter]] **Vol. 58**\n\t- ==Cathachresis:== a statement is so astonishingly wrong that it feels right.\n\t- rhetorician Quintilian gave catachresis a definition: ==a transfer of terms from one place to another when no proper word exists.==\n\t- When we can‚Äôt see the road ahead clearly, we‚Äôre vulnerable to believe in inductive or deductive narratives that reduce the multivariate reality into a logically sound frame with controlled and static variables. Currently, arguments around whether we will forever move away from urban centers, or we will only be working remotely, or we will hang out with friends only in VR, or we will be digitally exhausted demonstrate these qualities, where a few variables render a few versions of the reality. The natural reaction to these narratives is to follow one of these faithfully and to dispel the existence of others. ==The future might actually have both realities interweaving harmoniously without feeling like a transgression.==\n\t- Metamodernism\n\t- When we think about venture building, what we are really considering is the possibilities of these  ‚Äúifs‚Äù and their connections to one another.\n- [[Resource Notes/Wellness Wisdom - Newsletter]] **Vol. 23**\n\t- Optimizing creativity and play as another goal to conquer is also a ==manifestation of an ego== that desires to remain in control and ‚Äúbe the best at x‚Äù.\n\t- Antidote: ==awareness==\n\t- Mr. Money Moustache ==Sweet Spot==\n\t- You can see this in mindfulness/creativity, sports like running, fame, careerbuilding, and more\n\t- Doing an audit of your most extreme experiences, can help you calibrate towards your sweet spot.\n\t- as we become more wise, we‚Äôre able to remain in ==equilibrium== through non-attachment to these peaks and troughs.\n\t- ==The Golden Mean== is a sliding scale for determining what is virtuous.

It‚Äôs gonna be the work, the creative work of millions of people who can each add their own elements to it through content creation and programing and design. And the other way of adding value.\n\t- So it will be a massively participatory medium of a type that we really haven‚Äôt seen yet.\n\t- the critical thing with this effort is to build out not just a 3D platform and to have technical standards, but also a fair economy in which all creators can participate, make money and be rewarded in an economy with both the principles ensuring that customers are treated fairly\n\t- But also one in which companies have the freedom to release their own content and to profit from it.\n\t- much greater engine for economic efficiency than any of the closed systems that exist today. And that we‚Äôd ultimately get to a point where a much higher percentage of the profits go to creators than with any of these other platforms that currently exist. And that when money is going to people who are not creators, it‚Äôs really done through competitive dynamics to ensure that their costs and their profits are very, very reasonable relative to the service they‚Äôre performing.\n\t- I think interconnecting systems is a great way to to to move forward with this. We have XBOX Live, we have Steam, there‚Äôs Nintendo switch, there‚Äôs the PlayStation Network. There are a bunch of these disconnected systems. We should start connecting them together.\n\t- We have several different game engines, each competing really robustly. But we need standards that we can start agreeing on. And there are already some really great ones, like the Pixar USD scene format for interchanging 3D scenes. That‚Äôs one of your standards for materials. We need standards for networking so you can have a multiplayer game in which some people participating are using a client on Unreal engine and some people participating are using a client that‚Äôs built in Unity. Like really being able to create standards for an interoperability so that everybody can have access to this.\n\t- Economic efficiency not only means a better environment for companies to do business, but also means a much fairer environment for consumers.\n\t- First and foremost, these platforms should be truly open to competition. You can come in and say the revenue sharing should be X or Y.\n\t- But really, the core problem here is that the revenue sharing is not determined by free market competition. If the revenue sharing is determined by free market competition, then maybe Apple and Google can charge a premium if their services warrant it. But right now, rates are completely disconnected from any competitive barometer. And so they‚Äôre not honest rates and they‚Äôre distorted and for different reasons.\n- [[Resource Notes/Ortographic media - Article]]\n\t-  [context collapse](http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2013/12/08/coining-context-collapse.html): the standardization of all events, no matter how big or small, delightful or traumatic, to fit the same mashed-together timeline.\n\t-  First, what would it look like for a social media platform to re-establish perspective? To attenuate the strength of signals over distance‚Äînot geographic distance, necessarily, but other kinds? (This is obviously related to my broad interest in adding more negative feedback (https://platforms.fyi/) to these platforms.)\n\t-  Second, in the absence of any such attenuation, I think a practical and healthy thing that any user of social media can do when confronted with a free-floating cube of news is ask: how big is this, really? Does it matter to me and my community? Does it, in fact, matter anywhere except the particular place it happened?\n- [[Resource Notes/The Sociology of Business - Newsletter]]: **Outsider Innovation**\n\t- ==Brand mood== is its aesthetic universe, ideas, values, beliefs, music, the energy of people and places, the crowd it gathers and the crowd that gathers around it.\n\t- ==Art is the opposite of hype.== Art is social and cultural critique, a constant questioning of what‚Äôs going on in the industry and in the world, exploring and preserving one‚Äôs independence while doing so.

(Book)]]\n\t-  we should remind ourselves of how technology's role is to serve us as humans ‚Äî not to limit our humanity or to take advantage of our vices but, rather to make us more human.\n\t-  **CHAPTER 1: INTERFACES ARE FOR INFORMATION**\n\t\t-  The purpose of any interface, regardless of the technology, is to retrieve, decode, modify, and/or distribute information.\n\t\t-  As designers, our job is to consider information first and then the interface as the medium through which to interact with information second. \n\t\t-  Our job is to design communication, or rather to encode information in a way that it can be reliably decoded by another human being. This is different from the purpose of an artist who encodes meaning loosely in such a way that it can be decoded loosely in an infinite number of ways.\n\t\t-  the Latin alphabet is the cornerstone of the interfaces we design\n\t\t-  Throughtout history, each form of information technology, such as the alphabet, has corresponded with a different interface‚Äîor mechanism‚Äîto retrieve, decode, modify and/or distribute that information. Each of these evolutions in information has, in turn, corresponded with changes in human behavior, each unlocking a more effective way for more humans to maximize the utility of information.  \n\t\t-  Each new information technology is often met with resistance and confusion in its early stages (think [TikTok](https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2020/8/3/tiktok-and-the-sorting-hat)) as it takes shape and iterates to become an effective tool. \n\t\t-  Instead of encoding information via language alone, the GUI uses a much richer multilayered approach to simultaneously encode information via language, symbolism, hierarchy, and context to produce an interactive interface.\n\t\t-  GUI the first digital information mechanism that included [affordances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordance) for how a user could utilize the encoded information\n\t\t-  The core purpose of a GUI is not to be pretty, but to be informative\n\t-  **CHAPTER 2: DESIGN AS DANCE**\n\t\t-  Design isn't a march toward something known. Design, instead, is more like a dance‚Äînever done and almost always a little off the first time. \n\t\t-  Design is an exploration of what feels right, making iteration an essential foundation of our discipline.\n\t\t-  Every technology comes with drawbacks but adoption is achieved when the value outweighs the cost.\n\t\t-  The Cyclical Evolution of Information Encoding Methods \u0026 Interface Design\n\t\t\t-  Symbolism and Alphabets\n\t\t\t-  Graphical User Interface\n\t\t\t-  Voice-based Interfaces\n\t\t\t-  Voice + Touch Display\n\t-  **CHAPTER 3: WE INTERFACE BECAUSE WE ARE HUMAN**\n\t\t-  We interface precisely because we are human. Because we are intelligent, because we are social, because we are inquisitive and creative. \n\t\t-  We design our interfaces and they in turn redefine what it means to be human.\n\t ![[Human Hand.png]]\n\t\t- My hope is that as we design our future interfaces we become a little less caught up in the novelty of technologies or aesthetic style and first think a bit more about what future humans we want to be. \n\t-  **FINAL CHAPTER: FUTURE FANTASY OR FUTURE TOMORROW?**\n\t\t-   By knowing the history of technology, information, design, and interfaces we can work toward a more purposeful and intentional future.\n\t\t- We can ask ourselves five questions as we design these interfaces:\n\t\t\t1. How does the interface help us retrieve information?\t\n\t\t\t2. Is it easy to decode the information that was retrieved?\n\t\t\t3. Does the interface allow for easy and clear modification of information?\n\t\t\t4. Does the interface assist in, and clearly declare when it is going to distribute information?\n\t\t\t5. How will this interface redefine what it means to be human?\n- [[Everyone Deserves Great Design (Book)]]\n\t- **1.

This definition was extrapolated to general usage as something told or communicated, whether or not it made sense to the receiver.\n- Information -\u003e communication\n- *\"communication of instructive knowledge.\"*\n- Information = ==data==\n- Information is ==organized data that is made meaningful to a specific audience to serve a purpose.== \n\t- [[Permanent Notes/All useful things should be beautiful]]\n- Information and ultimately communication is in the very ==fabric of our humanity.==\n##### What is an Information Environment?\n- spaces that contain information, and where we interact with them\n- can be both physical and digital\n- can extend from multiple systems -\u003e smaller spaces like a page\n- e.g. library\n\n\n**3 Elements:**\n1. **Content:** information itself\n2. **Consumer:** interacts with content and operates under  a context\n3. **Context:** circumstances of the situation and the environment\n\n##### Information Environments\n![[images/IA Venn Diagram.png]]\n###### Content\n- information in the envrionment = content\n- **Architecture:** the art/practice of designing ==structure==\n- pioneered by architect Richard Saul Wurman\n\t- *\"creating structure to information to yield meaning\"*\n- IA is everywhere around us\n- What isn't IA:\n\t- Visual design\n\t- Software development\n- Good Information Architecture helps people ==understand their surroundings and find what they‚Äôre looking for== - in the real world as well as online.\n\t- **Components of good IA:**\n\t\t- Organization\n\t\t\t- *\"We organize to understand, to explain, and to control. Our classification systems ==inherently reflect social and political perspectives and objectives\"==*\n\t\t- Wayfinding\n\t\t\t- *\"Structure and organization are the about building spaces. Wayfinding about ==about adding doors and windows.\"==*\n\t\t- Labeling\n\t\t\t- *\"The goal of labeling is ==to convey meaning without taking up too much of a user's cognitive space\"==*\n###### Consumer\n- consumer =  user\n- can be actively/passively shaped by user interactions\n- Your job as an architect is to guide them along a path that takes to where they want to go. The architect can teach them how to find their needs, but ==they bring their own goals with them when interacting with the environment.==\n\t- [[Permanent Notes/Everyone always acts in accordance with their internal narratives]]\n###### Context\n- ==relationships== between the environment, the content and the consumer. \n\t- within this, there are goals, constraints and circumstances.\n- e.g. in grocery, context is different for someone trying to lose weight v.s. someone trying to gain\n- e.g. spoilers w/o context\n\n\n### Information Environments + Information Architecture\nGive an example of a **flawed information environment** that you have recently observed. Identify and describe the elements of the space, and recommend a way to make it better.\n\nGuide Questions:\n1. What content is being presented in the environment?\n2. Is the environment digital or physical?\n3. What are the flaws of the space?\n4. What goals can you assume from the users of the space?\n5. What is are the probable circumstances of being in that space? What are possible constraints can be gleaned from the space?\n\nOne flawed information environment I've recently encountered is the Ateneo Integrated Student Information System a.k.a. AISIS. It's a digital environment that, true to its name, presents vital student information, such as the IPS, grades, etc. Students mainly use this to enlist in their classes. However, due to its cluttered and unintuitive interface (i.e. miniscule text, hard to press buttons), the enlistment process ends up becoming stressful and overwhelming for students. One way I'd improve AISIS is refreshing its typography system. For me, the currrent font being used, along with its size (especially for body text) isn't the most readible; as a result, it's easy to miss classes while enlisting. Improving the typography would definitely make enlistment easier.\n\n## Socsci 12\n#sociology\n### Ideas of Modernity\n1. Newer technology\n2. Use of tools to help do work\n3. Exact measurements\n4.

These meanings are what we hope to see, emphasize, feel, experience and practice as we move forward with our lessons in this course.\n\t- Social: This word denotes ==humanity and the relationships we have established and maintained.== Are these relationships life-giving and liberating? Or are these hindering us and others from living a life with dignity and fullness? In this course, we hope to understand the beginnings and developments of these relationships and what roles do we play in them, to assess their impacts to the lives of people, and to discern how we can contribute in sustaining life-giving relations or dismantling those which are oppressive and destructive. In light of this, we will give much attention to the plight of those who are marginalized in and by the society. \n\t- Vision: Vision has an extensive range of meanings too. In Module 0, I used the words: ==plans, goals and dreams interchangeably with vision.== In this course, we hope to create and work on visions/plans/goals/dreams not only for our selves but also for our community, society and world: a SOCIAL VISION. A popular term coined now due to the pandemic is NEW NORMAL and how we should all strive to adapt to it. But, what if instead of saying NEW NORMAL, why not have a BETTER NORMAL in this world? What does our faith tell us to do as we  participate in creating a BETTER WORLD? Vision could also mean what we see, observe and perceive not only with our eyes but also with our hearts and minds. This entails awareness, consciousness, sensitivity and critical understanding of the world we are living in. What and whose lens are we using? Do we make an effort to place ourselves in the shoes of the other or are we too blind and indifferent to do this? This calls for humility and willingness to learn/relearn/unlearn things from various perspectives while keeping a critical stance so that the truth is always promoted. And lastly, this calls for empathy and solidarity- to embrace the causes of those who are neglected and pushed away towards the peripheries in whatever ways and forms.\n- **DEFINITIONS PT. 2:**\n\t- Salvation: The forgiveness of sins and restoration of friendship with God, which can be done by God alone.\n\t- Kingdom of God:\n\t\t- The Catechism of the Catholic Church (CCC) teaches that the coming Reign of God will be a ==kingdom of love, peace, and justice.==[7] Justice is defined as a virtue whereby one respects the rights of all persons, living in harmony and equity with all.[8] The kingdom of God began with ==Christ's death and resurrection== and must be further extended by Christians until it has been brought into perfection by Christ at the end of time.[9]\n\t\t- Catholics do this by ==living the way Christ lived, by thinking the way Christ thought,[7] and by promoting peace and justice.[10]== This can be accomplished by discerning how the Holy Spirit (God) is calling one to act in the concrete circumstances of one's life.[10] Christians must also pray, asking God for what is necessary to cooperate with the coming of God's kingdom.[11] Jesus gathered disciples to be the seed and the beginning of God's Reign on earth, and Jesus sent the Holy Spirit to guide them.[12] Jesus continues to call all people to come together around him[13] and to spread the kingdom of God across the entire world.[14]\n\t\t- However, ==the ultimate triumph of Christ's kingdom will not come about until Christ's return to earth at the end of time.[15]== During Christ's second coming, he will judge the living and the dead. Only those who are judged to be righteous and just will reign with Christ forever.[16] Christ's second coming will also mark the absolute defeat of all evil powers, including Satan.[17] Until then, the coming of the kingdom will continue to be attacked by evil powers as Christians wait with hope for the second coming of their Savior.[18]\n\t- Fullness of Life:\n\t\t- It is a term used to refer to ==Christian teachings on fullness of life.== It is not an organized movement or a unique doctrine, but a name applied to the ==teachings and expectations of the groups and people who follow the teachings.== Abundant life teachings may include expectations of prosperity and health,[1] but may also include other forms of fullness of life when faced with adverse circumstances.[2]\n\t\t- The term \"abundant life\" comes from the Bible verse John 10:10b, \"I have come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.\"[2] \"More abundantly\" means to have a superabundance of a thing. \"Abundant life\" refers to life in its abounding fullness of joy and strength for spirit, soul and body.[3] \"Abundant life\" signifies a contrast to feelings of lack, emptiness, and dissatisfaction, and such feelings may ==motivate a person to seek for the meaning of life and a change in their life.[4]==\n\t- Gospel:\n\t\t- ?\n\t- Love: *(see charity)*\n\t\t- Drawing on the words of St Paul, Christianity traditionally teaches that there are three virtues that are to be prized over all the others. These are called the theological virtues: ==faith, hope and charity== (1 Corinthians 13:13). Charity is the theological virtue by which ==we love God above all things for his own sake, and our neighbour as ourselves for the love of God.== (Catechism of the Catholic Church, n. 1822) Charity is most often translated as ‚Äòlove‚Äô, and its Greek root is agape. This refers to the ==love that God bestows on his creation and the love that we are commanded to show to our neighbours. This love has its source and ultimate goal in God.==\n\t\t- ‚ÄòCharity in truth [‚Ä¶] is the principal driving force behind the authentic development of every person and of all humanity. Love ‚Äì caritas ‚Äì is an extraordinary force which leads people to opt for courageous and generous engagement in the field of justice and peace.‚Äô Benedict XVI, Caritas In Veritate ‚Äì ‚ÄúCharity In Truth‚Äù (2009), paragraph 1\n\t- Justice:\n\t\t- ?\n\t- Evangelization: The ==proclamation of Christ and his Gospel== (from the Greek: evangelion) by word and the testimony of life, in fulfillment of Christ's command.\n\t- Church: The name given to ==the \"convocation\" or \"assembly\" of the People God has called together from \"the ends of the earth.\"== In Christian usage, the word \"Church\" has three inseparable meanings: ==the People that God gathers in the whole world; the particular or local Church diocese; and the liturgical assembly.== The Church draws her life from the word and the Body of Christ, and so herself becomes Christ's body. In the Creed, the sole Church of Christ is professed to be one, holy, catholic, and apostolic.\n\t- Mission:\n\t\t- *Trinitarian missions:* To accomplish the ==divine plan of the triune God for the redemption of humanity==, ==the Son and the Holy Spirit were \"sent\" into the world==: hence the Trinitarian \"missions\" (Latin missus means \"sent\").\n\t\t- *Apostolic mission:* Just as he was sent by the Father, ==Jesus sent his Apostles into the world to continue his own saving mission.== Church as mission: Thus the Church is missionary by its very nature, continuing the mission or work of Christ through the Holy Spirit, according to the plan of God. This apostolic mission of the Church is fulfilled according to their different states of life by the clergy, laity, and religious. Missionary activity is sometimes given in a more specific sense as the work of initial evangelization and establishment of the Church in non-Christian lands.\n\t- Catholic Social Tradition: The Catholic social tradition is a comprehensive term that captures ==the dynamic between Catholic social teaching, thought, and practice.== This dynamic tradition includes a rich history that helps us to see our social responsibilities in the world ‚Äî Scripture, the early church fathers, medieval experience, the various theologians, philosophers, economists, political thinkers, and the countless witnesses throughout the ages. Thus, we need to remind ourselves that the Catholic social tradition did not begin in 1891, but brings us back to the Old Testament and draws upon everything in the life and thought of the church. The social tradition, therefore, is broader and older than the formal social teachings of the church. It provides an intellectual framework and legacy informed by practice and experience from which the more recent (1891 to the present) social teachings draw.\n\n### Catholic Social Teaching\n- set of principles for a just and peaceful  society\n- *\"You shall love your neighbor as you love yourself\"*\n- everyone is made in the image of God, giving them fundamental worth that can't be erased\n- we're  communal and social, just as God is triune \n\n**7 TENETS:**\n1. Every human life has value and dignity\n2. The most basic building block for society to flourish is families\n3. In every society, there are rights and responsibilities\n4. The option for the poor\n5. The dignity of  work and the rights of workers\n6. Solidarity\n7. Humans are stewards of God's creation\n\n- Charity is incomplete unless it is lived out through justice.\n- Justice: giving each one what is rightfully due to them\n- Catholic Social Justice:  doing wht is right to be in right relationship with God, one another, and all of creation\n- difference with charity: it deals with the causes, while charity deals with the consequences\n\n**7 PRINCIPLES:**\n1.  Care for Creation\n2.  Human Dignity\n3.  Family and Community\n4.  Rights and Responsibilities\n5.  Preferential Option for the Poor\n6.  Dignity of Workers\n7.

Leo was acutely aware of the ==poverty of many workers and of the growth in power of socialist movements.==\n- **Quadragesimo Anno**\n\t- 1931\n\t- \"On the Fortieth Year\"\n\t- Pope Pius XI\n\t- ==Dictatorship== is condemned as the dangers of ==fascism and communism== are exposed ‚Äì such as increasing child and female labour.\n\t- This ==mid depression provoked new thinking== as opposed to the previous preoccupation with World War I. The growth of systematic atheism had increased, the modernist crisis arose and there were huge developments in thought. Germany was economically devastated and Russia allowed many of its own people to die ‚Äì justified as necessary for the good of the state.\n- **Mater et Magistra**\n\t- 1961\n\t- \"Mother and Teacher\"\n\t- Pope John XXIII\n\t- It states the need for a ==balance between excessive intervention of the state against the need for state intervention to curb injustices and assist socialisation.== It also goes on to advocate worker participation and ownership and marks the beginning of a focus on international poverty rather than its previous concentration on industrialised countries.\n\t- ==Communism== was still viewed as being a major threat and since World War II there was an increasing concern for poorer nations and international inequalities.\n- **Pacem in Terris**\n\t- 1963\n\t- \"Peace on Earth\"\n\t- Pope John XXIII\n\t- First addressed to ‚Äòall people of goodwill‚Äô and underlines the ==rights and responsibilities of individuals.== This document also ==condemns the arms race and racism== and ==advocates resources== to be shared in the common endeavour for development\n\t- The terrifying threat of ==nuclear war== had become heightened with the Berlin Wall and the Cuban Missile Crisis. In addition, the civil rights movement in the US had also exposed ==divisions of race.==\n- **Gaudium et Spes**\t\n\t- 1965\n\t- \"The Joys and Hopes\"\n\t- Second Vatican Council (Pope Paul  VI)\n\t- This document underlined the need of the church to be ==completely immersed== in human affairs and for the church to share the joys and hopes of people.\n\t- Demonstrates the idea that the church needs to ==‚Äòinterpret the signs of the times‚Äô.== Although this was a document by the Second Vatican Council rather than an encyclical, it was none the less significant. The Vatican II was a pastoral council which firmly showed the significance of the church in the world rather than it being of spiritual concern only, and this was a ‚Äòconstitution‚Äô of Vatican II ‚Äì voted for by a majority of the bishops and was therefore hugely important for Catholic Social Teaching\n- **Dignitatis Humanae**\n\t- 1965\n\t- \"Human Dignity\"\n\t- Another Second Vatican document rather than an encyclical\n\t- Essentially a declaration of ==religious freedom== and the call for all Christians to respect religious freedom, a freedom which must also be permitted by states. The church must be allowed to work freely, but compulsion or force must play no part in a person‚Äôs response to God\n\t- This was one of the most contentious of all of the Vatican documents with much of the initiative coming from the US church favouring ==secularism.== As a result this was opposed (and still is today) by many conservatives favouring the involvement of the church in the state as was seen in Spain and Italy, and as the church had acted up until the early 20th.\n- **Populorum Progressio**\n\t- 1967\n\t- \"The Progress of Peoples\"\n\t- Pope Paul VI\n\t- Pope Paul VI most famously stated that ==‚Äòdevelopment is the new name for peace‚Äô== and he goes onto express dangers of conflict if inequalities grew. The whole area of human development is examined from an ==integral and holistic viewpoint== rather than development just being based on economic factors.\n\t- This was the concern for the signs of the times (in practical terms) as ==the Second Vatican had not fleshed out its ideas for development.== Paul VI had also travelled widely and now international communications were bringing issues such as global poverty into closer proximity due to newer technologies such as television.\n- **Octogesima Adveniens**\n\t- 1971\n\t- \"On the Eightieth Year\"\n\t- Pope Paul VI\n\t- strictly an ==‚Äòapostolic letter‚Äô== rather than an encyclical.\n\t- Further reference is made in this letter to ‚ÄòThe Condition of Labour‚Äô, and Paul VI lists approximately fifteen key issues presenting problems. Paul VI expresses that a variety of responses should be offered as the Christian solution. He also states that ==Christians should be called to action to involve themselves in building a just world by analysing their own realities and devising responses in light of the Gospel.==\n\t-  The South American bishops had met at Medellin three years earlier and their ==themes of structural injustice, the option for the poor, conscientisation and liberatio==n permeate the thinking in this document.\n- **Justicia in Mundo**\n\t- 1971\n\t- \"Justice in the World\"\n\t- Sensitive to the concerns of the developing world, it noted a ==‚Äútremendous paradox‚Äù facing the world contrasting the abundance of resources with the divisions== and ==‚Äúcrisis of solidarity‚Äù facing the world (no. 7). (Solidarity is recognition that we are all one human family.)== The Synod calls for structural change and ‚Äúliberation from every oppressive situation‚Äù facing members of the human family. It notes the failure of development, overspending on armaments, environmental damage, the domination of the economic system by wealthy nations, and the lack of access by poor countries to those things necessary to fulfill their ‚Äúright‚Äù to development.   Calling for solidarity with developing nations, the Synod writes that action by the Church ‚Äúon behalf of justice and participation in the transformation of the world fully appear to us as a ‚Äúconstitutive,‚Äù or essential, dimension of the preaching of the Gospel‚Äù (no. 6).\n- **Evangelii Nunitiandi**\n\t- 1975\n\t- \"On Evangelization in the Modern World\"\n\t- Pope Paul VI\n\t- a ==‚Äúnew evangelization‚Äù== that links social transformation with the proclamation of the Gospel. In light of many social challenges, he calls for an evangelization that transforms both individual believers and social structures. Evangelization is both personal and social, Paul VI writes, and includes the development and liberation of peoples from oppressive structures that cause famine, disease, and poverty; injustices in trade and economic activities; and the oppression of cultural and political colonialism (the control by stronger countries of weaker ones).\n- **Redemptor Hominis**\n\t- 1979\n\t- \"Redeemer of Man\"\n\t- Pope John Paul II\n\t- ==examines human dignity and rights in the light of the mystery of redemption.== He questions ==consumer attitudes and materialism== (valuing material things more than relationship with God and others) that have become more common. He also questions the adequacy of current economic and political structures to address injustices, noting the degradation of the environment and economic structures that lead to inequality. John Paul II notes the connection between violations of human rights and war and the need for true progress based on respect for these rights.\n- **Laborem Exercens**\n\t- 1981 \n\t- \"Through Work\"\n\t- Pope John Paul II\n\t- ==Work== is the central issue of this document; do women and men participate in God‚Äôs creativity and share in its productivity or are they merely cogs? This poses the idea that ==work should increase human dignity as the economy is made for labour and work is the subject of people.== New concepts of solidarity and ‚Äòindirect employer‚Äô emerge strongly in this encyclical.\n\t- Both ==capitalism and Marxism== are criticised. John Paul had lived through the worst excesses of two regimes (Russian Communism and Nazism) which saw the worker as an expendable resource in the interests of the state. He was highly aware that the exploitation of workers continued, especially in poor areas of the world.\n- **The Challenge of Peace**\n\t- 1983\n\t- pastoral letter from the Catholic bishops of the United States\n\t- offers two Christian responses to war: ==just war and nonviolence.==\n\t- The bishops describe numerous conditions that must be present in order for a ==war to be considered just.==  They bishops condemn the use of nuclear weapons against civilian populations, the deliberate initiation of nuclear warfare, and the arms race, and note that nuclear deterrence is only to be used as a step toward progressive disarmament.  Finally, the bishops call for the Church to be involved in efforts for peace.\n-  **Economic Justice for All**\n\t-  1986\n\t-  In this pastoral letter, the Catholic bishops of the United States call for a ==‚Äúnew American experiment‚Äù== for the common good (no. 295) in order to ==address economic issues related to poverty, employment, food and agriculture, and developing nations==\n\t-  In this pastoral letter, the Catholic bishops of the United States call for a ‚Äúnew American experiment‚Äù for the common good (no. 295) in order to address economic issues related to poverty, employment, food and agriculture, and developing nations\n-  **Sollicitudo Rei Socialis**\n\t-  1987\n\t-  \"The Social Concern of the Church\"\n\t-  Pope John Paul II\n\t-  John Paul who had now been Pope for over fifteen years writes this very thoughtful letter in which the terms ==‚Äòstructures of sin‚Äô and ‚Äòoption for the poor‚Äô strongly emerge (from liberation theology).== He goes onto condemn the gap between the rich and poor which can be partially linked to the arms trade.\n\t-  The ==increase in refugees== is a major concern and a result of confrontation. This was written amongst the continuation of the Cold War with the Berlin Wall collapsing later in 1989. This time also saw the ==severe recession== of the mid 1980‚Äôs and gaps between the rich and poor widening with ‚Äòturbo capitalism‚Äô.\n- **Centesimus Annus**\n\t- 1991\n\t- \"The One Hundredth Year\"\n\t- Pope John Paul II\n\t- ==To affirm democracy the excesses of capitalism must be condemned, as well as the ‚Äòidolatry of the market‚Äô and the ‚Äòinsanity of the arms race‚Äô.== Private property is deemed acceptable but for the first time the world‚Äôs goods (including intellectual property) are stated as having a ‚Äòuniversal destination‚Äô.\n\t- ==The Berlin Wall== had just collapsed; arms expenditure globally hovered at around $1,000 billion (one trillion) and there was also the emergence of the super rich individual.\n- **Evangelium Vitae**\n\t- 1995\n\t- \"The Gospel of Life\"\n\t- Pope John Paul II\n\t- Powerful underscoring of the dignity and value of life; John Paul II condemns the ==‚Äòculture of death‚Äô where individual freedom is placed before the rights of others to life== -hence the condemnation of the death penalty, abortion and euthanasia. With very moving words to women who have undergone abortion; ‚Äòdo not give in to discouragement and do not lose hope‚Äô. This presents positive images of the promotion of a ‚Äòculture of life‚Äô where human freedom finds its authentic meaning and a culture of the family is the ‚Äòsanctuary of life‚Äô.\n\t- John Paul II is clearly anxious about the development of ==individualism and its assertion of rights,== especially in advanced societies.\n- **Dues Caritas Est**\n\t- 2004\n\t- \"God is Love\"\n\t- Pope Benedict XVI\n\t- ==the human person‚Äôs ability to love is rooted in the Father‚Äôs love for humankind and the person‚Äôs identity as created in the image of God.== God‚Äôs love manifests itself in Christ, who gives of himself freely for the salvation of humankind.  The call to love neighbor flows from God‚Äôs love for humanity. Benedict XVI locates love for the poor at the center of Catholic life, noting that the ‚Äúexercise of charity‚Äù is one of the Church‚Äôs three ‚Äúessential activities, along with the administration of the sacraments and the proclamation of the word‚Äù (no. 22).  The Holy Father writes that the Church must form the consciences of the laity so that they can work for a just ordering of society. Their political activity should be lived as ‚Äúsocial charity,‚Äù infused with the light of faith and love (no. 29).\n- **Caritas in Veritate**\n\t- 2009\n\t- \"Charity in Truth\"\n\t- Pope Benedict XVI\n\t- Benedict‚Äôs message is directed at a variety of concerns including ==global poverty, injustice and the arms race.== This looks at individuals and organisations through the lens of charity and truth. ==The individual motivation for charity and the concern for authentic human development== are frequent concerns. There are also strong environmental concerns and the concept of ‚Äòintergenerational justice‚Äô is made.\n\t- This now marked forty years since ==Populorum Progressio ‚Äì ‚ÄúThe Progress of Peoples‚Äù (1967).== ==The global economic and banking crisis of 2008== had a major disproportionate effect on the poor of the world, and the issue of the environment had moved up the agenda as better evidence of degradation was consolidated.\n- **Evangelii Gaudium**\n\t- 2013\n\t- The Joy of the Gospel\n\t- Pope Francis\n\t- While not a papal encyclical, Evangelii Gaudium gives particular attention to the ==‚Äòsocial dimension of Evangelisation‚Äô.== The first section, setting the context for sharing the Joy of the Gospel talks of a huge amount of social problems, characterised by Pope Francis as the ‚Äòcrisis of communal commitment‚Äô and touches on the markets, the economy of exclusion, inner city life, spiritual worldliness and consumerism, among other things.\n\t- Francis wrote this document upon the ==invitation of the fathers of the Synod of Bishops,== and published it in commemoration of the end of the Year of Faith.\n\t- **Laudato Si'**\n\t\t- 2015\n\t\t- On Care for Our Common Home\n\t\t- Pope Francis\n\t\t- ==a passionate call to all people of the world to take ‚Äúswift and unified global action‚Äù, particularly in relation to the destruction of the environment.== Pope Francis writes that while humanity has made incredible progress in science and technology, this has not been matched with moral, ethical and spiritual growth. This imbalance is causing our relationships with creation and with God to break down and our hearts to become hardened to the cry of the earth and the cry of the poor. We become arrogant and neglect creation and everyone that is part of it; forgetting what God has entrusted to our care.\n\t\t- Laudato Si‚Äô is the second encyclical of Pope Francis. Since Lumen fidei was largely the work of Francis‚Äôs predecessor Benedict XVI, Laudato Si‚Äô is generally viewed as the first that truly represents Francis‚Äôs outlook.\n### CST Principles\n#### The Dignity of the Human Person\n1. Give one concrete example of how can this principle of Dignity of the Human Person make a positive change in one of your perspectives, values, or lifestyle habits.\nAs I was growing up, I was often told by my family to be wary of street beggars. They said this was because you never know what they do with the money given to them, which could be buying drugs. This principle of Dignity of the Human Person can positively change my perspective for the better by starting to see these people as children of God too. Why should I automatically judge them?\n### The Common Good\n- \"The common good will not be fully realized, but it provides us with a common goal.\"\n- Three things that working toward common good assumes:\n\t- 1.

While there are a few examples i could think of the one that pops to mind is the example in Yoshikawa's \"Musashi\" novel where the protagonist trys to turn a barren land into farmland at first by failing several times to impose what the farm should look like based on experience only to have his work washed away over and over again by torrential rains, eventually he comes to understand on a deeper level both the landscape, the climate and what he is trying to disclose and he manages to turn the land into a rice plot by working with the natural elements instead of against them. It is my interpretation and belief that this same type of discolsing could theoretically be employed on a larger scale by understanding the realities of the violent climate that we are inheriting and building communities that disclose and amplify the inherent resilience of mother nature.\n\u003e We managed to change the climate of an entire planet on ACCIDENT, imagine what we could do with the right INTENTION\n### Ramon\n- connectivity is a human right? tech \u003e other needs?\n- surveillance capitalism\n- is the free gift that is FB reciprocated by the tons of data users provide\n- crucking: to cheat, deceive, defraud\n- https://monthlyreview.org/2014/07/01/surveillance-capitalism/\n### Sasha\n- Poetry is technology\n- \"A poem\"\n- Christian Bok, robopoetics\n- http://ubu-mirror.ch/papers/object/03_bok.\n\u003e It can just be me, but thinking of the end goal and benefit of teaching poetry to AI reduces the practice itself to what Iain said about treating technology without respect and only as a means to optimize human functions.

Start of the year, we had to face a volcano eruption and a global pandemic; now, we've had to deal with political unrest and extreme typhoons. Sprinkle in all the celebrity deaths, and you've got yourself the penultimate VUCA year.\n\nHowever, 2020 has also made me into a better person, personally and professionally (e.g. new careers/ventures, confronting issues). I wouldn't have been able to grow as much if it wasn't for the VUCA world I was living in. With the right mindset, I believe we can turn every crisis into an opportunity. \n\nThat's why I'm glad I got to hear of the VUCA framework, because I believe it's a step towards making a better world. Most of the crisis we've dealt with were because of lack of mindfulness (Hi Duterte, where's the emergency budget!). If we were more prepared, we could've mitigated the effects of 2020. But now that we've experienced the brunt of it, I'm hoping we can learn from our mistakes, and act for our future.\n\n--- \n\n- **Foresight:** the ability to predict what can potentially happen in the future.\n\t- In practicing Foresight, ==we subscribe to the idea that the future is not something we wait for to happen.== Yes, time is not something we control and \"tomorrow\" always becomes \"today\" but ==how that looks like is something we have control over.== We use the tools and skills to shape the future we imagine and create specific steps on how to prepare for whatever is to come.\n\t- Tools:\n\t\t- STEEP Analysis\n\t\t- Futures Triangle\n\t\t- Causal Layered Analysis\n\t- Creativity and foresight are both very practical skills we need as we move into the inevitable Fourth Industrial Revolution.\n\t\t\u003e According to an article written by World Economic Forum in 2016 (Links to an external site.), the Fourth Industrial Revolution should be greatly felt by this year. Admittedly, it's always tricky to think about very technologically advanced concepts/futures/times from the perspective of a developing nation. But this is happening very fast even if the world had to slow down this year. In the Fourth Industrial Revolution, we have to intentionally think about the role and agency of humans in a world where AI and robotics are more likely to be the norm. However, these are not the only things that this new age will bring. ==The challenge for us is to course our definition and production of creativity and innovation towards a more equitable and sustainable space for all.== \n\t- aA\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khjY5LWF3tg\u0026feature=emb_title\n\n![[images/Pasted image 20201208143232.png]]\n\n- Supplementary readings:\n\t- [The Future of Human Work Is Imagination, Creativity, and Strategy](https://hbr.org/2018/01/the-future-of-human-work-is-imagination-creativity-and-strategy)\n\t- [Jobs lost, jobs gained: What the future of work will mean for jobs, skills, and wages](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/future-of-work/jobs-lost-jobs-gained-what-the-future-of-work-will-mean-for-jobs-skills-and-wages#)\n\n#### Tools\n##### Futures Triangle\n- The Futures Triangle, a tool developed by Sohail Inayatullah, is a framework that helps us define a plausible future by defining three parameters: ==the Pull of the future, Weight of history, and the push of the present.== This sets clearer parameters about the plausible future of anything (i.e. Future of Jobs or Future of Education) because it contextualizes creativity and innovation as ==functions of time and space.==\n- **Plausible Future:** a plausible future is a convincing description of a future, which we can hold true, even though this future itself can be factually fallacious. \n\t- https://cspo.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/read_van-der-Helm-Towards-a-Clarification-of-Probability.pdf\n- **Important questions**\n\t- The Pull of the Future\n\t\t- What would be the ideal future for this issue or topic?\n\t\t- Do we have a shared vision of the preferred future and of the futures we want to avoid?\n\t\t- Do we have a shared image of the logic behind how the future gets formed in this specific case, or are there competing logical beliefs?\n\t\t- If we were adrift in a river, where do we end up in the issue?\n\t\t- What tools and resources do we have that can affect the direction and lead us towards that future?\n\t\t- What do we lack to influence change? What are our limits?\n\t\t- Is it possible to impact the futures? Or is it needed at all?\n\t- The Push of the Present\n\t\t- What trends and technologies are changing the future right now?\n\t\t- What things are pushing change forward?\n\t\t- What already known new policies, procedures, laws, budgets, decisions and technologies will start to push changes forward in the near future?\n\t- The Weight of the Past\n\t\t- Who benefits from the status quo or loses if it is changed?\n\t\t- What are the barriers to change?\n\t\t- What is holding us back, or getting in our way?\n\t\t- What are the deep structures that resist change?\n- **How it works:** ==brainstorming tool==\n\t- Select a topic or issue to research and speculate on.

Aspects within society such as family, friends, colleagues, neighbors and the media\n\t-  Technological: New technologies, technology effects, research, development speed, new products and processes, product lifecycles, technology investments, and government research expenditure\n\t-  Economic: Economic growth, inflation, interest rates, exchange rates, taxation, unemployment, income, business cycles, world trade and resource availability\n\t-  Environmental: Material, resources, disposal, emission regulations, energy, transport routes, life cycles, effects of the ozone hole and global warming\n\t-  Political: Policy frameworks, labor market policies, government policies, competition oversight, legislation, political stability, tax policies, trade barriers, security requirements and subsidies\n-  **How this works**\n\t-  Identify your central issue/ topic/ concept (i.e. Future of Schools)\n\t-  Define how each STEEP Category looks like in relation to your central idea.\n\t\t-  For example, the Sociological Analysis of the future of school can look like this (especially in the context of where we are today):\n\t\t\t-  Physical space is no longer necessary, people don't necessarily all live at the same place with the same timezone. Population can grow big because classes are no longer necessarily tied to a classroom. The teacher-student relationship has now shifted because teachers don't have to be present only during class time.\n\t\t- This is basically how it goes -- you extrapolate from the current realities and describe how that category could look like\n\t- Keep going until you've described all your categories.\n\t- Develop/ideate possibilities and innovations specific to your central idea based on your analysis.\n\n![[images/Pasted image 20201208150506.png]]\n\n##### Causal Layered Analysis\n- Causal Layered Analysis (CLA) is a Post-structuralist Futures tool developed by Dr. Sohail Inayatullah. This method works by ==identifying many different levels, and attempting to make synchronized changes at all levels== to create a coherent new future.\n- The CLA has 4 layers: ==Litany, Causes, World View, and Myth/Metaphor.==\n\t- Litany: The surface level description of an issue.\n\t\t- Events\n\t\t- Trends\n\t\t- Problems\n\t\t- ‚ÄúWord on the street‚Äù\n\t\t- Media Spin\n\t\t- Official Positions\n\t- Causes: The systems and structures that perpetuate the litany.\n\t\t- Structures\n\t\t- Inter-Relationships\n\t\t- Systems\n\t\t- Policy analysis/technical explanations/ role of the state and interest groups\n\t- World View: The values and perspectives that uphold the systems.\n\t\t- Culture\n\t\t- Values\n\t\t- How language frames/constrains the issue\n\t- Myth/Metaphor: Immediate visual imagery associated to the litany.\n\t\t- Collective Archetypes\n\t\t- Gut/emotional responses\n\t\t- Visual images\n-  Sources\n\t-  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWwDmp1yY5A\u0026feature=emb_title\n\t-  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImWDmFPfifI\n\n\u003e The CLA is an interesting tool because it show us how the things and issues we see today go beyond the surface level. In fact, a lot of the problems and opportunities we see today did not come from nothing -- ==these are products of the history of mankind.== All of the things we encounter today are rooted to and potentially upheld by myths and metaphors we may unconsciously use to define how we perceive the world. \n\u003e Using the CLA can help us ground our brainstorming process. Whether we're looking for solutions to problems or searching for ways to innovate on anything, we can use this framework to see why the things are the way they are and how we can flip things back to arrive at solutions or concepts that can also be supported by what we already know.\n\n--- \n### A Plausible Future\nIn this exercise, we will be using the Futures Triangle to understand a Plausible future for the central idea you are most curious about. Here's the task:\n\n- Identify the task (i.e. Future of Dining In)\n- Do a quick research on each of the triangle pillars of the Futures Triangle as it relates to your central idea\n- Propose a plausible future for your central idea. This can be in the form of a narrative, bullet points, illustration, video, or podcast. Whatever makes most sense for you.\n\n**FUTURE OF LEARNING**\n- Pillars \n\t- The Pull of the Future\n\t\t- ideal future: learning is decentralized and democratized\n\t\t- futures we want to avoid: a world where information and knowledge is for the select few\n\t\t- how this future gets formed: innovation that informs and inspires people, instead of complicating and obfuscating them. \n\t\t- this can also be used for manipluation\n\t\t- tools and resources we have: products and education. not just those in edtech, but tech in general\n\t\t- what we lack: coorindation. imagine what all these companies could do together instead of pursing their individual goals\n\t- The Push of the Present\n\t\t- trends \u0026 technologies: tech! esp edtech platforms, when everything went online. creator economy also\n\t\t- innovative startup act;  local accelerators and startups in this field (e.g. Kumu)\n\t\t- emerging startup ecosystems\n\t- The Weight of the Past\n\t\t- who benefits from the status quo: those who have money to afford \"elite education\" \n\t\t- barriers/holding us back/structures: profit over purpose; financial maximization value\n- Plausible Future\n\t- A world of embedded education: the practice of educating people through encounters that they already have with systems that exist primarily for non-educational purposes\n\t- thriving creator economy, for education\n\t- more alternate forms of learning: e.g. bootcamps, online courses, become normal. people become more open to them\n- Sources\n\t- https://fakepixels.substack.com/p/fkpxls-special-volume-embedded-education","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T15:56:56.99213622Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2020-12-15":{"title":"2020-12-15","content":"\n# December 15, 2020\n## Theo\n#religion\n### Justice in Scriptures\n- The Conversion of St. Augustine\n- God's Special Revelation in Scripture\n\u003e As one of the special ways in which God reveals himself, ==Scripture== is considered as one of the 4 sources of doing theology, the other 3 being ==Tradition== (which, together with Scripture, form one deposit of Divine Revelation), ==Experience== (which we identified in Module 1 as the starting point of theology and of the Pastoral Circle), and ==Reasoning== (which uses the contributions of philosophy, social sciences, and other disciplines, including their insights on Social Analysis which we consider as the 2nd step of the Pastoral Circle method in Module 1). \n- **Overview of Justice**\n- **Creation**\nNormal\n\u003e On one hand, the insertion of the 1st story of creation, one of the last to be composed, at the beginning of the entire Bible introduces the themes of divine concern for creatures, the dignity of human beings, and the orderly division of creation into different habitats for different creatures, different times for different activities, and the importance of honoring God (during the 7th day or Sabbath day) in difficult times as well as moments of celebration.\n\u003e On the other hand, the 2nd creation story highlights the importance of relationships: God makes all the other creatures in an effort to provide a suitable companion for the human (v. 18). Only another human can offer that companionship, which finds its ultimate expression in marriage. \n\nTheologican\n\u003e At the beginning of the video, Bishop Barron answers the question, \"Why does God create?\" by quoting Vatican I's answer, ==\". . . so as to manifest and share his glory.\" ==\n\u003e However, in the video below, theology professor Fr. Michael Himes, makes an interesting clarification on this answer by Vatican I and suggests a more satisfying answer which is worth listening to and reflecting upon. As you watch, take note of the theological shorthand for that reality which brings the universe into existence.\n- Our Responsibility as \"Images of God\"\n\u003e In this final video related to Creation, let us reflect on our responsibility as people created in the \"image of God,\" a theme that runs throughout the bible, culminating in Jesus Christ as our model of being new human, the one who exemplifies to us what it truly means to be an \"image of God.\"  ==We are called to be a sign and instrument of God‚Äôs love, as individuals, and as a community of persons. We are called to reflect the perfect community of the Trinity in our social relationships.==\n\n![[images/Pasted image 20201215233709.png]]\n\n1. What specific theological view or religious truth conveyed by the 2 stories of creation in Genesis strike you the most?\n3. How does this view/truth broaden my perspective about the nature of justice and the nature of God and all his creation in general?\n\nThe religious truth that struck me the most was that science/philosophy and religion go together. This is because of the assumption that most religious people are unscientific (e.g. vouching for Creation over Big Bang theory). This view broadens my perspective by making me realize that believing in God doesn't necessarily mean you have to restrict your world view. You can help contribute to the world through scientific/philosophical means (we are co-creators after all) while still believing in God.\n\n### Original Sin\n1.  Why is there sin and evil in the world?\nThe Bible teaches that sin and evil come not from God who created everything good, but from the willful disobedience of man who abused his God-given freedom at the dawn of history.\n2. What does ‚Äúoriginal sin‚Äù mean?\n‚ÄúOriginal sin‚Äù can refer to two things:\n‚Ä¢the first ‚Äúoriginating sin‚Äù which brought evil and brokenness into the world; or \n‚Ä¢‚Äúoriginated sin,‚Äù or the actual sinful state into which we are born, the essence of which is the privation of sanctifying grace, and some of whose consequences are evident in the outside  sinful  situation (sin of  the  world),  and  the inner  effect  of  disordered  desires (concupiscence) we all experience within us.\n3. What does Genesis teach about original sin? \nGenesis narrates the primordial account of the ‚Äúoriginating sin‚Äù of Adam and Eve and its consequences for them as well as in the spread of evil in order to account for the evil which we all experience today.\n\n4. What were the practical consequences of the first sin?\nFrom the Genesis narrative, in rebelling against God, the man and the woman destroyed their original harmony with:\n- each other (‚Äúthey realized they were naked‚Äù),\n- others (Cain murdered his brother Abel),\n- the community (Tower of Babel),\n- nature (‚Äúcursed be the ground‚Ä¶‚Äù),\nand incurred death (‚Äúdirt you are and to dirt you shall return‚Äù).\n5. What does Genesis add to many contemporary solutions to our social problems?\nTo today's social science approach to bringing peace, justice, and improved economic conditions, Genesis adds a serious consideration of the presence of SIN, and the ‚Äúconsequent monumental struggle against the powers of darkness which pervades our whole human history‚Äù (GS 37).\nPut simply , effective programs for improving social conditions must face and work to overcome the deeper causes of social evils: our wounded human nature, our inclination to self-centeredness, which Genesis reveals.\n6. What is the connection between original sin and death?\nThe science behind sin - The Boston Globe\nDeath as we know it -  the ultimate test of our lives, shrouded in mystery and thus often a source of deep fear and dread -  is due to sin, not God's intention.  God did not make death nor does he rejoice in the destruction of the living‚Äù Wis. 1:13-14. But with St. Paul, we hold that ‚ÄúChrist won the victory when he rose to life, for by his death he freed us from death‚Äù (1 Cor 15:57; GS 18).\n7. How does Church teaching explain original sin? \nThe Church clarifies that we do not inherit Adam‚Äôs personal sin, but its consequences, that is that as members of the human race, we are born deprived of sanctifying grace, into the sinful condition in the world with our weakened human nature resulting from his sin.\n8. What is meant by ‚Äúconcupiscence‚Äù?\nConcupiscence is that deep-seated disorder in our appetites and drives that is the root-cause of many of our personal and social sins; through God‚Äôs redeeming grace we are strengthened to overcome this disorder within us.\n9. What is meant by ‚Äúcapital sins‚Äù?\nCapital or ‚Äúroot sins‚Äù are basic evil inclinations or disvalues (pride, lust, anger, gluttony, envy, covetousness, sloth) which are the origin of many sinful thoughts, words or deeds. They manifest the evil tendencies within each of us which are the effect of original sin.\n10. How does Baptism ‚Äútake away original sin‚Äù?\nBaptism ‚Äútakes away original sin‚Äù by bringing to the baptized the gift of the Holy Spirit, God‚Äôs saving, sanctifying presence. \n\nThe indwelling Holy Spirit in the baptized makes them adopted sons/daughters of the Father, coheirs with Jesus Christ, and incorporates them into his Body the Church.\n\n-----\n\n1. Which biblical event/passage we have covered so far inspires you the most to be just and help create a more just society? Why?\n\n2. How can you apply this passage in your own life and bring about a positive change in your  perspectives, values, or lifestyle.\n\nA biblical event/passage that's definitely inspired me to practice justice is Jesus' sacrifice: taking the wound of humanity just to heal us. It's the most selfless thing I can think of; imagine helping those who hurt you. That's really justice at work. I want to apply this to my own life by practicing this with other people. \"Do unto others what you want done unto you\". E.G. Being gracious with others even if they aren't. Don't treat people the way you're treated. Treat people the way you want to be treated.\n\n--- \n1. Currently, I feel like I am living self-centeredly. My treasure (money) is usually spent on impulse purchases for myself; I donate, but not as much as I have before. Since money is my top priority (worry for finances), this has led me to spending my time and talent in work, even if this detriments me.  \n2. The specific strategies I can use to allot more of my time, talent and treasure to help uplift the lives and conditions of the poor and marginalized are time-blocking, weekly reviews, and budgeting. These all make use of reflection and planning, which can help me be more mindful. By being more mindful, I can allot more of my time, talent, and treasure to those in need.\n3. My immersion sector is PDL: persons deprived of liberty, a.k.a. prisoners. These people may have done personal sins like theft, murder, etc. that landed them in jail. However, there are also social sins like police violence and corruption. On one end of the spectrum, this manifests as innocent people becoming prisoners due to being accused of drug peddling (knowing how Duterte is very anti-drugs). On the other hand, this manifests as unjust alliances between inmates and jail guards through bribery.\n4. These social sins create an environment encouraging personal sins. Thus, they reinforce each other. It becomes an endless cycle of sin.\n5. I believe these social sins can be replaced with life-giving structures by overhauling prisons to encourage rehabilitation over punishment. This in line with the Christian belief that all of us have value, being made in God's image. By treating PDL with the respect they deserve, we can breathe life into a sinful place.","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T15:56:56.99213622Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2020-12-18":{"title":"2020-12-18","content":"\n# December 18, 2020\n## IDS\n[[Resource Notes/Interdisciplinary Approaches to Creation \u0026 Innovation - Class]]\n### Creativity as Revision\n#innovation #creativity \n\n\u003e In the first module, we established how it is a ==natural inclination of all us humans to be creative.== Chapters from The Runaway Species: How Human Creativity Remakes the World and related YouTube videos featuring the book‚Äôs authors helped us appreciate this.\n\n\u003e In the second module, we established that ==creativity is contextualized and that it is bound by space and time.== Tools like STEEP analysis, Futures Triangle, and causal layered analysis equip us with frameworks that allow us to take a subject, object, or phenomenon of interest and identify all the factors that contributed to their coming into fruition, while allowing us to also project into the future and anticipate forthcoming realities.\n\n\u003e In this third module, we will establish that ==creativity is a process of revision.== From this assertion, we can proceed analytically (ie, we can trace back what current realities are an evolution of), and we can also proceed in terms of actualizing the process of creativity (ie, practicing creativity by revising an existing reality).\n\n--- \n### Bending as a mode of revision \n- Bending is a mode of revision that alters the shape and nature of something.

The Fortified Self\n\t- \"I sit with all possible versions of myself\"\n- \"too weird or difficult to proceed towards the sawmill\"\n- Manifest Dismantling: our current notions of productivity aren't creative, but destructive\n- Capitalism appropriating everything\n- Appropriating myself; individualistic part of me selling off everything else\n\u003e ‚ÄúIn a situation where every waking moment has become the time in which we make our living, and when we submit even our leisure for numerical evaluation via likes on Facebook and Instagram, constantly checking on its performance like one checks a stock, monitoring the ongoing development of our personal brand, time becomes an economic resource that we can no longer justify spending on =='nothing.'== It provides no return on investment; ==it is simply too expensive.== This is a cruel confluence of time and space: just as we lose noncommercial spaces, we also see all of our own time and our actions as potentially commercial.‚Äù\n\n\u003e _‚ÄúI hear, see, and smell things in a world where others also hear, see, and smell me. And it takes a break to remember that: a break to do nothing, to just listen, to remember in the deepest sense ==what, when, and where we are.==\n\u003e I want to be clear that I‚Äôm not actually encouraging anyone to stop doing things completely. In fact, I think that ‚Äúdoing nothing‚Äù‚Äîin the sense of refusing productivity and stopping to listen‚Äî==**entails an active process of listening that seeks out the effects of racial, environmental, and economic injustice and brings about real change.** ==I consider ‚Äúdoing nothing‚Äù both as a kind of deprogramming device and as sustenance for those feeling too disassembled to act meaningfully.‚Äù\n\n[[Permanent Notes/Doing nothing is active listening]]\n\n^^^ omg put in Cathexis\n\n\u003e _‚ÄúIn such times as these, ==having recourse to periods of and spaces for ‚Äúdoing nothing‚Äù is of utmost importance, because without them we have no way to think, reflect, heal, and sustain ourselves‚Äîindividually or collectively. ==There is a kind of nothing that‚Äôs necessary for, at the end of the day, doing something. When overstimulation has become a fact of life, I suggest that we reimagine #FOMO as #NOMO, the necessity of missing out, or if that bothers you, #NOSMO, the necessity of sometimes missing out.‚Äù_\n\n[[Permanent Notes/Doing nothing is self-care]]\n\n\u003e \"...'To hear is the physical means that enables perception. To listen is to give attention to what is perceived both acoustically and psychologically.' ==The goal and the reward of [[Permanent Notes/Deep Listening]] was a heightened sense of receptivity and a reversal of our usual cultural training, which teaches us to quickly analyze and judge more than to simply observe.==\n\u003e When I learned about Deep Listening, I realized I had unwittingly been practicing it for a while‚Äîonly in the context of bird-watching. In fact, I‚Äôve always found it funny that it‚Äôs called bird-watching, because half if not more of ==bird-watching is actually bird-listening. (I personally think they should just rename it ‚Äúbird-noticing.‚Äù)== However you refer to it, what this practice has in common with Deep Listening is that observing birds requires you quite literally to do nothing. Bird-watching is the opposite of looking something up online. You can‚Äôt really look for birds; you can‚Äôt make a bird come out and identify itself to you. The most you can do is walk quietly and wait until you hear something, and then stand motionless under a tree, using your animal senses to figure out where and what it is.‚Äù\n\n\n#### Against Creativity\n\u003e *_‚Äú...individualization is a key factor in the contemporary rhetoric of creativity. But the rhetoric demands even more; you have to be a particular ==kind== of individual. Too often it is white, middle-class, straight, fully abled men that are creative and innovative, and all other forms of minority identity are further marginalized.‚Äù_*\n\n\u003e _‚ÄúWhat we see on our social media feeds, the songs we listen to, the information we are presented with, the news sites we visit, the people we meet and the emotions we feel are all beginning to be determined by coded algorithms. While they can bring new things into our consumption patterns (‚Äòyou listen to X, have you heard Y?‚Äô), such creativity serves only to keep us consuming. It is newness to maintain more of the same.‚Äù_\n\n[[Permanent Notes/Creativity enables consumerism]]\n\n\u003e ‚ÄúIf creativity is about the power to create something from nothing, then believing in impossible things is its most critical component. We need to believe that impossible worlds can be reached, if these impossibilities can ever be realized and become lived experiences.‚Äù\n\n[[Permanent Notes/To create something from nothing, we must believe in the impossible]]\n\n\u003e **_‚ÄúThe ‚Äòcreativity‚Äô inherent in politics is more about holding on to power, rather than thinking of new ways of tackling common injustices._**  \n\u003e _This brand of politics has created governments that have systematically failed to stop ‚Äì and in some cases, catalysed ‚Äì inequality, global poverty, environmental degradation and the threat of global nuclear annihilation. As such, people are taking it upon themselves to manage and create new political institutions. If the Arab Spring and the Occupy movement have taught us anything, it‚Äôs that post-2008, political structures are fragile.‚Äù_\n\n\u003e ‚ÄúTo be ==radically creative== is to see connections and potential ways of augmenting each path of resistance with the other. To ==collaborate in opposition== is not easy and requires an agonistic mind set of patience, forgiveness, self-restraint and a great deal of emotional energy. Such things are in very short supply in the current suffocating environment of urban capitalism.‚Äù\n\n#### What are we resisting against?\n1. **The definition of a \"creative\"**\n\t1. Boo stereotypes boo tech bros\n\t2. Being \"creative\" today = trying to fit in a mold, looking and speaking the part\n\t3. Does this mean people who don't fit the mold are less creative?\n\t4. Questions to think about: Who sets the rhetoric? Who defines the parameters? How much agency and power do we yield as privileged citizens of a developing nation? What's our role in defining this identity as we build our own?\n2. **We need to resist the notion that to be creative is to constantly grow and be productive.**\n\t1. We live in a world where everything is commoditized, including time\n\t2. How do we navigate a world where the primary identity of everyone is defined by their level of productivity?\n\t3.

You don‚Äôt look over at someone else‚Äôs race and think, I‚Äôm doing a bad job because you‚Äôre going faster. ==You just focus on your own pace.==\n\n\u003e I have a friend whose communication style I really admire: she‚Äôs clear, emotionally honest, and sets great boundaries. My hope is to be like that in every important emotional encounter: ==to express my needs clearly, to be as honest as possible, and to make it clear what‚Äôs okay and what isn‚Äôt.== This is incredibly freeing, because it means ==I judge myself by my own standard of behavior in every relationship, and not by the other person‚Äôs response.== \n\n\u003e I‚Äôve noticed that most people seem to overly fixate on other people‚Äôs responses: i.e. my partner is upset at me, so I must have been a bad girlfriend. She didn‚Äôt want to go on another date, so I must have been super boring and said the wrong thing. I had a fight with my friend and they‚Äôve been ignoring me since, so I must have overestimated our intimacy...if you want to calibrate accurately, you have to center your own behavior.

Because you don‚Äôt even know what you think.== You don‚Äôt know what is good and beautiful outside of what is culturally dictated to be good and beautiful. We believe that desire is mimetic, but we forget that the people who inspire real desire are always people who are redefining it‚Äîwho give us something new to look at, allow us to escape groupthink. There‚Äôs nothing more powerful than separating signal from noise, spotting a phenomenon no one else has recognized yet. But to do that ==you need your own separate thoughts.==\n\n### feelings first\n\u003e I was going to start this off by telling you an anecdote about my dad. Last weekend my uncle told me that he was struggling to switch from freshwater fishing to saltwater fishing, and wished my dad was still living in Vancouver so he could help out. \"Your dad,‚Äù he said, \"would research everything meticulously, come up with a bunch of theories on how to solve the problem, and then make us test out all his ideas one by one. He‚Äôs great at mapping things out.‚Äù I wanted to use this anecdote to explain where I get ==my need to intellectualize==‚ÄîI‚Äôm just like my dad in that having all the information soothes me like nothing else. But then I realized I‚Äôm just doing the same thing I always do: trying to explain it all away. Developmental psychology, attachment theory, Jungian shadow work‚Äîanything to make it make sense. ==I‚Äôm happiest when I can present a theory, and say here, now I understand.==\n\n\u003e But our feelings point to ==our values and our sensitivities, our pasts and our dreams.== My terror of gaining weight said something meaningful about my relationship with my body, my need to be conventionally attractive. My inability to confront anyone was the result of my deep-seated desire to please. ==Even when emotions don‚Äôt ‚Äúmake sense,‚Äù they have value.==\n\n\u003e ==The personal is political==: our perspectives on the world are first and foremost shaped by our emotional experiences. The sooner we accept that, the sooner we can abandon ego-based pursuits of objectivity and look for actual truth. \n\n\n## Yuan Wang\nWhy you should **work in seasons**: a nature-inspired approach towards personal growth and productivity\n1.

Ivanhoe, Confucian Moral Self-Cultivation*\n\n+ Reliance upon *li* (filial piety) was crucial in the view of prevailing politicla conditions during the time of Confucius. \n+ In contrast to rootless anarchy, *li* offered stabilizing roots to society, sunk deep into the soil of tradition.\n+ Confucius didn't consider himself an innovator. Instead, he considered himself a ==reformer== advocating a return to the old ways and visions of ancient Chinese tradition.\n\n#### Twofold Elements of Ancient Chinese Tradition\n+ **Tao:** the way \n\t+ the way of nature\n\t+ e.g. if you do not interfere with the seed, it will grow\n\t+ revealed by *yi*\n\t+ provides a universal and unwavering standard for judgement\n+ **Te:** virtue\n\t+ human trait/quality considered as a gift or an endowment received by man from Heaven\n\t+ When *tao* acts in man, it becomes *te* or virtue and constitues his very attitude of mind and character\n\n#### The Moral Tao\n\u003e \"Have sincere faith and love learning. Be not afraid to die for pursuing the good way. Do not enter a tottering state nor stay in a chaotic one.

As an example, here are some of my memories: being afraid to cross the street during traffic, and holding my breath to avoid smelling car smoke and sidewalk litter. I acknowledge that I have a lot of privilege, which means that I can afford to have securing housing and ride private transportation. If going outside is already a terrible experience for me, how about those who have to take public transportation or sleep on the streets?\n\nWhat would I do if I was responsible for my city's sustainable development plan? I would towards creating a greener city. Think more trees, trashcans, and improved public infrastructure (e.g. more pedestrian + biker sidewalks). This vision can be implemented by tackling topics like education, housing, and income + work. Even if these don't seem related, I believe they can contribute nonetheless.\n\nFirst, education can be done by teaching citizens the knowledge they need to know (e.g. proper waste segregation). Then, building housing sites for informal settlers will not only improve their health, but also keep the streets safer and cleaner. Finally, jobs can be provided to those working towards a greener city (e.g. garbagemen, construction workers). Overall, doughnut economics made me realize how interconnected everything is.\n\n\n## IDS 192\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T15:56:56.99213622Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2021-09-09":{"title":"2021-09-09","content":"## infinite games\n*What does it mean to be intense?

For digital education, you simultaneously want to replicate the effects of bigger and smaller class sizes.

In this critique, he argues that ==the modern education system is designed to produce confused, passive, dependent, and materialistic children.== The most surprising idea is about literacy rates. Gatto points to a paper released by Senator Ted Kennedy's office that the literacy rate was 98% before the advent of compulsory education. By 1990, that figure had dropped to 91%. Though the argument doesn't quite pass the sniff test, I've long doubted the validity of literacy rate measurements. No matter what, Gatto's speech is worth reading in full.\n\n1. Confusion\n2.

How do they measure development? How can these parameters express problems in society? Which ones might best apply to methodologies related to your sector in NSTP (the respective institutions you're working with in Tubigon, Bohol or Rizal)? What statistics and indicators do you think are important to pay attention to as we discuss sustainable development?\n\n\nFor my group's partner organization, Yamang-dagat Angkop sa Kababaihan at Pang-kabuhayan Inc. (YAKAP), I believe the most appropriate metric to be the \"Capabilities Approach\" by Amartya Sen. According to him, economic freedom should be focused on developing the capabilties of those in need (i.e. marginalized citizens of developing countries). I love this model because it prioritizes increasing freedom over productivity, making it more humane. Since YAKAP is focused on women's livelihood, this approach can be applied through providing education. Being more educated enables them to have more personal freedom.","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T15:56:56.99213622Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2021-09-21":{"title":"2021-09-21","content":"## PHILO13\n#philosophy \n\u003e \"The unexamined life is not worth living\"\n\nRelated to [[Resource Notes/This is Water - Speech]]\n### The goal of ethics\n**Ethics is the quest for the good life.**\n+ A life of excellence is a life of virtue.\n+ Not simply to be pursue excellence or the good life, but to 'take care' or 'be careful' (epimeleisthai)\n### Platonic Moral Theory\n+ **Doctrine of teleology:** everything in the universe has a purpose/function within a hierarchy of purposes/functions.\n\t+ Humans also have a purpose/function, and\n+ **Theory of forms:** there is a world of forms where the eternal and perfect models of the things in the world exist.\n\n### Theory of the Soul\n*The soul existed prior to its union with the body.*\nThe soul is composed of two main aprts:\n+ the rational (reason)\n+ the irrational (spirit and appetite)\n\n### Tripartite Nature of the Soul\nThe soul performs three functions.

The art of living requires knowledge of limits and of measure.\n\t1. applies to appetite\n2. **Courage**: when the energy of will (from the spirit) is kept within limits avoiding rash action, and becomes a trustworthy power in aggressive and defensive behavior\n\t1. applies to spirit\n3. **Wisdom**: when reason remains undisturbed by the onrush of appetites and continues to see the true ideals in spite of the constant changes experienced in the daily life\n\t1. applies to reason\n\n\nThe harmony of three faculties constitutes *justice*, the overarching virtue.\n\nLiving the good life requires reining in your passions.\nFreedom outside of a well-ordered community is *lawlessness.*\n\n### Morality as Recovery of Lost Harmony\n*Only knowledge can produce virtue while ignorance/false knowledge produces evil*\n\n### Moral Evil\nEvil or vice is caused by ignorance/false knowledge when the passions influence reasons to think what appears to bring happiness will do so and cannot.\n+ **Ignorance:** when people are ignorant, their personalities are disorganized because unruly desires/passions control them\n+ **Knowledge:** when people truly know what is good, they will do what is really good\n\t+ False knowledge must be replaced with an accurate appraisal of things or acts and their values...**Awakening**\n\nJustice isn't just political. It's about *soul*.\n### Meaning of Virtue\n+ **Virtue means *knowledge.***\n+ **Virtue is the fulfillment of a unique function.**\n+ **Virtue is *grounded in the nature of the soul.***\n\n+ Virtue is attained only when each part of the soul is fulfilling its own function\n\t+ The appetites and the spirit must be subject to the sovereignty of reason\n\t+ This directs and orders the dynamic capcities according to wisdom\n\n### Twofold Aspects of Man\n+ **non-rational**\n+ **rational**\n\nThe rational aspect is more truly ourselves. We can identify with it rather than with the non-rational aspect, and can recognize that this is appropriate for the kind of being that we are.\n\n### The Ring of Gyges\nThere was a shepherd who was feeding his flock in a fieled when an earthquake happened. After the quake, he saw an opening in the Earth. \nHe went inside and found a bronze horse containing a corpse who was wearing a golden ring. The shepherd took the ring and placed it on his finger.\nHe discovered that the ring gave him the power to become invisible. He then arranged to be chosen as one of the messengers who reported to the king as to the status of the flocks.\nArriving at the palace, he used his new power of invisibility to seduce the queen and murder the king. He then became king of Lydia himself.\n**If there were two such magic rings and the just put on one of them and the unjust the othjer, ==both will behave in the same unjust way.==**\n\n\u003e \"No man can be imagined to be of such an iron nature that he would stand fast in justice.\"\n\nNo man would keep his hands off what was not his own when he could safely take what he liked and in all respects be like a god among men.\n\nA man is just, not willingly or because he thinks that justice is any good to him individually, but of necessity, ==for if anyone thinks that he can safely be unjust, he will be unjust.==\n\nTrue justice pertains more to the true self \"being concerned not with the outward man, but with the inward...==for the just man...sets in order his own inner life...is his own master and his own law, and at peace with himself.==\"\n\nJustice in the end is far nobler than injustice for it serves the telos of man. The end of man is attained when his higher powers are perceived.","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T15:56:56.99213622Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2021-09-27":{"title":"2021-09-27","content":"## WiTech\n1.  For an introduction, please tell us a bit about yourself!\n\nHi! I'm Bianca Aguilar, a junior studying Information Design and Computer Science in Ateneo de Manila University. As a designer and educator, I'm dedicated to cultivating creatives and technologists to be both builders *and* thinkers. I do this by creating learning experiences and writing critical pieces on tech \u0026 design with communities like Developh, User Experience Society, and Reboot. I also do product design and no-code web development for early-stage startups and VC funds. When I'm not working on all this, you can find me training in my home dance studio!\n\n2.  What was your first introduction to technology, and what got you hooked?\n\nAs an artist, I've always found comfort in creating in the web, from animating my own stories to drawing my own characters. Then, when basic HTML + CSS was introduced to me in high school, I found myself wanting more. I ended up teaching myself how to code my own websites from scratch, no matter how ugly they were. I later came across product design during the start of my college; since then, I've constantly been designing and developing. It's also thanks to communities like Developh and User Experience Society that I was able to nurture this passion for creation.\n\nI got hooked on technology because it was so *engaging*. I always find myself challenged, whether it's learning new methods or fixing bugs. The satisfaction you get from figuring something out is like nothing else! At the same time, I was able to indulge in my creativity; the browser became my new canvas. With technology, I felt like I could create anything. \n\n3.  What are your most prized accomplishments in technology?\n\n+ I still can't believe that I was able to become an Adobe Design Circle Scholar this year. The fact that I was chosen to be one of the 10 scholars from thousands of entries over the world is so surreal!\n+ This year, I was able to write two essays that critiqued complex social issues in technology: Make Space for Maintenance, which examines the exploitation of maintenance work, and Fast Food Education, which discusses the dehumanizing nature of edtech programs. I still find writing exruciatingly difficult to do, so I'm proud that I was able to talk about such tricky topics.\n+ It's an honor to teach others, whether it's through large-scale workshops or 1:1 mentorship. Being able to see people grow up-close is priceless.\n\n4.  What is the significance of bridging technology and humanity, and how do you hope we can achieve that?\n\nTechnology is not neutral. The products and platforms we use will always reflect the intentions of their creators. So if they aren't conscious of how their creations can affect their users, people are bound to get hurt. For example, take Facebook's recent scandal, in which a leaked internal report stated that Instagram harms teenagers by fostering their insecurities. People in the humanities ‚Äî sociology, psychology, philosophy, etc. ‚Äî could've seen this from a mile way. This is why I'm always talking about the intersection of tech and the humanities with others; I believe that arming creatives and technologists with this knowledge is crucial to building a better world.\n\n\n5.  What are your tech goals?\n\nCurrently, I'm interested in learning more about Web3. The potential it holds for empowering creators and communities is exciting, and I want to know how to make use of this. I joined the KERNEL fellowship, where I'll be learning and building in the blockchain space for 8 weeks. Let's see where it takes me!\n\nI also aspire to create my own course from scratch, from designing the curriculum to teaching the sessions. For this, I've been exploring topics like knowledge management and critical design. It's a lot of work though, phew. Hopefully, I'll have one done by next year!\n\n6.  What do you think technology and UX design can do for the world?\n\nI believe that technology and design can bring people alive, realizing that they can create the change they want to see in the world. Instead of being passive onlookers, they become active participants. For instance, see how the youth are acting in our current political climate. On their own volition, they make crucial information accessible and advocate for their rights online; they've done this through graphics, websites, protests, and more. \n\n7.  What's the best advice that you can give to other aspiring Filipina tech trailblazers?\n\nEngage your curiousities. We live in a world where we are pressured to follow set paths (e.g. choosing \"safe\" majors and working in \"secure\" companies). But there's value in  keeping off the beaten track, even if it's not inherently obvious. Looking back, I can say that what seemed like terrifying or random decisions (e.g. teaching my first workshop, signing up for an international fellowship, joining a 1-week designathon) ended up being integral to my growth. Cultivate serendipity in your life!\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T15:56:56.99213622Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2021-10-09":{"title":"2021-10-09","content":"## And A Half \n### Lectures\nSee [notes](https://nikkidatlangin.notion.site/SPDP-2021-273ae324f61b44cc957c3fe34b8a85ac)\n###  Food Sovereignty Workshop\nSee [brief](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19rdRP61sQQznRfXkouoFQ8VKZYvNqpuCshsyrz4c_DA/edit), [Intro board](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lt18Cl8=/) and [Miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_l15mrfE=/)\n**Ideas:**\n+ [Why more public libraries are doubling as food distribution hubs](https://theconversation.com/why-more-public-libraries-are-doubling-as-food-distribution-hubs-160674)\n+ [Introduction to Digital Permaculture ‚Äî A World of Solutions](https://medium.com/@sacha.pignot/introduction-to-digital-permaculture-a-world-of-solutions-7aba4cb3c3a5)\n+ [Little Free Pantry](https://www.littlefreepantry.org/home)\n+ [Little libraries become food pantries during COVID-19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEwjN1NT0_0)\n+ ","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T15:56:56.99213622Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2021-10-18":{"title":"2021-10-18","content":"## PHILO13\n#philosophy \n### The Reflection Process\n\u003e ‚ÄúPhilosophy was a mode of existing-in-the-world,which had to be practiced at each instant, and the goal was to transform the whole of the individual‚Äôs life.‚Äù \n\u003e ‚ÄúThus, philosophy was a ==way of life==, both in its exercise and effort to achieve wisdom, for real wisdom does not merely cause us to know:it makes us be in a different way.‚Äù\n\u003e \n\u003e Pierre Hadot, *Philosophy as a Way of Life*\n\n+ **Knowledge imposes responsibility**\n+ People run away from knowledge because they are afraid of the ==enormous gravity of their own freedom==\n\t+ They see freedom us making us liable to freedom rather than ==enabling us to effect renewal==\n\t+ so they forfeit it\n\t\t+ Connected to: [[Permanent Notes/The alternative to freedom is unconsciousness]]\n\t+ What is human is ==to face reality, to constantly and actively seek the truth==, because the demand of our humanity is that we be responsible\n\n#### Four Moments\n1. **Experience**\n\t1. our encounter with the moral theory.

The families came first, then tribes, clans, and eventually whole societies. This clustering facilitated human survival, the satisfaction of basic needs, and the development of communication. Part of such communication was ==the direction and guidance of conduct.==‚Äù \n\u003e \n\u003e\"Conduct contrary to established and approved ways of doing things came to be discouraged and often punished. Prohibitions emerged and certain kinds of conduct were considered wrong. Other kinds were permitted or even expressly required and were deemed right or obligatory. Directives for regulating conduct coalesced over time into rules and principles as settled habits became transformed into customs and practices.‚Äù\n\u003e\n\u003e - Robert Holmes, *Basic Moral Philosophy*\n\n#### Twofold Elements\n+ **Value**\n\t+ *Values ==define the life of peoples and societies== and often provide ==unique identifiers of their culture.== Values predate ethics and form the background of many other moral concepts derived from them principles, norms, laws, virtues.*\n\t+ One of the most important goals of ethics is the ==intellectual analysis of values and value conflicts==, in order to define our duties.\n+ **Duty**\n\t+ The experience of duty is one of the most universal characteristics of human life. There is ==no human society without some rules of conduct== in the form of either prohibitions or obligations.\n\t+ People everywhere consider that some things ought to be done and others avoided. There is a duty to act in certain ways rather than others.\n#### Criterion and Directive\n+ *The primacy of values and the universality of duty in human society form the ==bases for evaluating individual conduct.==*\n+ They also provide the ==framework for making decisions.== It is the aim of ethics to equip us with rational justification for the action that we intend to perform.\n\n### Aquinas\n#### Background\n+ had royal blood\n+ family actively tried to prevent him from becoming a Dominican\n+ His life may be summed up in a few words: praying, preaching, teaching, writing, journeying.\n\n#### Thomistic  Moral Theory\n+ Morality is the quest for happiness.\n+ *Happiness is closely associated with the end or purpose of man.*\n+ To achieve happiness man must fulfill his purpose.\n\n+ **Aristotle:** envisioned a naturalistic morality through which men could achieve virtue by ==fulfilling their natural end==\n+ **Aquinas:** added the ==doctrine of the supernatural end of man== and proposed a double level of morality according to his dual ends\n\t+ Being a Christian, Aquinas taught that human nature has its ==source and ultimate end in God.==\n\t+ Therefore, ==human nature does not contain its own standard of fulfillment. ==\n\t\t+ It is not enough for a man to be simply a man and to exercise his natural functions and abilities in order to achieve perfect happiness. \n\t+ There is a double level of morality corresponding to man‚Äôs natural end and to his supernatural end.\n\n\u003e ‚ÄúDue to its potentiality and openness, the human soul is oriented to become actualized and fulfilled by something else....[N]ot one created good is in a position to fulfill wholly the infinite striving of the human being.... Due to its infinity, human striving cannot come to rest in creation, therefore, ==‚Äòhuman happiness consists in God alone.==‚Äô‚Äù\n\u003e \n\u003e George Wieland, ‚ÄúHappiness,‚Äù *The Ethics of Aquinas*\n\n#### Will\n##### Its Role\n\u003e ‚ÄúMoral acts are willed acts. Where the will does not operate, action has no moral quality whatsoever and falls back into the category of mere natural activity. And even in moral actions, external acts have a moral quality only because they have been commanded by the will. ==Thus moral goodness is located first and foremost in the will.==‚Äù\n\u003e \n\u003e David M. Gallagher, ‚ÄúThe Will and Its Acts‚Äù\n\n+ A person is said to be good or bad simply or morally, on the basis of his will, for ==it is through the will that everything else in the person is used well or badly.==\n+ *Moral action is willed action and morally good action arises from a good will.*\n\n##### Its Nature\n+ *the power or faculty of the soul by which a human agent is in control of his actions*\n+ ==*The will is the power of choice.*==\n\n\u003e ‚ÄúTo have control means that when the person acts, it is possible to act otherwise or not to act at all. This mode of acting is contrasted to the mode of nature in which an agent is determined to act in only one way and cannot do otherwise than it does.‚Äù\n\u003e \n\u003e David M. Gallagher, ‚ÄúThe Will and Its Acts‚Äù\n\n+ **Reason -\u003e Will -\u003e Action**\n+ The full range of appetites seeks to be satisfied and in man the process of satisfaction requires that choices be made between alternatives. ==The choice must be made by the will under the direction of reason.==\n+ If the right choices are made, a person achieves happiness.\n\n#### The Moral Constitution of Man\n+ *The moral constitution of man consists of ==sensuality, appetites, the will, and reason.*==\n+ If a man were moved to act by his appetites in a mechanical or rigorously determined way, ==his acts would not be free and could not be considered from a moral point of view.==\n+ Not only is freedom a prerequisite for an act to be considered moral.\n+ ==*An act is human only if it is free.*==\n+ Freedom is possible where there is ==knowledge of alternatives== and the ==power of the will to make choices.==\n+ Not every choice is correct. The will by itself cannot always make the right move.\n+ *Reason or the intellect* must serve as its guide.\n+ *When the intellect directs the will, it helps the will to choose the good.*\n+ The virtues of the natural man are achieved when the appetites are duly controlled by the will and reason.\n+ The natural end of man is further realized through his ==knowledge of the natural or the moral law.==\n+ **Law -\u003e Reason -\u003e Will**\n+ *When reason is guided by the law, it is able to guide the will properly.*\n+ **The Moral Law -\u003e Reason -\u003e Will -\u003e The Exterior Act**\n\n\u003e Law is a dictate of practical reason for the common good promulgated by one who has care of the community. A supposed law that lacks any of these four criteria is not a genuine law.\n\u003e \n\u003e Coercion is not of the essence of law but ==coercion by threat of sanction is necessary because not all subjects will readily listen to the law.==\n\u003e \n\u003e - Clifford G.

Kossel, ‚ÄúNatural Law and Human Law‚Äù\n\n###### Precepts of the Natural Law\n+ **General:** *Good is to be pursued and evil is to be avoided.*\n+ **Particular:** As being -\u003e as animal -\u003e as rational\n\t+ As being: to preserve the self (e.g. plant)\n\t+ As animal: to propagate the species (e.g. pet)\n\t+ As rational: to tend to the truth (e.g. human)\n\n+ Morality is not an arbitrary set of rules for behavior.\n+ ==*The basis of moral obligation is found in the very nature of man.*==\n+ Although the ‚Äòcommon‚Äô principles of natural law cannot be abolished from the mind as universals, they may be eliminated in a particular action because ==reason may be impeded from applying the universal principle to the particular action by some passion.==\n\t+ E.G. Bad beliefs, evil customs, corrupt habbits\n\n##### The Human Law\n+ *==specific statutes of government== derived from the general precept of the natural law*\n+ ‚ÄúFrom the precepts of the natural law, the human reason needs to proceed to the more particular determination of certain matters.‚Äù\n+ + What gives a rule the character of law is its ==moral dimension, its conformity with the precepts of natural law, its agreement with the moral law.==\n+ *‚ÄúEvery human law has just so much of the nature of law, as it is derived from the law of nature.‚Äù*\n+ If in any point it ==deflects from the law of nature==, it is no longer a law but a ==perversion of law. ==\n\t+ Such a law no longer binds in conscience but is sometimes obeyed in order to prevent an even greater evil. \n\t+ Such command should otherwise not be obeyed.\n+ **Limits of Human Law**\n\t+ Human law can be contrary to divine law.\n\t+ Human law is affected by the uncertainty of human judgment, especially in particular and contingent matters with which morality and law deal.\n\t+ Human law is only about matters that humans can judge, and these are exterior acts of virtue.\n\t+ Human law cannot prohibit or punish all evils.\n+ **Unjust Human Laws**; laws can be unjust in 2 ways:\n\t+ when it is contrary to the human good by violating any of the requirements of law\n\t+ when it violates the divine good or law, such as laws requiring idolatry\n+ E.G. The cardinal and the lawyer\n\n\u003e ‚ÄúWhen a man deserts his private conscience for the sake of public duty, he betrays himself and leads hiscountry by a short road into chaos.‚Äù\n\u003e - *Saint Thomas More*\n\n\u003e ‚ÄúWe must obey God rather than men.‚Äù\n\u003e - Acts 5:29\n\n##### The Divine Law\n+ the law meant to direct man to his supernatural end, available to man through ==revelation== and found in the ==scriptures==\n+ ‚ÄúIt was necessary that besides the natural and the human law, man should be directed to his end by law given by God.‚Äù - Thomas Aquinas\n\n\u003e Divine law is law divinely revealed; this refers to the ==biblical revelation of God‚Äôs directives for human beings==. In fact, there are two divine laws, related not as two species, but as the imperfect to the perfect. It was part of the divine pedagogy to prepare His people through fear of punishment for the new covenant of love poured into our hearts by the Holy Spirit. This law is necessary especially because humans are called to a destiny which transcends the natural order and the human power of achievement; so special directives were needed for the achievement of this end.\n\u003e \n\u003e - Clifford G. Kossel, ‚ÄúNatural Law and Human Law‚Äù\n\n#### Kinds of Acts\n+ **The Human Act** is composed of...\n\t+ **Human Act** (actus humanus): *actions over which man is the master*\n\t\t+ They are properly called human because they are ==rationally controlled== and are ==voluntary.==\n\t+ **Act of Man** (actio hominis): actions not regulated and directed by reason\n\t\t+ They characterize and manifest the ==generic nature of man== or his ==participation in animal life.==\n\n\u003e==Human acts and moral acts are synonymous.== Anything done with deliberation, consciously, voluntarily, counts as a human action. Not every event or activity that can truly be ascribed to a human person counts as a human act. Digesting, ageing, falling when dropped, are called ‚Äòacts of man‚Äô but not human acts. Thinking and all other activities that come under the sway of thought are moral acts, human acts. It is one thing for Socrates‚Äô beard to be growing, it is another for Socrates to grow a beard.\n\u003e \n\u003e - Ralph McInerny, ‚ÄúAquinas‚Äôs Moral Theory‚Äù\n\n#### The Morality of the Act\n*There are 3 factors that determine the morality of an act:*\n+ **Objectum**: *the purpose of the act*\n+ **Finis**: *the intention of the agent*\n+ **Circumstantia**: the factors affecting the act\n\nThe objective of the human act inherently constitutes the reality of the human act while the end of the moral agent and the circumstances of the act enter into or areintegral to the full reality of the human act.\n\n##### Objectum\n+ *specific purpose of the act*\n+ The objective can ==cause a human act to be morally good or evil== even without considering either the end of the moral agent or the circumstances.\n\t+ *bonum in genere*: good of its kind\n\t+ *malum in genere*: evil of its kind\n\n\u003e The central defining feature of an action---which establishes its species, i.e., what kind of action it is---is the objectum. The object or objective is what the person or agent is ==planning to achieve in the immediate sense.== This must be ==differentiated from the larger purpose or end,== which is also relevant to the moral assessment of an act, but does not give the action its specific nature.‚Äù\n\u003e \n\u003e - Daniel Westberg, ‚ÄúGood and Evil in Human Acts‚Äù\n\n###### Morally Neutral Actions\n+ There are certain acts that we do consciously and willingly which cannot be easily classified as good or evil if we judge them only on the basis of their respective objectives.\n+ They can become good or evil, however, if ==we consider the circumstances and the end or motive of the moral agent==. In a concrete case, a particular human act is done for a specific purpose and in a designed manner, at a preferred time and place, and the like. The intention and circumstances of the objectively neutral act are either in conformity or against the norm of reasonable behavior, and so, it is either morally good or morally evil.\n\n\n##### Finis Operantis\n+ The end of the agent can ==provide moral species== to the human act, or it can cause a good act to differ in kind from an evil act.\n+ An act that is *objectively* good can become evil due to the evil intention of the moral agent. The intention or end of the moral agent can cause a human act to be morally good or morally evil of its kind.\n+ **Finis Operis**\n\t+ end of the act\n\t+ exterior purpose of the act\n+ **Finis Operantis**\n\t+ end of the agent\n\t+ interior purpose of the agent\n\n##### Circumstantia\n*contributes ot the goodness/badness of an act*\n![[Pasted image 20211028232407.png]]\n\n+ The circumstances are ==accidents of the human act== since they are outside the essence or specific nature of the human act.\n+ A human act is not fully good, though it is good in its kind and its intended end, ==unless it is done in a proper way, at the right place and time, and even for the right beneficiary.==\n\n##### Acts of the Will\n*Only those actions which proceed from deliberate will are called properly human.*\n+ **Internal**: *the proper acts of the will itself*\n+ **External**: *acts done as commanded by the will*\n\n+ The interior act of the will and the exterior deed ==compose a single act.== \n\t+ There are times when an act that takes place exhibits a double good or evil and sometimes only one. \n\t+ So the moral goodness or evil of an act is sometimes identical from the interior and exterior points of view and sometimes it is different.\n+ For the act to be good, willing a good end is not enough. The object must also be good. Sometimes the exterior act is good because of the good end.\n+ *Does the exterior act increase the goodness or badness of the interior act?*\n\n+ **Repetition:** *Doing an action repeatedly can increase the quality of the will‚Äôs intention.*\n+ **Extent:** *The tenacity in pursuing the goal to conclusion may serve either the goodness or the badness of the act.*\n+ **Intensity:** *Certain actions, as instances of pleasure and pain, make the will more intense or more remiss.*\n\t+ In cases where the will is not deficient but circumstances totally prevent the execution of the act, ==there is no diminishment of the goodness of the will.==\n\n##### The Consequence of an Act\n+ The consequence does not make an action that was evil to be good, nor one that was good to be evil.\n+ Examples\n\t+ If a person gives alms to a beggar who then misuses the gift of money to buy *shabu*, the generosity of the giver is not diminished.\n\t+ If after undergoing torture a prisoner develops the virtue of patience, the torturer is not excused just because his action turned into something good.\n\t+ If the insult hurled by a teacher at his student challenged the latter to do his best, that does not make the insult a good act and the teacher a good man.\n\n###### Foreseen Consequences\n*form part of the goodness or badness of an act*\n+ When the consequences are naturally connected to the action itself, a reasonable person would normally expect such results, ==the agent should be anticipating them==, and these increase the goodness or malice of the action---==the consequences determine the object of the action.==\n\n###### Unforeseen Consequences\n+ When the consequences are rarer or more incidental, and one would not normally anticipate them, then they do not increase the goodness or badness of the act.\n\n##### Modifiers of Voluntariness\n*factors that undermine mastery of the human acts*\n+ **Violence:** *coercion or imposition by an external principle*\n\t+ ‚ÄúWhen external acts are done through force or violence they are involuntary since they are contrary to the will of the person coerced.‚Äù\n+ **Fear:** *caused by threat of evil which can be avoided by adopting certain measures*\n\t+ An act done out of fear is voluntary because ==despite the fear, the act can be considered to emanate from the will and presupposes an interior act of willing.==\n+ **Concupiscence**\n\t+ There are instances, though rare, when concupiscence or the lust for a delightful object or a pleasurable activity is so intense that it overpowers reason and the subsequent act is appropriately considered as an animal act since it does not originate from reason and will but entirely from passion.\n\t+ Since there is no internal act of the will, either of consent or of resistance, then the act is neither voluntary nor involuntary.\n+ **Ignorance:** *privation of the requisite knowledge*\n\t+ Concomitant: *accompanies the doing of an act which would still be done even if there were knowledge prior to the execution of the act*\n\t\t+ Concomitant ignorance does not cause an act to be involuntary because ==it does not result to something that is contrary to the will.==\n\t+ Consequent Ignorance:\n\t\t+ Ignorance of wrong choice, ignorance of universal principles, affected ignorance\n\t\t+ *a consequence of the will because the person deliberately avoids to have knowledge of what he can and should know*\n\t\t+ ==All acts that follow from consequent ignorance ae voluntary.==\n\t+ Antecedent Ignorance: *precedes the act of willing and causes the moral agent to will and then do that which he would not have willed and done*\n\t\t+ Antecedent ignorance causes an act to be involuntary.\n\n\n--- \nApplied to analysis essay\n+ natural law: it is not morally right to bribe lol, because it is unfair, it impedes democracy\n+ human law: law against vote buying\n+ divine law: 10 commandments? not right to steal? or lie? idk search it up\n+ intensity -\u003e In cases where the will is not deficient but circumstances totally prevent the execution of the act, ==there is no diminishment of the goodness of the will.==\n\t+ related to  being hard to refuse bribes kasi baka u might get harassed. or you need to survive\n+ violence and fear as a modifier of voluntariness?\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T15:56:56.99213622Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2021-11-18":{"title":"2021-11-18","content":"## SocSci\n#sociology #education \n\n### Demography and Human Capital\n\n[Demography and Human Capital: Why Education Matters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=td4eO8APvOM)\n\n+ **Demography:** the quantitative study of human populations ‚Äì their size, composition and distribution ‚Äì and the process through which populations change.\n\t+ What makes a population change?

Para bang nabibigo tayong makakita ng isang uri ng ==kaayusan sa ating buhay, lipunan, at mundo== (_dike_ ang salita ng mga Griyego para sa 'kaayusan', na siyang salita rin nila para sa 'katarungan'). Kaya sa halip na magmula sa pagkamangha, maaaring ang ==**karanasan ng** **pagkabigo**== naman ang siyang nag-uudyok sa atin na maghanap ng higit na pag-unawa sa sarili natin o sa daigdig.\n\n\"What truth did we lean on...that might steady her too if her faith should happen to stumble?\" This is the main question tackled in the poem. We reckon with this everyday in a world that seems to never run out of dissapointing experiences: death, disasters, war, and more, all of which seem to happen unexpectedly. To deal with these experiences, we turn to structured truths ‚Äî a.k.a. philosophies ‚Äî for answers (e.g. science and religion). That is why this poem is titled \"Introduction to Philosophy\".\n\n\"Anong katotohanan ang pag-asa namin kung mawala ang paniniwala namin?\" Ito ang pangunahing tanong sa tula. Tinalakay namin ito araw-araw sa isang mundo na punuin ng  karanansan ng pagkabigo: kamatayan, kapahamakan, digmaan, atbp. Para kayahin natin, hahanapin kami ng sagot sa mga katotohanan na may balangkas ‚Äî o pilosoopiya (hal. agham at relihiyon). Ito ang dahilan kung bakit ang pangalan ng tula ay \"Pambungad sa Pilosopiya\".\n\n### Relihiyon \n#### Karanasang Relihiyoso\n- Habang sa unang tingin ay dalawang magkaibang paksa ang mga ito‚Äîkung saan ang **pilosopiya** ay ==pumapatungkol sa **kaalaman at karunungan**==, habang ang **relihiyon** naman ay may ==kinalaman sa **paniniwala at pananampalataya**==‚Äîmay mga pagkakataong hindi madaling ipaghiwalay ang dalawa.\n\t- Hindi sila pwede maghiwalay\n- Ano ba ang halimbawa ng mga ==**relihiyosong tanong**== na maaaring siyang tinutugunan ng iba't ibang relihiyon? Bukod sa kabiguang maunawaan itong \"fact of unequal portions\" na pinagtakahan ng babaeng estudyante sa tula ni Carl Denis, ==ano pa bang mga karanasan ang masasabi nating naghahatid sa tao na magtanong ukol sa kung mayroon bang isang uri ng kaayusan sa buhay ng tao sa daigdig?==\n\nAno itong **\"****nada\"** na tinutukoy ni Hemingway na siyang tila iniiwasan ng nakatatandang serbidor? Paano mailalarawan itong karanasan ng **\"nada\"**? Naranasan mo na ba ito?\n\nIn my perspective, the nada Hemingway is referring to is to the meaninglessness of life: nothing. Is my work important? Will people remember me? Will the world be the same without me? These are the existential questions that constantly occupy our minds, and life will give us no answers for them. People deal with this nothing by being driven to despair or making their own meaning for themselves. I relate to the old men in the story; they cope with this feeling by settling into routines (e.g. drinking in cafes). Routines also calm me because they're under my control, unlike the nothing of life.\n\nSa palagay ko, ang *nada* na tinutukoy ni Hemingway ay ang pagkawala ng kahulugan ng buhay. Mahalaga ba ang ginawa ko? Maalaala ba nila ako? Maging katulad ba ang mundo kung wala na ako? Palaging nasa utak namin ang mga tanong na ito, at walang nagbibigay ng sagot ng buhay namin. Paano tumutugon ang mga tao sa kawalan na ito? Nawawalan sila ng pag-asa, o ginagawa nila ang sariling kahulugan. Ang mga matandang lalaki sa kwento ay nakakaugnay para sa akin; gumawa sila ng karaniwang gawain para kayanin nila ang pakiramdam ng nawalan (hal. nag-iinom sa restawan). Nakakatulong din ang mga karaniwang gawain para sa akin dahil kaya kong kontrolin, hindi katulad ng kawalan ng buhay.\n\nNaniniwala ako sa Diyos, pero nagdududa ako sa relihiyon. Ang sanhi nito ay ang positibong karanasan: nakikita ko na maraming ta sa simbahan ay gumagawa ng masama (hal. ang mga kasalanan ni Apollo Quiloboy at ang diskriminasyon sa mga LGBTQ+, nag-iisang ina, atbp.). Kahit palagi silang magsalita ng kabutihan, iba ang sinasabi ng aksyon nila. Sa palagay ko, sumasalungat ang gawa nila sa mga pagtuturo ng Diyos. \"Kung naunwaan mo, hindi iyan Diyos.\" Dahil dito napagtanto ko na maliit na talagatungkol sa Diyos. Pwede ko bang sabihin na kung anu ang dapat ituro niya? May espirituwal na awtoridad ng mga relihiyon, pero kulang din ang kaalaman nila tungkol sa Diyos. Kahit sino ka, lumampas siya sa inyong abot-tanaw. Kahit hindi ako maunawaan ng Diyos, maniwala ako sa kanya kasi tinutulungan niya akong maging mas mabuting tao. Kung alam ko ng lahat, wala akong gagawin; titigil ako sa pagtatanong at pagsasalamin dahil naging konteto ako sa kaalaman ko. Mananatili akong tao dahil sa prosesong ito.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T15:56:56.99213622Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2022-02-12":{"title":"2022-02-12","content":"## CSCI\n#computerscience\n### Clean Code Checklist\n#### Names\n- [x] Use **intention revealing names**\n- [ ] Avoid **disinformation**\n- [x] Make **meaningful distinctions**\n- [ ] Use **pronounceable names**\n- [ ] Avoid **mental mapping**\n- [ ] **Class names and objects** should have noun/noun phrases\n- [ ] **Method names** should have verb/verb phrases\n- [ ] Pick one word per concept\n- [ ] Don't pun (avoid using the same word for 2 purposes)\n- [ ] Use CS terms where necessary;

SIN, the doing of evil (violating good) is self-destructive\n\t5. \"Doing of evil\" not merely violation of the law, but also destruction or non-realization of a value, and ultimately the human person\n\n\n#### Conscience as PROCESS\n- demanded by the human characteristic\n- even if we want to do good, this isn't always clear. why?\n\t- competing values (e.g. loving v.s. disciplining child)\n\t- ambiguous culture (e.g. seeking revenge obstructs the value of forgiveness)\n\t- incomplete knowledge (e.g. radioactive substances \u0026 the Curie couple)\n\t- changing circumstances (e.g. function of money from medium of exchange to productive good)\n- our hold of the truth is ==fragile, tentative, and not quite absolute==\n- this means that we need to be humble; there's always possibility for error and we need to adapt; ==constantly examine and re-examine our norms== (e.g. age of criminal responsibility)\n- This responsibility is constant and societal\n- What does a **sincere and concrete conscience** mean?\n\t- Sincerity: subjective quality of an individual who searches for the truth\n\t- Correctness: conformity to the objective good, \"almost\" the end-result of sincerity\n- ^ Related\n\t- a sincere conscience always seeks to be correct....always seeking information/enlightenment (v.s. blissful ignorance)\n\t- sincerity may result in \"objective\" correctness, but not always\n- The **Magisterium of the Church** are important in this process (seeking enlightenment)\n\t- long history of teaching and upholding moral values\n\t- trans-cultural character avoids cultural bias/narrowness\n\t- presence of Holy Spirit guides and enlightens the Church\n- What does this process say about the **human person**? (Christian anthropology)\n\t-   It emphasizes the responsibility of the individual to consult and to be open to change; to have a well-formed and well-informed conscience.  \n\t- It underscores the centrality of stable fundamental **values**, as compared to **norms** that concretize and enforce these values.\n\t- ==norms may change; values remain==\n\n#### Conscience as event/judgement\n*concerning the good to be done or the evil to be avoided*\n\n1. **The event itself**\n\t1. When we talk about \"following my conscience\", or that \"my conscience is clear\", etc...it is ==conscience/3== that we refer to\n\t2. It is the concrete judgement of a specific person in a specific situation\n\t3. Therefore, it is not ==universal==\n\t4. Conscience does not legislate norms but it applies the norms to a concrete situation (making it a proximate norm)\n\t5. Judgement of conscience is ==morally infallible==\n\t\t1. does not obviate/exclude objective or factual error\n\t6. What it means that the person acting according to best interests cannot be accused of acting in bad aith, immorally, or commiting a sin\n\t\t1.  Because a person's most ==serious obligation== is to do the good he knows, to follow a well-formed conscience\n\t7. ==Relationship== of Conscience/3 and the Magist of the Church\n\t\t1. the person must follow his consience because the Magist is exercised by human beings who can be ==subject to error==\n\t\t2. ==Autonomy of conscience:== man must make that decision himself; he cannot pass on the responsibility to anyone else\n\t\t\t1. If man is not held responsible, he is treated like a child, not taken seriously, robbed of dignity as a human person\n2. **What does this say about the human person?**\n\t1. \"Man's dignity lies in observing this law and by it he will be judged\"\n\t2. ==Moral infallibility of conscience:== the moral quality of our judgements and the actions that follow thereform is determined by how much they conform with the judgement of a well-formed and well-informed conscience, the good as we know it\n\t3. A person's moral responsibility: to follow a ==well-formed== (honest, sincere) and ==well-informed== (correct) conscience\n\t\t1. Also implies a \"prior\" responsibility that the person must ensure his conscience follows this\n\t\t2. If the conscience is not well-informed, then it does not deserve the obedience that we say we owe it\n\t\t3. What if we emphasize the need for objective good...and trust decision making to external agents...we would end up making a false god, robbing people of their dignity\n\t4. The supremacy of conscience/3 is that the obligation of the human person (see above ^) underscores the ==DIGNITY OF THE PERSON==\n\t\t1. The person must make the judgement himself that he knows is in his conscience, and is ultimately responsible for that decision, and eventually for the kind of person that he will become\n\n#### TL;DR\nwhat conscience says about the \"design\" of the human person\n\t\t1. ==Conscience/1 (the experience of conscience):== indicates that man becomes most fully himself in the doing of the good\n\t\t2. ==Conscience/2 (conscience as process):== emphasizes the responsibility of the person to ensure that the conscience is well-formed (honest, sincere) and well-informed (correct)\n\t\t3. ==Conscience/3 (judgement):== underscores the dignity of the human person. The person decides and is ultimately responsible for the decision that he makes. He cannot pass on that responsibility to anyone else.","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T15:56:56.99213622Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2022-02-15":{"title":"2022-02-15","content":"## Story and Narrative in STEM\n#science #technology #storytelling\n### Propp v.s.

The current administration refuses to abide by this grand narrative of Science and instead, chooses to go against it.

It's stories that tell us how these binaries can be addressed and understood.¬†\n\t+ The narrative structure that every story has also pointed us into the future, teaching us a way to live our lives, where we eventually discover who we are, what it is we need, what it is we have to do to fulfill that need, who will help us along the way, and where it is we have to go before we can truly find ourselves home again.\n+ Thomas says these stories **\"provide us with scripts that help us to navigate and make sense of experiences that we all share as human beings.\"** This idea was reinforced by one of my favorite philosophers, Joseph Campbell:\n\u003e _The idea, since forever, has been that story is a conveyance, a vehicle, to use in order to think, to move forward through life.

One authority says: ‚ÄòIf I had a God whom I could understand, I should never consider him God.‚Äô If you can understand anything about him, it in no way belongs to him, and insofar as you understand anything about him that brings you into incomprehension, and from incomprehension you arrive at a brute‚Äôs stupidity . . . So if you do not wish to be brutish, do not understand God who is beyond words (Meister Eckhart, Sermon 83: _Renovamini spiritu_).*\n\n##### Pagsubok kay Job\n- Ito ang isang halimbawa na baka makatulong sa pag-unawa natin sa sinabi ni Agustin na \"_Si comprehendis non est Deus_.\"\n- Ngunit baka maaari natin muling balikan ang naging karanasan ni Job mula sa punto de bista ng tanong tungkol sa kakayahan natin maunawaan ang Diyos.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GswSg2ohqmA\n\n- Sa **palagay** ni Job--at iyan din ang palagay o **kuro-kuro** ng mga kaibigan niya (_speculation_ ayon sa video) na nakipagtalo sa kanya at sinabing **dapat** may mali siyang ginawa para maranasan niya iyon--sa palagay _nilang lahat_ namuhay si Job sa isang paraan na **hindi dapat** makaranas ng ganoong klaseng paghihirap. \n- **Sa kanilang pag-unawa**, para dumaan si Job sa lahat ng pagdurusang naranasan niya ay tila absurdo, na nagpapakita lamang na hindi talaga makatarungan o hindi talaga mabuti ang Diyos gaya ng inasahan nila.\n- hindi talaga nagpaliwanag ang Diyos sa paraan na inaasahan ni Job. Sa halip na sagutin ang mga tanong ni Job, sa halip na bigyan si Job ng mga malilinaw na dahilan, ang Diyos ang _sumubok_ sa kaalaman at karunungan ni Job.\n\n\u003e Then the Lord answered Job out of the storm. He said: ‚ÄúWho is this that darkens my counsel with words without knowledge? Brace yourself like a man; I will question you, and you shall answer me. **Where were you when I laid the earth‚Äôs foundation? Tell me, if you understand.** Who marked off its dimensions? **Surely you know!** Who stretched a measuring line across it? On what were its footings set, or who laid its cornerstone‚Äîwhile the morning stars sang together and all the angels shouted for joy? Who shut up the sea behind doors when it burst forth from the womb, when I made the clouds its garment and wrapped it in thick darkness, when I fixed limits for it and set its doors and bars in place, when I said, ‚ÄòThis far you may come and no farther; here is where your proud waves halt‚Äô? Have you ever given orders to the morning, or shown the dawn its place, that it might take the earth by the edges and shake the wicked out of it? The earth takes shape like clay under a seal; its features stand out like those of a garment. The wicked are denied their light, and their upraised arm is broken. Have you journeyed to the springs of the sea or walked in the recesses of the deep? Have the gates of death been shown to you? Have you seen the gates of the shadow of death? ==**Have you comprehended the vast expanses of the earth? Tell me, if you know all this**== [(Job 38: 1-18 NIV) (Links to an external site.)](https://biblehub.com/niv/job/38.htm).\n\n- Sa huli, walang nasumbat si Job sa lahat ng tanong ng Diyos maliban dito: ‚ÄúI know that you can do all things; no purpose of yours can be thwarted. You asked, ‚ÄòWho is this that obscures my plans without knowledge?‚Äô Surely ==**I spoke of things I did not understand,** **things too wonderful for me to know**==\" ([Job 42: 1-3 (Links to an external site.)](https://biblehub.com/niv/job/42.htm)).\n- palagay ko iyon ang tunay na '**pagsubok**' kay Job. Ang pagsubok ay ==kung kaya ba niyang **manalig** at **manampalataya** sa isang Diyos na hindi niya kailanman maiintindihan.==\n\n##### Takdang Aralin 1\nAno ang palagay mo sa pahayag ni San Agustin na **\"**_**Si comprehendis non est Deus\"**_? \n\n==A. Kung **naniniwala** ka sa Diyos, anong implikasyon nito sa iyo? Kaya mo bang maniwala sa Diyos na hindi mo mauunawaan? ==\n\nB. Kung **hindi ka naman naniniwala** sa Diyos, ano ang kahulugan nito para sa iyo? Lalo lamang ba nito 'pinapatibay' ang iyong di-paniniwala sa Diyos? \n\nC. Kung **nag-aalangan ka** naman, o **nagdududa** ka kung may Diyos, lalo lamang ba nitong pinahihirapan ka na maniwala nang walang pasubali sa Diyos?\n\nGumamit lamang ng **150-170 na salita** at ingatan ang pagsususlat sa Filipino.\n\n---\n**Outline:**\n1. Intro\n\t1. I believe in God, but I've been struggling to believe in organized religion lately\n\t\t1. E.G. Religious leader Apollo Quiboloy's crimes\n\t\t2. E.G. Christian churches claiming that they're open, but then hate on homophobia\n\t3. Actions speak for themselves\n\t4. These go against what I see, in my perspective, are God's values\n2. Body\n\t1. \"Si comprehendis non est Deus\"; |\"Kung naunawaan mo, hindi iyan Diyos.\"\n\t2. Who am I to be certain of what God's values are? Even organized religions don't fully know what God is.\n\t3. I don't understand how the examples I mentioned above can find themselves aligned with God; bad things happen to good people for no reason; I don't fully understand God in the first place. if I spent a lifetime trying to understand him, I know that I'd never be able to grasp him fully...\n3. Conclusion\n\t1. Despite my lack of knowledge, I still believe in God. Why? Because...if i knew everything, then I would do nothing. I would stop trying to grow as a person because I would be content with what I know. Life is short, and I believe it would be a waste if  I didn't make the  most out of it. I want to be the best version of myself that I can be, and I believe that my faith in  God can help me with this\n\n**Filipino:**\nNaniniwala ako sa Diyos, pero nagdududa ako sa relihiyon. Ang sanhi nito ay ang positibong karanasan: nakikita ko na maraming tao sa simbahan ay ginagawa ng masama (hal. ang mga kasalanan ni Apollo Quiloboy at ang diskriminasyon sa mga LGBTQ+, nag-iisang ina, atbp.). Kahit palagi silang magsalita ng kabutihan, iba ang sinasabi ng aksyon nila. Sa palagay ko, sumasalungat ang gawa nila sa mga pagtuturo ng Diyos.\n\n\"Kung naunwaan mo, hindi iyan Diyos.\" Dahil dito, napagtanto ako na maliit lang talaga ang alam namin tungkol sa Diyos. Pwede ba ako sabihin na kung ano dapat ang patuturo niya? May espirituwal na awtoridad ng mga relihiyon, pero kulang din ang kaalaman nila tungkol sa DIyos. Kahit sino ka, lumampas siya sa inyong abot-tanaw.\n\nKahit hindi ako maunawaan ng Diyos, maniwala ako sa kanya kasi tinutulungan niya akong maging mas mabuting tao. Kung alam ko ng lahat, wala akong gagawin; titigil ako sa pagtatanong at pagsasalamin dahil naging konteto ako sa kaalaman ko. Mananatili akong tao dahil sa prosesong ito.\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T15:56:56.99213622Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2022-02-21":{"title":"2022-02-21","content":"\n## Philo\n#philosophy \n### Paninindigan\n- **Recap:**\n\t+ KURO-KURO: opinyon\n\t+ PANININDIGAN: conviction\n\t+ PANINIWALA: belief\n\t+ PANANAMPALATAYA: faith\n+ Sa madaling salita, heto ang mga 'baitang' o 'hakbang' mula kuro-kuro tungo sa pananampalataya. *(stages/steps/phases)*\n\t+ **KURO-KURO --\u003e PANININDIGAN --\u003e PANINIWALA --\u003e PANANAMPALATAYA**\n#### Sarado sa Hinaharap \n*(closed to the future)*\n\u003e Conviction here refers to a **limit, an end, a bar that has been drawn**.

'Alagaan mo'.==  Sa penomenolohikal na paglalarawan ni Marcel kung gayon, tila ang ibig sabihin pala ng **paniniwala** ay **pagtitiwala**.\n+ Kapag nagtitiwala ka, nagtitiwala ka marahil *(possibility) ***sa** **isang tao (\"to believe in\")**.

I lend myself to X,\" p.134). \n\t+ Ang tunay na pinaniniwalaan at pinagkakatiwalaan mo kung gayon ay ==isang Ikaw na kayang ingatan ang iyong sarili.==\n+ Sino ang siyang pinagkakatiwalaan mo? \n\t+ Madalas, maaaring iyan ang nanay, tatay, o kapatid mo. \n\t+ Maaaring ang mga matatalik mong kaibigan. \n\t+ Habang may iba naman na nagsasabi na may ==buong pagtitiwala sila sa Diyos==\n#### Pagkabigo at Pagtatakda\n*(Failure and Limitation)*\n+ Ngunit hindi maipagkakaila na minsan nabigo na rin tayo ng iba na pinagkatiwalaan natin.\n+ Alalahanin mo ang isang karanasan na binigo ka ng isang tao.\n\t+ Hal. isang kaibigan mo. May ipinagkatiwala ka sa kanya--maaaring ito ay isang lihim o isang pakiusap na gawin ang isang bagay para sa iyo. O maaaring inasahan mo na maging nandoon siya para sa iyo lagi. Ngunit nangyaring noong kinailangan mo siya, wala siya doon. Tila iniwan ka. Hindi niya iningatan ang ipinagkatiwala mo. Para bang inatasan mo siyang gawin o tuparin ang isang bagay para sa iyo, tapos hindi niya ito ginawa o tinupad.\n\t+ Pero paano ba posible mangyari ang madalas masaklap na karanasang ito? Paano ba posibleng mabigo ka ng isang tao, ang masira ang tiwala na binigay mo sa kanya? Kung nakaranas ka ng matinding kabiguan, at kung hindi na nabalik ang dating tiwala mo sa isang tao, baka ganito kasi ang nangyari ayon kay Marcel:\n\t+ I have placed my trust in a certain individual; he betrays me; if I had not established a completely inward relationship with him, or more precisely, with what I took to be him, this disappointment could not have touched me in the strict sense of the term; the fact is, however, that I am affected by it. . . . How was it possible to be disappointed, however? Because ==**my reliance on X had a conditional character**. **I counted on him to fulfill a certain task==,** for example: this task, as it happens, he did not fulfill; **I ascribed a certain determinate quality to him**; the event seems to demonstrate to me that he did not possess it. In sum, ==**I had formed an idea of him** which has now been contradicted and, as it were, nullified== (p.135-136).\n+ Nabibigo ka, halimbawa, ng isang kaibigan dahil habang ipinagkatiwala mo nga sa kanya ang iyong sarili, ==**nagtakda** *(set/established)* ka pala muna ng mga kundisyon sa kanya.==\n\t+ Nagtiwala ka sa kanya dahil sa mga **malilinaw na dahilan**.\n\t\t+ _Dahil_ ==nagpakita na siya **sa nakaraan** ng mga katangian na katiwa-tiwala siya.== _Dahil_ nakita mo na dati na hindi ka niya iniwan; na tinulungan ka niya noong kinailangan mo ito; na hindi niya sinabi sa iba ang iyong mga lihim, atbp.\n\t\t+ Nagbigay siya sa nakaraan ng **mga patunay** na kaibigan nga talaga siya, na maaari mo siyang pagkatiwalaan **ngayon** at pati na rin sa **hinaharap**.¬† At nagpapatuloy kang magtiwala _dahil_ inisip mo na kung ano ang ginawa niya o pinakita niya dati, ay iyon at iyon din sa eksakto at tumpak na paraan ang gagawin at ipapakita niya sa iyo sa hinaharap.\n\t+ Nasaan ang pagbibigay ng kundisyon diyan? Ito: nagtiwala ka sa iyong kaibigan **sa kundisyon na magiging katulad siya ng dati.**               \n\t\t+ Na muli niyang ipamamalas ang mga katangian na tinakda mo na sa kanya. At **mananatili** lamang ang iyong pagtitiwala sa kanya ==**hangga't** hindi ka niya bibiguin, **hangga't** hindi siya magbabago.==\n\t\t+ May mga kundisyon pala ang ganitong klaseng paniniwala; dahil may mga hangganan pa ito, sa isang paraan 'mahina' pa ito. Hindi pa ito 'buo' o walang pasubali.\n\t+ Tunay na **pagpapahiram** lamang ang nangyayari sa paniniwala at pagtitiwala na may mga kundisyon dahil ==kailangang **ibalik** sa iyo ang ipinagkatiwala mo== kapag ito'y nais mo nang hingin. *CREDIT*\n\t\t+ Sa pagpapahiram ng iyong sarili sa iba, inaasahan mo pa rin na ibalik nila ito sa iyo. At kung hindi nila ibalik--kung hindi ka nila iningatan--babawiin mo na ang paniniwala mo, puputulin ang tiwala.\n#### Kuro-kuro pa rin\n+ \"In the light of my previous remarks, however, isn‚Äôt it plain that ==**this vulnerability of my belief** is linked to the residue of opinion still left in it?== (p.136).\"\n+ **Marupok** **pa ang paniniwala o _credere_ na may tumpak na inaasahan mula sa isang Ikaw.**\n\t+ Ang **kundisyunal na paniniwala** ay madaling mawala o bawiin. Wala itong seguridad. Kaya hindi pa '**buo**' ang tiwala na siyang pundasyon ng paniniwala.\n\t+ Nakadepende ang pagpapatuloy (at pagtigil) ng paniniwalang ito sa kung anong posibleng mangyari sa hinaharap. Para bang laging nakabitin. Laging \"_wait and see._\" Gaya ito ng pagsabi sa isang taong mahal mo: \"I love you until further notice . . . .\"\n+ Kaya ang ganitong uri ng paniniwala ay **hindi pa dalisay na pananampalataya**. Sapagkat ayon kay Marcel, ==ang ganap na pananampalataya ay walang mga kundisyon.==\n### Dalisay na Pananampalataya\n#### Lektura\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D13sOKsjBiQ\n**Repetitio**\n+ Pag-ibig = pananampalataya\n+ *Fiat voluntas tua* (thy will be done)\n+ Imahen at kuro-kuro\n+ Paninidigan\n+ Pagtingin sa hinaharap\n+ Kundisyunal na paniniwala\n+ Pagtataya\n\n**Pananampalataya at Pag-ibig**\n+ espasyo\n+ pag-ibig na walang kundisyun: kahit masakit na, kahit hindi ka iniibig\n+ nagtatagal dahil may mga dahilan\n\t+ hal. nagkaktulad ng mga hilig, gawain\n\t+ Dahil XYZ\n+ Hamon: paano kung nagbago na siya?

It is the will of God that should be done in the world, not man's will, because God is the one who created the heavens and the earth, man, and everything else in it that has life. He is sovereign, and we are to submit to Him, not the other way around.\n#### Maikling Pagsusulit\nSa anong paraan katulad ng **walang kundisyon na pag-ibig** ang **dalisay na pananampalataya** ayon kay Marcel?\n\nkung kundisyunal, may hawak ka pa rin sa sarili (may kontrol)\n\"lord i give up my life for you\" song\nGod's plan\n\n1. Thesis: Unconditional love and true faith are alike in the way that you have to let go of control\n2. Bakit?\n\t1. Letting go of control means letting go of your expectations of the one of you love; being open to change; to whatever what happens. The basis of your love/faith should be the core self (pagkatao) of them.\n\t2. By holding people to our expectations, we imprison them. If we can't do this to a person, how can we do this to an all-powerful God?\n\t3. It's terrifying to love/believe in someone this way\n3. Conclusion: Faith is freeing\n\t1. it frees us from being blind (what conviction can do), opens us up to possibilities\n\t2. makes us ready for anything\n\t3. \"Peace and faith are inseparable\"; We are at peace because we trust that our lives are in God's hands\n\n\nThe similarity of both unconditional love and true faith is that you have to let go of control. \n\nWhat does this look like? When you let go of control, you let go of your expectations of the person you love or have faith in (e.g. they should respond to me, be nice and just, etc.). We free them from the conditions we set. This can be like a prison because this prevents others from being different from our concepts of them. Change is a natural part of life, so it's unfair to expect this of people. Thus, how can we expect this of God, who has no limits?\n\nFreeing people of our expectations ends up being freeing for us too. It frees us from blindness by opening us to possibilities: ones where we don't have to be in control all the time. This is why Marcel said \"Peace and faith are inseparable\"; there's no need to worry when you put your whole life in God's hands.\n\nMagkatulad ang walang kundisyon na pag-ibig at ang dalisay na pananampalataya dahil kailangan mo bitawan ng kontrol. \n\nAno ang hitsura nito? Kapag bitawan mo ang kontrol, binibitawan mo din ang pag-asa ng taong minamahal o nananampalataya (hal. dapat sila ay maging mabait at makatarungan, dapat palaging sila tumutugon sa akin, dapat walang masamang mangyari sa akin, atbp.). Makakalaya sila sa mga nakatakdang kundisyon: parang itong kulungan kasi pumipigil ito ng pagkakaiba sa pag-asa mo. Ang pagbabago ay isang bahagi ng buhay, kaya hindi patas paasahin sa mga ibang tao. Sa ganito, paano kami ginagawa ito sa Diyos? \n\nSa pagbibitaw ng kontrol, naranasan din ng kalayaan. Makakalaya kami sa pagkabulag dahil magiging bukas na kami sa iba't ibang posibilidad; paano kung hindi kami pala kailangan palaging bantayan o ingatan?  Kaya sinasabi ni Marcel ng \"Hindi mapaghihiwalay ang kapayapaan at pananampalataya\"; kapag inilagay ka sa buong buhay mo ang hawak ng Diyos, hindi na kailangan mag-alala.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T15:56:56.99213622Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2022-02-28":{"title":"2022-02-28","content":"## Theo 13\n### Man is called to a life of love\n#religion \n**Sources:**\n- Familiaris consortio 11-12\n- Scott Peck, The Meaning of Genuine Love\n#### 2.1 Man is the image of the God of love who created him\n- *Familaris consortio* traces the ==vocation/calling/design of man== to the fact that man is created in the image of God who is love\n\t- Explains how man is at his best when he does good\n- God inscribed in the humanity of man + woman ==the capacity \u0026 responsibility to love==\n\t- Love is not an optional capacity that man can choose to exercise\n\t- Love is a responsibility\n\t- If one chooses not to love, he is choosing to ignore his highest calling: realizing the image of God in whom he was created\n\t\t- A.K.A. path towards self-frustrtion and self-destruction\n- Man is called to love in his unified totality. Man's structure (man is an incarnate spirit ‚Äî a soul expressed in a body, a body informed by immortal spirit), called ==sacramental or symbol-meaning==, is **reflected in his significant acts.**\n\t- Love can't be shown with thoughts alone; this \"spiritual\" reality must be expressed\n\t- The material external expressions are made special and different from all other kisses and flowers because of the meaning behind them\n\t- External expressions do not exhaust the meaning, the spiritual reality\n- This contexts informs how *FC* says that **man must love in unified totality; sexual acts are not only biological**. The sexual act achieves its full human meaning when it is an integral + expressive part of love. ==Meaning = committed love==\n\t- The physical act would be a lie if it wasn't the fruit + sign of total personal self-giving, where we can see the whole person is present\n\n#### 2.2 The Meaning of Genuine Love\n- Working description: **Love is the will to extend oneself for the purpose of nurturing one's own and the other's spiritual growth**\n- 4 important elements/norms of this description of love (to help us discern if we're in a truly loving relationship)\n\t- Teological\n\t- Circular/Growth of Both Persons\n\t- Effort Norm\n\t- Will Norm\n- **Teological:** love is specified by the fruit that it bears, namely human maturity. \n\t- Love can be called genuine based on the ==\"long-term\" effect== it has:\n\t\t- Am I becoming a better person?\n\t\t- As a student/partner/child/orgmate, am I doing my responsibilities?\n\t- Some questions:\n\t\t- Do premarital sexual relations really mean genuine love?\n\t\t- What does a controlling partner indicate (e.g. spend all time together, cut relations with others)?\n\t\t- What effect does my relationship have on my other responsibilities?\n\t\t- There are various forms and degrees of emotional \"blackmail\"\n\t\t- Why can't I have more than one girlfriend? I have enough love!\n- **Circular/Growth of Both Persons:** if the relationship is genuinely loving, it must result in the growth of both persons. \n\t- Can't be loving if one is growing at the expense of another (e.g. professionally)\n\t- A legitimate love of self exists (e.g. a person would like to improve himself, exercise and keep healthy, live his faith) \n\t- Difference between sacrifice and self-sacrifice\n\t\t- **Sacrifice:** giving up something less for something more\n\t\t- **Self-sacrifice:** giving up something more important for something less \n\t\t\t- E.G. Your dignity to avoid fighting\n\t- ==Genuine love requires sacrifice, it excludes self-sacrifice==\n\t- The fallacy of **\"I must learn to love myself first before I can love others\"**\n\t\t- Assumes that love of another is a mere overflow of love of self\n\t\t- Another form: how can I give love if I don't have it?\n\t\t- ==To love is to grow.== To grow is to be responsible for another.\n\t\t- Love of self is possible only through love of another; love of another is possible only through love of self\n\t\t- Why? ==To love myself, I need to extend my ego boundaries; to do this, I must be concerned with and care for another.==\n\t\t- Loving myself and loving another is simultaneous, not sequential\n\t- Genuine love should be self-replenishing, meaningful, fulfilling; it should bring joy and happiness over the long term\n\t\t- E.G. parents find joy in the happiness and success of their children\n\t\t- Counters claims of those who say \"Now is the time to love myself\" after spending all their loves allegedly loving others\n- **The Effort Norm:** a genuinely loving relationship should be driven and fuelled by effort; it should not simply run on emotion.\n\t- If the latter, it's easy to give up and move on to the next pleasurable experience. It cannot last\n\t- Pleasurable relationships are idealized; you are not looking at the person, ==you are focusing on the pleasure you derive from the encounter==\n\t\t- You may even be projecting your idea of her on her instead of getting to really know her\n\t- Consider:\n\t\t- E.G. beginning of relationship is rosy, pleasurable, immediately rewarding. doesn't take that much effort.\n\t\t- Compare relationship based on occasion v.s. one that is pursued E.G. bf-gf in same college v.s. bf-gf in different countries, companies, timezones\n\t- **The Will Norm:** love is not mere feelings; it's also an act of the will, a decision\n\t\t- conventional wisdom and language identify love w/ feelings\n\t\t- but feelings come and go. we cannot control them; therefore, we can't depend on them to be the ==foundation of a stable relationship==\n\t\t- feelings are not human, but ==instincts== until we decide to \"own\" them and act on them\n\t\t\t- E.G. tics, sexual arousal\n\t\t- Genuine love as an act of the will recognizes ==prior responsibilities \u0026 commitments.==\n\t\t\t- You may be drawn towards another person (feelings), but you can say but I am already a committed person and must not give in to the feeling (will, decision)\n\t- **Psuedo-love:** examples of what can be mistaken for genuine love\n\t\t- **Falling-in-love:** emphasizes strong feelings; immortalized in fairy tales, love songs, and poems. Blinds reason + dulls will\n\t\t- **Dependency:** misleading. when someone depends on me, it emphasizes \"being needed\" and relates w/ the \"feeling\" that you are important to the person to whom you are strongly attracted. But this can eventually become unhealthy\n\t\t\t- Dependency here means that one cannot exist/survive without the assurance that he/she is cared for \u0026 supported by the other, even for the most basic things in life\n\t\t\t- Makes relationship taxing, draining, and burdensome\n\t\t\t- In this type of relationship, one is focused only on his/her own, and not the other; ==not interested to grow; the focus is on the self==\n\t\t- **Cathexis:** attachment and care for things, best exemplified in love for pets. We can only love human beings (distinct from pets) because only they ==possess a spirit capable of substantial spiritual growth== \n\t\t\t-  Since communication w/ pets is limited, we end up projecting onto them our own thoughts and feelings \n\t\t\t- ^ This leads to an emotional closeness which may not correspond to reality\n\t\t\t- Pets are only satisfactory if their wills concide w/ ours (e.g. obedience schools)\n\t\t\t- We seek to foster dependency in our pets; we don't want them to grow up and leave. ==We value their attachment, not their independence.==\n\t\t- **Self-sacrifice:** exemplified in the \"martyr\" wife who tolerates all abuse from husband; the more she tolerates, the more she feels she loves her husband.\n\t\t\t- In the process, she \"encourages\" the husband to abuse her and he does not grow, and the martyr wife doles not derive the joy and satisfaction from her relationship\n#### Reflection 2 \n##### Notes\n- siguro i can link to bell hooks and the monk's discussion: https://www.lionsroar.com/bell-hooks-and-thich-nhat-hanh-on-building-a-community-of-love/\n\t- maybe i can link to social justice to self-sacrifice? e.g. dignity for the sake of peace\n\t- link to Ateneo theologicans making a stand\n- i want to talk about the circular/growth norm and trauma...reminds me of parents lol\n- **Remember:**\n\t- focus on 1 point and where you got it\n\t- why is it important\n\t- why did it change the way you view things\n\n###### Quotes\n\n\u003e Perhaps the most common false assumption about love is that ==love means we will not be challenged or changed.== No doubt this is why people who read writing about racism, sexism, homophobia, religion, etc. that challenges their set assumptions tend to see that work as harsh rather than loving.\n\n\u003e Indeed, in this world all efforts to end domination, to bring peace and justice, were spiritual practice.\n\n\u003e ==between self or no-self there is no real separation.== Anything you do for yourself you do for the society at the same time. And anything you do for society you do for yourself also. That insight is very powerfully made in the practice of no-self.\n\u003e \n\u003e I think one of the most wonderful books that Martin Luther King wrote was _Strength to Love_. I always liked it because of the word ‚Äústrength,‚Äù which counters the Western notion of love as easy. Instead, Martin Luther King said that ==you must have courage to love, that you have to have a profound will to do what is right to love, that it does not come easy.==\n\n\u003e We may think that justice is everyone being equal, having the same rights, sharing the same kind of advantages, but maybe we have not had the chance to look at the nature of justice in terms of no-self. That kind of justice is based on the idea of self, but it may be very interesting to ==explore justice in terms of no-self.==\n\n\u003e Sometimes in life all things are not equal, so what does it mean to have justice when there is no equality? A parent can be just towards a child, even though they‚Äôre not equal.\n\n\u003e Justice is possible without equality, I believe, because of compassion and understanding. If I have compassion, then if I have more than you, which is unequal, I will still do the just thing by you.\n\n\u003e You want to be human. Be angry, it‚Äôs okay. But not to practice is not okay. To be angry, that is very human. And to learn how to smile at your anger and make peace with your anger is very nice. That is the whole thing‚Äîthe meaning of the practice, of the learning. ==By taking a look at your anger it can be transformed into the kind of energy that you need‚Äîunderstanding and compassion. It is with negative energy that you can make the positive energy.== A flower, although beautiful, will become compost someday, but if you know how to transform the compost back into the flower, then you don‚Äôt have to worry. ==You don‚Äôt have to worry about your anger because you know how to handle it‚Äîto embrace, to recognize, and to transform it.== So this is what is possible.\n\n\u003e We oppress ourselves by holding on to anger. My students tell me, we don‚Äôt want to love! We‚Äôre tired of being loving! And I say to them, ==if you‚Äôre tired of being loving, then you haven‚Äôt really been loving, because when you are loving you have more strength.== As you were telling us yesterday, we grow stronger in the act of loving.\n\n\u003e ==Fear is born from ignorance.== We think that the other person is trying to take away something from us. But if we look deeply, we see that the desire of the other person is exactly our own desire‚Äîto have peace, to be able to have a chance to live. So if you realize that the other person is a human being too, and you have exactly the same kind of spiritual path, and then the two can become good practitioners. This appears to be practical for both.\n\n\u003e ==The only answer to fear is more understanding.== And there is no understanding if there is no effort to look more deeply to see what is there in our heart and in the heart of the other person. The Buddha always reminds us that our afflictions, including our fear and our desiring, are born from our ignorance. That is why in order to dissipate fear, we have to remove wrong perception.\n\n\u003e They need community to remind them. Sometimes you have a flash of insight, but it‚Äôs not strong enough to survive. Therefore in the practice of Buddhism, ==_samadhi_ is the power to maintain insight alive in every moment, so that every speech, every word, every act will bear the nature of that insight.== It is a question of cleaning. And you clean better if you are surrounded by sangha‚Äîthose who are practicing exactly the same.\n\n\u003e  I think that ==we best realize love in community.==\n\n###### Outline\n\n1. Point that struck me the most: the difference between sacrifice and self-sacrifice\n\t1. Got this from the circular norm, which states that a relationship can only be genuinely loving if it results in the growth of both persons\n\t2. Why is it important? \n\t\t1. It shows me that love requires courage. Why? It doesn't come easy (effort norm), and you need to have a profound will to do what is right to love (will norm)\n\t\t2. I see this relevant to social justice\n2. Expound on example: Discussion between author \u0026 activist bell hooks and Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh on building a community of love\n\t1. Most common false assumption about love: love means we will not be challenged/changed\n\t\t1. 2 unhealthy perspectives:\n\t\t\t1. People who don't want to be challenged: this is what leads people who read social \u0026 cultural criticism, which challenges their set assumptions, as harsh instead of loving E.G. parents, relatives who prefer to remain apolitical/don't like engaging in political discussions\n\t\t\t2. People who are full of anger e.g. movements that call for violence \u0026 resistance; \"loving your enemies\" is seen as weak\n\t2. 1st counter\n\t\t1. Scott peck: Love is ‚Äúthe will to extend one‚Äôs self for the purpose of nurturing one‚Äôs own or another‚Äôs spiritual growth\"\n\t\t2. To love is to grow. To grow is to be responsible for another. Challenge is required for growth.\n\t\t3. E.G. taking a stand. arguing w/ parents \u0026 relatives on politics\n\t\t\t1. If I decide to remain silent for the sake of peace, it would be self-sacrifice. My dignity would be destroyed.\n\t\t\t2. My parents \u0026 relatives wouldn't be able to grow as people. If I truly loved them, I must be concerned for their growth.\n\t3. 2nd counter\n\t\t1. Thich Nhat Hanh: between the self and no-self, there is no separation. Anything you do for yourself you do for society at the same time, and vice versa \n\t\t2. Being angry is very human. But when we hold on to anger, we oppress ourselves.\n\t\t\t1. E.G. negative feelings like discrimination, superiority/inferiority complex lead to suffering\n\t\t\t2. path of self-destruction, because its our responsibility to love\n\t\t\t3. also self-sacrifice: you destroy yourself just to hold on to anger...and in turn destroy others \n\t\t3. Instead, we should transform this anger into understanding and compassion. This is what it means to love your enemies.\n\t\t4. E.G. vaccum of politics; so easy to dehumanize people who don't agree w/ your beliefs (e.g. BBM supports)\n\t\t\t1. this leads to echo chambers online, where everyone is just shouting at each other, but no one is truly listening.\n\t\t\t2. we need to see them as human. listen to them. by loving them, we love ourselves\n3. Overall...Why and did it change the way you view things\n\t1. Love takes courage. You need to be brave to take a stand, but also empathize with others (expand ego boundaries)\n\t2.

Pagkatapos ng dalawang iyan, para bang doon ka lamang maaaring humingi ng **tulong** sa Diyos. \n- Kumbaga, ==nauuna ang pasasalamat at paghingi ng tawad== bago sa 'paghiling' ng isang bagay mula sa Diyos.\n\n#### Limang Elemento ng Dasal\n1. Papuri sa Diyos (*praise*)\n2. Pasasalamat (*thanksgiving*)\n3. Kumpisal at paghingi ng tawad (*confession*)\n4. Sariling intensyon o petisyon (*petition for self*)\n5. Intensyon o petisyon para sa iba (*intercession for others*)\n\n\u003e \"I petition God for things I want or think I need, and I intercede for those for whom I care. I ask God to forgive my sins and to grant me the benefits of forgiveness; and I thank God for what God has given me. If in the context of corporate prayer, the I is replaced by the We, it is only the size of the self that has changed, not its preoccupation with itself, its interests, and its agenda\" (p. 14).\n\n\u003e Kung nagdarasal ka, ano sa pangkaraniwan mong ipinagdarasal ang maaari ngang **batay sa iyong sariling mga pakay, interes, at ninanais**? At ano rin sa iyong mga ipinagdarasal ang masasabing mong **hindi umiikot sa iyong sarili**?\n#### Ano ang Diyos kung ang dasal ay isang kahilingan?\n**Ano ang Diyos kung ang dasal ay nauuwi sa pagsabi ng sariling mga petisyon at kahilingan?**\n1. **Sagutin**: Anong **imahen** o **larawan** ng Diyos ang ipinagpapalagay natin kung nauunawaan natin ang pagdasal bilang pakakataon lamang upang humiling sa Diyos? Ano ang maaaring **implikasyon o epekto** ng pagkakaroon ng ganitong pag-unawa ng dasal sa paniniwala ng isang tao sa Diyos? (80-120 na salita | 3 puntos)¬†  \n2. **Maghanap** at **ipaskil** ang larawan/litrato o _video_ na babagay sa iyong sagot. Ilagay din ang pinagkunan (_source_) ng larawan na ito bilang _caption_.\n\n- Imahen: unlimited credit card\n\t- If we see praying as a time for only requesting for God, the image we'd be seeing of God is of a credit card\n\t- Here's what I learned of credit cards reserved for the elite:\n\t\t- no credit limit\n\t\t- personal concierge who can get you anything you want\n\t- How this applies to God:\n\t\t- we see him as our personal concierge who can get us anything we want\n\t\t- E.G. petition, forgiveness, intercession for others\n- Implikasyon\n\t- we put God in a prison of our concept of him....limited by what is concrete\n\t- we attempt to do this to someone who cannot be defined, who is beyond understanding\n\t- we set ourselves up for dissapointment when we don't get what we want (negatibong karanasan)\n\nIf we see praying as a time only for requesting from God, then our image of God would be a special credit card. For example, the American Express Centurion Black card (which is reserved for the richest) offers users no credit limit and a personal concierge who can get you anything that you want. Similar to this, we see God as a \"card\" for getting all our endless desires: forgiveness, petition, and intercession.\n\nWhen one has this understanding of prayer, they put God in a prison of concrete concepts. However, God cannot be defined this way because he is beyond understanding. So, we end up setting ourselves for disappointment because we don't always get what we want in life. \n\nKung nauunawaan natin ang pagdasal bilang pakakataon lamang upang humiling sa Diyos, ang larawang ipinagpapalagay natin sa Diyos ay isang natatanging *credit card*. Halimbawa, ito ang naghahandog ng American Express Centurion Black card (nakalaan para sa pinakamayaman): walang limitasyon at isang katulong. Katulad nito, nakikita kami ng Diyos bilang paraan para makuha ng gusto natin: paghingi ng tawad at petisyon. \n\nKung ito ang ating pagkakakaunawaan sa pagdasal, nilagay kami ng Diyos sa isang kulungan ng konkretong konsepto. Gayunman, dahil ang Diyos ay walang hanggan, hindi siya nagkakasya sa depinisyon namin. Sa huli, itinakda namin ang aming sarili para sa pagkabigo kasi hindi kami palagi nagkukuha ng gusto natin sa buhay (negatibong karanasan).\n\n\n\n#### Hiling-Tanggap at Tawag-Tugon\n![[Pasted image 20220301134123.png]]\n\n- Kung ang isang dasal ay walang iba kundi ang paghiling na may pagtingin sa sariling mga interes ng nagdarasal, ang dasal ay masasabing nauuwi sa **ekonomikal na lohika** ng **paghiling at pagtanggap**.\n\t- material gyorl\n- **Dalisay na palangain:** pure prayer\n- Tugon ni Kristo:\n\u003e \"Ama, sambahin nawa ang iyong pangalan. Dumating nawa ang iyong kaharian. Bigyan mo kami ng aming pagkain sa araw-araw. At patawarin mo kami sa aming mga kasalanan, sapagkat pinapatawad namin ang bawat nagkakasala sa amin. At huwag mo kaming hayaang matukso.\"\n- Pansinin na nariyan sa \"Ama Namin\" ang mga 'elemento ng dasal' na binanggit ni Westphal\n- At sa pangkaraniwang pag-unawa natin, nalalaman natin na ang isang ama, bilang isang magulang, ay ==nagbibigay-kalinga *(giving care)* sa kanyang mga anak.== \n- Pero pansinin mo lamang na sa tinuro ni Kristo na dasal, ang maaari mo raw hingin/hilingin sa Diyos Ama ay ang ==pang-araw-araw mong makakain.==\n\t- Tahimik ang dasal na ito tungkol sa ibang bagay na ninanais natin para sa ating sarili gaya, halimbawa, ng matataas na grado, na magkaroon ng magandang trabaho, atbp.\n\n##### Ako-Ikaw\n- hindi naman talaga natin 'maiaalis' ang ating sarili sa pagdarasal\n- Ang _akto_ ng pagdarasal ay akto o kilos ng isang **ako**\n\t- kasangkot ang sarili sa kanyang dalangin kahit sa payak *(simple)* na dahilan na nagmumula ito sa kanya\n- nakatuon *(depend/lean?)* at tumutungo *(focus)* pa rin ang mga binibigkas ng siyang nagdarasal sa isang **Ikaw** na dinarasalan. \n- Kaya masasabing may dalawang panig¬†sa istruktura ng dasal: may **ako** na nagdarasal at may dinarasalang **Ikaw**. \n\t- Tanggalin mo ang isa, hindi na dasal iyon\n- Kaya ano ba itong sinasabi ni Westphal na ang dasal ay nagmumula sa isang \"decentered self,\" o sarili na wala sa sentro? \n\t- Hindi ibig sabihin nito na bigla na lamang mawawala o maglalaho ang siyang nagdarasal; kung ganoong ang nangyari, ==Diyos na lang ang matitira doon at wala nang dasal.==\n- Ang tinutukoy lamang ng \"decentered self\" ay ang ==**isang sarili na hindi na makasarili** kung saan ang Diyos ay isinasantabi o nawawala sa dasal.==\n\t- Sa madaling salita, ang \"decentered self\" na ito ay isang **sarili na para-sa-iba**.\n- Ang tawag ng palaisip na si [Emmanuel Levinas (Links to an external site.)](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/levinas/) sa siyang **ibang-iba** sa sarili ay **_l'autre_**\n\t-  ang _l'autre_ o ang **Iba** (_the other_) ay ang siyang labas sa akin (_exteriority_)\n\t- sa ganitong paraan, hindi siya isang bagay na maaari kong gawing obheto ng kaalaman o magsilbing pamamaraan upang makamit ang aking mga hangarin (_irreducible_)\n\t- Ganoon na lamang ang kaibahan niya sa akin na sa isang paraan mas 'mataas' o nakahihigit siya sa akin (_transcendence_).\n\t- Hal. sa iyong kapuwa-tao, nauunawaan mo na siya ay may sariling dangal, kalayaan, at halaga na hindi mo mawawari o masusukat. \n\t\t- Sa ganyang paraan, para kay Levinas ==**walang hangganan** ang _l'autre._== Lumalagpas siya sa iyong pag-unawa at mga kapangyarihan.\n- Tesis ni Westphal: tinatanggal ng isang tao ang kanyang sarili mula sa sentro, at ipinagpapaliban ang kanyang sarling mga interes.\n\u003e \". . . prayer is a deep, quite possibly the deepest **decentering of the self**, deep enough to begin dismantling or, if you like, deconstructing **that burning preoccupation with myself**,\" p.15).\n\n##### Tawag-Tugon\n- Paano magaganap itong pagtanggal sa sentro ng sarili?\n\t- Ito ay sa pamamagitan ng isang karansan ng *kenosis:* nangangahulugan na =='tanggalin ang laman'==; sa kaso na pinag-uusapan natin, ang 'tinatanggal' o isinasantabi ng siyang nagdarasal ay ==ang kanyang mga sariling pagnanais, kahilingan, at kagustuhan.==\n\t- Ang isang pangkaraniwang pagkakataon kung kailan nalilimutan natin ang ating sarili ay kapag ==may pumukaw *(open)* ng ating pansin.==\n\t\t- Maaaring dahil kakaiba ito, hindi mo kilala, hindi mo nauunawaan, o 'di kaya'y ginulat ka gaya ng isang sorpresa na hindi mo inaasahan.\n- Sa ibang pagkakataon, ang pinakasimpleng pangyayari na nilalalayo tayo mula sa ating sarili ay kapag may tumawag sa atin--lalo na kung tinatawag tayo gamit ang ating pangalan. At iyan ang karanasan na pagtutuunan natin ng pansin: ==ang karanasan ng tinawag ka.==\n\n#### Ang Dasal ni Samuel\n##### \"Narito ako, dahil tinawag mo ako\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-F8ZpEdMCQ\n\u003e Here I am, for you called me.

By this holiness, a more human way of life is promoted even this earthly society.\n1. All Christians are called to the fullness of Christian life, not just priests...but ==all Christians==\n2. But not only Christians to the exclusion of everyone else\n3. But the statement was to correct a popular misunderstanding that priests, religious ppl, etc. more than lay, have a more stringent obligation to be holy\n4. Holiness promotes ==a more human way of life== even in this earthly society. Holiness does not take us away from our human responsibilities. Holiness is not escaping or fleeing from the \"world\".\n\n##### 3.1.2 There are various types and duties of life, but only one holiness\nE.G. marriage, religious life, priesthood, single blessedness\n- No \"type\" is \"better\" than another, or a surer way to heaven\n- Christian holiness is not a road parallel to one's ordinary life and work\n- Holiness is achieved in and through ==one's state of life==, through the concrete circs andd events\n\n##### 3.1.3 Holiness\n- CCC: ==holiness is the fullness of Christian life and the perfection of charity==\n\t- by doing the will of the Father in everything (the good I know in conscience if I don't believe in God), Christians may devote themselves wholeheartedly to:\n\t\t-  the glory of God\n\t\t- the service of neighbor\n- The self-realization of the Christian: ==love==, which is found in all of his diverse acts; it is the fulfillment of the law, and includes the fulfillment of other precepts\n\t- Only love can assign man completely to God because ==only love binds the multiplicity of his being into inner unity, dedicating it to God==\n\t- It is in ==loving (and doing the good)== that man attains holiness, that he becomes most  fully himself.\n\n#### Gauudete et exsultate\n- Holiness: often associated with beatified and canonized people...this shouldn't be the case\n- Pope Francis: ==\"saints next door\"==, people struggling against many temptations to lead a  life of love.\n- Holiness is associated with martyrs and virgins and people who  lived difficult and ascetic lives. But it does not have to be. We can be ==‚Äúmiddle class‚Äù saints.==\n- God saves us and makes us holy, not as isolated individuals without any bond between them, but as a ==people in a community. ==\n\t- God draws us to himself taking into account the complex fabric of interpersonal relationships present in a human community.\n- Holiness is present in ==ordinary circumstances==, in the patience of  people‚Äîin parents who raise their children with love, in men and  women who work hard to provide for their families, in the elderly  who do not lose their smile‚Äîthey reflect God‚Äôs presence.\n- The decisive turning points in world history as in one‚Äôs personal life, are substantially codetermined by souls not mentioned in history books.\n\t- We will only find out about those people to whom we owe the decisive turning points in our personal lives on the day when all that is hidden is revealed.\n- There are many stories and testimonies of holy lives, but what we need to do is to discern ==‚Äúmy path, the path to which God is calling me,‚Äù== \n\t- there is not only one but many paths to holiness, the path that will bring out the best in me, in each person. It is not a ‚Äúone size fits all.‚Äù \n\t- God‚Äôs life  is communicated to some in one way and to others in another.\n- Holiness is not withdrawal from the world to spend time in prayer.  We are called to holiness by ==living our lives (including its duties and responsibilities) with love.==\n\t- Be holy by living and caring for your spouse; be holy by laboring with integrity and skill in the service of others; be holy by exercising authority for the common good.\n- A Christian cannot think of ==his/her mission on earth== without seeing it as a ==path to holiness.==\n\t- Each saint is a mission to reflect and embody at a specific moment in history, a certain aspect of the gospel (e.g. Blessed Carlo Acutis)\n- Holiness is nothing else than ==charity/love lived to the full.==  \n\t- ‚ÄúThe measure of our holiness stems from the stature that Christ achieves in us, to the extent that, by the power of the Holy Spirit, we model our whole life on his.\n-   To recognize the word that the Lord wishes to speak to us through one of his saints, we need not get caught in the details. We must look at the ==totality of their lives, their entire journey of growth in holiness.==\n-   It is not healthy to love silence while fleeing interaction with others, to want peace and quiet while avoiding activity, to seek prayer while disdaining service. ==Everything can be accepted and integrated into our life and become part of our path to holiness.==\n\t- Hypocrisy\n- This does not mean ignoring the need for moments of quiet, solitude, and silence before God.\n\t- We all realize the need to stop this ==rat race== and to recover the ==personal space== needed to carry on a ==heartfelt dialogue== with God.\n- Holiness does not take away ==energy, vitality, or joy.==\n\t- Relate to Scott Peck? Love is self-nourishing\n\t- On the  contrary, we will become what the Father had in mind when he  created us, and we will be faithful to our deepest self.\n- ==To depend on God== sets us free from enslavement and leads us to recognize our great dignity.\n\t- enslavement to manmade ideals? like hustle culture\n- To the extent that each Christian grows in holiness, he/she will bear ==greater fruit for our world.==\n- Holiness does not make you less human, since it is an ==encounter between your weakness and the power of God‚Äôs grace.==\n\n### Conclusion and Nexus\n- **Theological anthropology:** call to do the good, call to a life of love, call to a life of holiness.\n- That **man becomes most fully himself** when he does the good, when he loves, when he lives a life of holiness.\n-   **Marriage**, as a committed, loving, responsible relationship is ==one way to live this life==; and for many (most?), it is THE way.\n\t- shouldn't be the case!\n\n### Writing\n#### Notes\n- workaholism? and christianity? \n- Gauudete et exsultate\n\t- Holiness does not take away energy, vitality or joy\n\t- To depend on God sets us free from enslavement, leading us to recognize our great dignity\n\t- Everything can be accepted and integrated with our lives on our path to holiness...nothing has to be neglected (e.g. relationships)\n\t- We all realize the need to stop this ==rat race== and to recover the ==personal space== needed to carry on a ==heartfelt dialogue== with God.\n- Revolutionary Work\n\t- Our creation in the image of God tells us that work is _good_. The effects of sin and the curse remind us that work is _grim_.\n\t\t- E.G. Job well done v.s. painful and frustrating toil\n\t- work as God‚Äôs gift because of our stewardship role in creation\n\t- all vocations are equal and we should not call one as ‚Äúspecial‚Äù\n- **Every Good Endeavor**\n\t- \"...our work can be a calling only if it is reimagined as a mission of service to something beyond merely our own interests. ==Thinking of work mainly as a means of self-fulfillment and self-realization slowly crushes a person.==\"\n\t- ‚ÄúEveryone will be forgotten, nothing we do will make any difference, and all good endeavours, even the best, will come to naught. Unless there is God. If the God of the Bible exists, and there is a True Reality beneath and behind this one, and this life is not the only life, then ==every good endeavour, even the simplest ones, pursued in response to God's calling, can matter forever.==‚Äù\n\t- ‚ÄúSo when we say that Christians work from a gospel worldview, it does not mean that they are constantly speaking about Christian teaching in their work. Some people think of the gospel as something we are principally to ‚Äúlook at‚Äù in our work. This would mean that Christian musicians should play Christian music, Christian writers should write stories about conversion, and Christian businessmen and -women should work for companies that make Christian-themed products and services for Christian customers. Yes, some Christians in those fields would sometimes do well to do those things, but it is a mistake to think that the Christian worldview is operating only when we are doing such overtly Christian activities. Instead, ==think of the gospel as a set of glasses through which you ‚Äúlook‚Äù at everything else in the world.== Christian artists, when they do this faithfully, will not be completely beholden either to profit or to naked self-expression; and they will tell the widest variety of stories. Christians in business will see profit as only one of several bottom lines; and they will work passionately for any kind of enterprise that serves the common good. The Christian writer can constantly be showing the destructiveness of making something besides God into the central thing, even without mentioning God directly.‚Äù\n\t- ‚Äú==all human work (especially excellent work), done by all people, as a channel of God‚Äôs love for his world.== They will be able to appreciate and rejoice in their own work, whether it is prestigious or not, as well as in the skillful work of all other people, whether they believe or not. So this biblical conception of work‚Äîas a vehicle for God‚Äôs loving provision for the world‚Äù\n\t- ‚ÄúBecoming a Christian is a lot like moving to a new country; only it is more profound, because it gives us a new perspective on every culture, every worldview, and every field of work. In the long run, the gospel helps us see everything in a new light, but it takes time to grasp and incorporate this new information into how we live and pursue our vocations. And we can be sure that this ultimate learning experience will never truly end; we are told the angels themselves never tire of looking into the gospel to see new wonders (1 Peter 1:10‚Äì12).‚Äù\n\t- \"[Work] must play its proper role, ==subservient to God.== It must regularly give way not just to work stoppage for bodily repair but also to joyful reception of the world and of ordinary life.‚Äù\n\t- ‚Äúwork is not, primarily, a thing one does to live, but the thing one lives to do. It is, or it should be, the full expression of the worker‚Äôs faculties¬†.¬†.¬†. ==the medium in which he offers himself to God.‚Äù==\n\t- ‚ÄúWork is not all there is to life. You will not have a meaningful life without work, but you cannot say that your work is the meaning of your life. ==If you make any work the purpose of your life‚Äîeven if that work is church ministry‚Äîyou create an idol that rivals God.== Your relationship with God is the most important foundation for your life, and indeed it keeps all the other factors‚Äîwork, friendships and family, leisure and pleasure‚Äîfrom becoming so important to you that they become addicting and distorted.‚Äù\n\n#### Draft?\n**Outline:**\n1. Point that struck me the most: \"Holiness does not take away energy, vitality, or joy...we will become what the Father had in mind when he created us, and we will be faithful to our deepest self.\"\n\t1. Where I found it: Gaudete et exsultate: \"More Alive, More Human\"\n\t\t1. can be linked to \"Activity that Sanctifies\"\n\t2. Why it's important to me: reminds us not to idolize work; relevant today, where hustle culture is prevalent\n2. Expound on Every Good Endeavor: the Christian view of work can serve as the foundation of a thriving and balanced life\n\t1. What happens when we idolize work?\n\t\t1. We get burnt out...energy, vitality, and joy zapped away from us because we neglect our health, relationships, etc.\n\t\t2. Because of selfishness: \"Thinking of work mainly as a means of self-fulfillment and self-realization slowly crushes a person.\"\n\t\t\t1. Work takes a toil on the body...it's not supposed be fulfilling in of itself\n\t\t\t2. Work alone is pointless...our lives are so short\n\t2. Christian view of work will free us from being enslaved by work; this will lead us to true holiness, helping us become our fullest selves...\n\t\t1. We are given purpose\n\t\t\t1. Finding fulfillment in serving God...self-nourishing\n\t\t\t2. With God, every good endeavor can matter forever... (meaning outside our lives)\n\t\t2. the more holy you are, the greater fruit you bear for our world\n\t\t\t1. you are not optimal when you are burnt out\n3. How can I act better?\n\t1. [Work] must play its proper role, ==subservient to God.== It must regularly give way not just to work stoppage for bodily repair but also to joyful reception of the world and of ordinary life.‚Äù\n\t2. Don't neglect your health and the world \n\t\t1. Everything can be accepted and integrated into our life and become part of our path to holiness.\n\t3. Holiness = charity/love lived to the full...we are called to holiness by living our lives (including its duties and responsibilities) with love.\n****\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T15:56:56.99213622Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2022-03-08":{"title":"2022-03-08","content":"## ENE\n- How do narratives persuade us into a particular message/worldview?\n- What tools do creators use for us and sometimes against us?\n\n## Philo\n#religion #spirituality #philosophy \n### Ang Tanong ni Maria\n- hindi siya tinatanong, kaya annunciation\n- \"Magalak ka, ikaw na pinagpala!

The theology revolves around the notion of **God as one who speaks** or, better, as the **One who speaks**; for Mary is no ontotheologian, and God is not so much First Cause as **First Speaker**, the **One whose word is always the beginning**. Here ‚Äò‚Äòbeginning‚Äô‚Äô signifies not a Self-Explanatory Explainer in terms of which everything can be made transparent and intelligible but rather the fact that ==**before I speak**, or **act**, or even **am**, **God has always already spoken**== (p. 21).\n\n- Ayon kay Westphal, matatagpuan raw sa _fiat_ ni Maria ang isang uri ng **teolohiya** at **etika.**\n\t- Ang **teolohiya**, muli, sa payak nitong kahulugan ay sinusubukang bigkasin kung ano ang **malalaman** (galing sa '_logos_') natin sa **Diyos** (_theos_). \n\t- At para raw kay Maria, ang Diyos ay isang Diyos na nagsasalita (\"One who speaks\"). \n\t- Sa halip na magkaroon ng **pilosopikal na konsepto** sa Diyos (gaya, halimbawa, na Siya ay \"First Cause\" o sanhi ng lahat; o kaya \"Supreme Being,\" na nangangahulugang ang pag-iral niya ay nakahihigit sa lahat ng iba pang pag-iral, atbp.), ang Diyos ay maituturing na **Unang Tagapagsalita** (\"First Speaker\"). \n- Gaya ng nakita natin sa dasal ni Samuel, sa dasal din ni Maria ang Diyos ay nakikilala sa kanyang Salita. At sa pamamagitan ng kanyang **Salita** ==Siya **tumatawag** sa tao== (sa kaso ni Samuel) o ==nagpapahayag ng kung ano ang Kanyang **niloloob**.==\n- Kung ang Diyos nga ay makikilala sa pamamagitan ng kanyang Salita, bumabalik tayo sa hamon *(challenge)* at suliranin *(problem)* kung **paano ba ito maririnig sa pagdarasal?**\n\t- Paano ba maririnig itong Diyos na tumatawag sa isang tao habang nananatili sa kanyang katahimikan din? \n\t- Paano nga ba maririnig ang tawag ng Diyos (kung mayroon man) na nagpapahayag ng kanyang kalooban kung saan sa pangkaraniwang buhay ng isang tao marahil inuuna niya ang kanyang mga hangarin *(current? desire)*, ninanais *(past? desire)*, nilalayon *(objective)*?\n- Mailalapat din ang suliranin na ito kahit sa hindi naniniwala sa Diyos. \n\t- Kung babalikan natin si Levinas (na muli, siyang sinusundan din ni Westphal), ang **tawag ng iba** **o ng aking kapuwa** ay ang **tawag** sa akin na managot para sa kanila. \n\t- Ang kapuwa ko kung gayon, una sa lahat ay **nagsasalita** rin sa pamamagitan ng kanyang tawag. Tinatawag ako ng iba na magkaroon ng pananagutan ('_responsibility_') sa kanila na mangyayari lamang kung nakikinig ako sa tawag nila na isantabi ko ang aking sarili upang tumugon sa kanila. \n\t- Ang isang tao na inuuna ang kapakanan *(kalagayan; welfare)* ng iba ay isang tao na w==ala na sa sentro ng kanyang buhay==; may pagbabagong nagaganap din sa kanya ayon kay Levinas, kung saan ang sarili niya ay hindi na isang **sarili-na-maka-sarili** ngunit isang ==**sarili-na-para-sa-iba**.==\n- Ngunit ang suliranin, muli, ay paano ba **maririnig ang tahimik na tawag ng aking kapwa kung ang isang tao ay inuuna ang sarili niyang mga pakay at mga pagnanais?**\n\n### \"Narito ako\"\n- Ang Diyos at ang Iba (_l'autre_), bagaman may walang-hanggang pagkakaiba, ay may pagkakatulad pa rin.\n\t- Reminder: alterity = \"the state of being other/different; otherness\"\n- Ayon kay [Jacques Derrida](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/derrida/), sa ganang ibang-iba sa akin (_alterity_) ang Diyos at ang aking kapuwa, sila ay parehong ==tumatawag sa akin na magkaroon ng mga hangarin na lagpas na sa aking sarili.== \n\t- Nangunguna ang tawag ng Diyos gaya rin na nangunguna ng tawag ng aking kapuwa. \n\t- Ang tanong na lamang ay kung naririnig at tutugon ang isang tao sa tawag na ito.\n- Anong uri ng tugon sa Diyos ang matatagpuan sa binigkas ni Maria? Gaya ni Samuel, ang tugon din ni Maria sa anghel ay ==\"Narito ako na lingkod ng Panginoon\"== (Lucas 1:38). \n\t- Bagaman nalito at marahil natakot din siya sa binalita sa kanya ni Gabriel, ==hinandog niya pa rin ang kanyang sarili.==\n- Ngunit hindi simpleng paghahandog ng sarili ang ginawa niya. Tandaan, binigkas niya ang mga salitang iyan **pagkatapos** sabihin sa kanya ang mga mangyayari sa buhay niya na napagpasiyahan na ng Diyos. \n\t- 'Di gaya ni Samuel na nagsabi ng \"Narito ako\" **bago** malaman ang niloloob ng Diyos, sinabi ni Maria ang kanyang \"Narito ako\" nang may katiyakan na ==magbabago ang buhay niya sa isang paraan na hindi niya man lang naisip.==\n\t- Bagaman marahil hindi niya lubusang naunawaan ang dahilan kung **bakit** siya ang pinili ng Diyos, at bagaman hindi niya naintindihan kung **paano** magaganap ang niloloob ng Diyos na isisilang niya ang Anak ng Diyos habang siya'y isang dalaga--hindi pa rin tumalikod si Maria. \n- Sa kanyang \"Narito ako,\" hinahandog niya ang kanyang sarili at pinakitang handa siyang tuparin ang niloloob ng Diyos. Iyan ang kanyang akto ng ==paghahandog ng sarili o \"self-presentation\"==:\n\n\u003e She understands that God is here, unusually so in the **present** instance, and the only question is whether I am willing and able to be here too. [. . .] She also understands that ==**to be present to God**, she must turn away from the world in which she has been immersed.== Not that there is something evil about the world, into which, in fact, God will send her back with a task. It is rather that apart from that turning, ==the world is defined by her agenda, however innocent, and not God‚Äôs== (p.22).\n\n- Nagsisimula ang lahat sa ==pagpapakita o presentasyon ng ating sarili. ==\n\t- Madali kasing talikuran ang tawag ng iba at magtago. Maaari kang magkunwari na hindi mo ito narinig. Maaari mo ring sabihin na akala mo iba ang tinatawag.\n- Halimbawa: sa mga pagkakataon na maraming nasalanta ng bagyo at may _call for donations_ na ginawa ang lokal na gobyerno, o ng Ateneo, o ng ibang institusyon, maaari mong isiping hindi para sa iyo ang tawag na iyon: _Marami namang **iba** na tutulong, kaya hindi kailangang ako_. _Marami namang mayroong higit na kakayahan at kapasidad na tumulong sa mga nasalanta, kaya hindi kailangang ako ang tumulong._ \n\t- At habang maaaring totoo nga ito, at habang marami nga tayong makatuwirang dahilan kung bakit may ilang pagkakataon na hindi tayo tumutugon sa tawag ng iba, ==ang hindi pa rin natin maitatanggi ay **narinig** natin ang tawag ng iba.==\n- Ang ibig kong sabihin ay ito: ==Totoong may tawag.== Lagi't laging may tumatawag. Tumugon man tayo ng **Oo** o **Hindi** sa tawag na ito, at kahit magbingi-bingihan tayo sa tawag na ito, nananatili pa ring totoo ang tawag. Ibang bagay na nga lamang kung handa tayong sabihing \"Narito ako.\"\n\n### \"Belonging\" at \"Disponibilite\"\n#### Pagiging-sa-Diyos\n- Buod:\n\t- Pansinin na tila may dagdag tayong makikitang aspeto ng **pananampalataya** sa pagturing ni Maria sa sarili niya (\"self-identification,\" p.22) bilang lingkod ng Diyos. \n\t- Para kay Maria, ang pagiging lingkod ng Diyos ay **pagiging-_sa-_Diyos** (_to belong to God_). \n\t- Gamit si Marcel, ayon kay Westphal ang tila ipinapahayag ni Maria sa Diyos ay \"_I belong to you_.\" \n\t- At ang pagiging-_sa-_Diyos na ito ay hindi kinakailangang isipin bilang pagmamay-ari lamang ng isang bagay (_possession_) na maaari mong itapon (\"disposable,\" p.23) kung hindi mo na kailangan.\n- Gaya ng maaaring unawain na hindi pang-aalipin ang pagiging lingkod ng isang tao sa isang panginoon na tinuturing niyang mabuti, ang **pagiging-sa-Diyos** ng isang tao ay nangangahulugan na ==**malayang** binibigay niya ang kanyang sarili sa Diyos. ==\n\t- Paradox: belonging to God is freeing\n- Ang sumusunod ay hiniram ni Westphal kay Marcel upang ilarawan ang malayang pagbibigay ng sariling kalayaan na ito:\n\n\u003e \"This does not mean . . . I am your slave; on the contrary, I freely put myself in your hands; the best use I can make of my freedom is to place it in your hands; it is as though I **freely substituted your freedom for my own**; or paradoxically, ==**it is by that very substitution that I realize my freedom**==\" (p.22-23)\n\n- Komentaryo:\n\t- freedom inherently has choice; self-determination\n\t- freedom provided by God: giving up our plans, desires? for the will of God\n\t- look at it as a gift (regalo)..gift of freedom\n- Ang \"substitution\" na nilalarawan ni Marcel dito ay **paghalili** *(replacement)* ng kalayaan ng iba sa iyong sariling kalayaan. Sa ganitong paraan, ==ang kalayaan ko ay waring 'napapalitan' ng kalayaan ng iba.==\n- Ang interesante rito ay kung paanong sa pagbibigay daw ng sariling kalayaan ko ay **doon ko rin lubusang naisasakatuparan ang sarili kong kalayaan.** *(By giving up my freedom, I also fully materialize my freedom)*\n\t- Kumbaga, hindi 'nawawala' o 'nasasayang' ang kalayaang ito; bagkus, lalo pa itong nagiging **tunay na** **akin** at **tunay na malaya** kapag ito'y isang kalayaan na nilalayon tuparin ang hinahangad ng iba.\n\t- Sa ganitong alternatibong pag-unawa sa kahulugan ng kalayaan ng tao--sa halip na isipin ito bilang pamamaraan upang matupad ko ang gusto't ninanais ko--maaaring magbago rin ang pag-unawa natin sa kahulugan ng ating pag-iral.\n- _Para saan o kanino nga ba nililikha at hinuhubog ng isang tao ang kanyang buhay gamit ang kanyang kalayaan? Para sa sarili lamang ba? O para sa iba?_\n\n#### Disponibilit√©\n- **Disponibilit√© *(disposability)*:** Ang maging ==para-sa-iba==, para sa Diyos man o sa kapuwa, ay ang pagiging handang tumugon sa kanilang tawag at tuparin ang kanilang niloloob. \n\t- Ang _dispsonibilit√©_ ay ang pagiging nariyan para sa pangangailangan ng iba.\n- Ang taong handang tumugon sa tawag ng iba ay isang taong ==handang iwan ang kanyang sarili.== Hindi man ito magawa sa lahat ng pagkakataon, ang taong handang tumugon sa tawag ng iba ay kayang isantabi ang kanyang pag-iisip at pagkilos para sa sarili lamang.\n- Kainino natin maaaring nasabi ang mga salitang \"Ako ay sa iyo\"? Kanino tayo maaaring maging handa isantabi ang sarili nating mga layunin upang isakatuparan ang layunin nila?\n\t- Baka nasabi mo na ang \"Ako ay sa iyo\"¬† sa isang iniibig mo. Kapag may ininiibig kang tao, hindi mo pinagkakait ang oras at lakas mo upang tugunan ang kanyang pangangailangan. Uunahin mo pa nga siya kaysa sa iyong sarili. Sa pagsabing _Mahal kita_ tila sinasabi mo rin na ikaw ay sa kanya. Tila may sinusuko kang bahagi ng iyong sarili, kundi man ang buong sarili mo mismo. Dahil ano namang uri ng pag-ibig iyon kung wala akong handang ibigay sa siyang iniibig ko? Anong klase ng pag-ibig iyon kung mauuna pa rin lagi ang aking sarili? Pag-ibig pa ba iyon kung walang magbabago sa akin?\n\n#### Kunin Mo\n- May isang dasal si San Ignacio na tinatawag na _Suscipe_. Nangangahulugan ang _suscipe_ ng \"pagkuha,\" o \"kunin.\" Tingnan natin ito ng sandali, bagaman malamang narinig mo na ito:\n\n**_Suscipe_¬† / \"Paghahandog ng Sarili\"**\n\u003e Take Lord, and receive all my liberty, \n\u003e my memory, my understanding, \n\u003e and my entire will, all that I have and possess. \n\u003e Thou hast given all to me. To Thee, O lord, I return it.\n\u003e All is Thine, dispose of it wholly according to Thy will. \n\u003e Give me Thy love and thy grace, for this is sufficient for me.\n\n\u003e Kunin Mo, O Diyos, at tanggapin Mo  \n\u003e Ang aking kalayaan, ang aking kalooban  \n\u003e Isip at gunita ko, lahat ng hawak ko,  \n\u003e Ng loob ko ay aking alay sa 'Yo\n\u003e \n\u003e Nagmula sa 'Yo ang lahat ng ito  \n\u003e Muli kong handog sa 'Yo  \n\u003e Patnubayan Mo't paghariang lahat  \n\u003e Ayon sa kalooban Mo  \n\u003e Mag utos Ka, Panginoon ko\n\u003e \n\u003e Dagling tatalima ako  \n\u003e Ipagkaloob Mo lang ang pag-ibig Mo  \n\u003e At lahat ay tatalikdan ko  \n\u003e Tatalikdan ko\n\n- Pansinin lamang na tila isang **kabalintuaan** *(paradox)* ang pinapahiwatig ng dasal ni San Ignacio. Sa halip na naisin niya na may matanggap siya **mula sa Diyos**, ang hiling ni Ignacio ay ang kunin at tanggapin ng Diyos ang lahat **mula sa kanya**. Nais ni Ignacio na gamitin siya ng Diyos ayon sa Kanyang mga ninanais; na maging instrumento siya upang tuparin ang niloloob ng Diyos.\n- Dagdag pa, makatuwiran lamang para kay Ignacio na ialay ang kanyang buong sarili sa Diyos dahil ==ang lahat naman na taglay niya--ang kanyang kalayaan, kalooban, isip at gunita, atbp.)--ay galing naman sa Diyos.==\n\t- Kung gayon, ang 'paghahandog' ni Ignacio ng kanyang sarili sa Diyos ay ==isang pababalik lamang ng kanyang natanggap--isang 'muling' pagbibigay.==\n- \"All is Thine, **dispose** of it wholly according to Thy will.\" \n\t- Makikita mo sa linyang ito ang mga bakas ng pagiging-sa-Diyos at _disponibilit√©_. \n\t- Kung mayroon mang dalisay na pananampalataya, marahil hindi ito nalalayo sa ipinapahiwatig ng dasal ni Ignacio.\n\n\n### \"Gelassenheit\"\n- Ang _Gelassenheit_ ay salitang Aleman na madalas isalin sa Ingles na ==\"to let be\" o \"letting-be.\"== Maaaring isalin ito sa wika natin bilang ==**pagpapaubaya** o **pagpaparaya**.==\n- Pansinin na sa katunayan, **napagpasyahan** **na** ng Diyos ang lahat ng mga mangyayari kay Maria.\n\t- Madaling isipin na ang pagsabi niya ng \"Mangyari sa akin\"/\"_Let it be_\" ay tila isang pagsuko sa isang hatol *(judgement)* na binaba na; isang pagsuko sa isang bagay kasi 'wala naman na akong magawa' (\"resignation,\" p.25).\n\t- Sa ganitong paraan maaaring isipin na tila ==balintiyak (_passive_)== ang _Gelassenheit_ at _fiat_ ni Maria: nagmumukha itong isang pagpapabaya na tila kung saan ==wala na akong gagawin dahil hindi naman ako kasama sa nangyari.==\n\t- Pero pansinin na ang **hayaang mangyari** ang isang bagay na siyang kaluhugan ng _Gelassenheit_ ay minsan ==mas mahirap pang gawin== kaysa sa anumang aktibong gawain_._\n- Halimbawa: Kapag hinahayaan ko ang aking anak na matutong magbisikleta sa sarili niya, hindi ko ito ginagawa dahil sa wala akong pakialam sa kanya. Kung ako lamang, ayaw kong bitawan ang bisekleta o tanggalin ang _training wheels_ dahil natatakot akong mahulog at masaktan siya. \n\t- Pero ano ang mangyayari kung hindi ko bibitawan ang bisekleta? Ano ang mangyayari kung hindi ko siya hahayaang matuto na ibalense ang sarili niya? Hindi siya matututo. Hindi siya makakabisikleta. Sa ganitong pagkakataon, ==ang **hayaan** ang anak ko matutunan ibalanse ang sarili niya ang paraan ng pagmamahal ko sa kanya.== Sa pagbitaw ko sa kanya, doon ko siya lalong minamahal.\n- Sa pagsabi ni Maria na \"mangyari sa akin ang ayon sa iyong salita,\" tila ito ang pinapahayag niya: '_Iyang sinasabi mo, bagaman kamangha-mangha at bagaman hindi ko lubos na naunawaan kung paano mangyayari, **hindi ko iyan babaguhin. Hahayaan kong mangyari iyan**.'_\n- Iyan ang halaga ng salitang \"**ayon**\" sa \"mangyari sa akin ang **ayon** sa iyong salita\" (o \"**according** to your word\").\n\t- Mahilig kasi tayong makialam sa mga pangyayari lalo na sa kung anong paraan ito mangyayari. Iyan ang hindi maiwasan ng isang tao na nasa sentro pa ng lahat.\n\t\t- Nais niya hawakan (_pris_) ang lahat; hindi siya nagtitiwala sa iba. Kaya tinatakda niya kung _ano_, _kailan_, at _paano_ magaganap ang isang pangyayari. \n\t\t- Kaya naman para sa taong ganito, wala talagang sorpresa (_sur-prise_) para sa kanya. Dahil ==wala siyang hinahayaang dumating mula sa labas ng abot-tanaw ng kanyang nalalaman at nahahawakan.==\n\t- Sa halip nito, ang tao na isinantabi ang kanyang sarili ay ==hinahayaang matupad ang isang pangyayari== **sa sarili** **nitong panahon**, mula sa **sarili nitong mga dahilan**, at sa pamamagitan ng **sarili nitong mga paraan**.\n\t\t- **Pinapahintulutan** *(give permission)* niyang pumasok sa kanyang buhay ang siyang nagmumula sa labas ng abot-tanaw ng kanyang iniisip, nahahawakan, inaasahan. \n\t\t- Para sa kanya,¬† may sorpresa--kundi man Diyos o anghel, maaaring isang kapuwa-tao na inaanyayahan siyang tumugon sa isang di-inasahang tawag.\n- **\"I must somehow make room for the other in myself\"** (p.22). Ang gumawa ng ganitong ==espasyo sa mismong sarili== upang tanggapin ang siyang dumarating na lamang bilang ==isang sorpresa==, iyan ang kahulugan ng _decentered self_.\n\n### \"Fiat voluntas tua\"\n\u003e **\"Prayer does not change God; it changes the one who offers it.\"**\n\u003e **S√∏ren Kierkegaard**\n\n- **Buod:**\n\t- Ang _fiat_ ni Maria ay ang ==pagpapahintulot niyang mangyari sa kanyang sariling buhay ang siyang naaayon sa salita ng Diyos.==\n\t- Ang hayaan mong baguhin ang iyong buhay ng isang \"Tao\" o \"Bagay\" (Ang Sumasaibayo), habang tunay na nakakatakot, marahil ito rin ==ang pinakamataas na pagsasakatuparan ng iyong kalayaan.==\n- Sa kanyang \"Mangyari sa akin ang ayon sa iyong salita,\" pansinin na may 'hinihiling' din si Maria mula sa Diyos. Tila may 'prayer request' din na mababakas sa kanyang _fiat._\n\t- Ngunit naunawaan mo na marahil na ibang-iba (dahil para-sa-iba) ang hiling ni Maria kaysa sa marahil pangkaraniwang ipinagdarasal ng tao. \n\t- Ang tanging hiling ni Maria ay ==_mangyari nga_ _sa kanya_ ang niloloob ng Diyos. ==\n\t- **_At sa aktong ito ng pagsuko ng sarili sa niloloob ng Diyos maaaring matagpuan natin ang ==dalisay na pananampalataya_**.==\n- **_Fiat voluntas tua_.** *(May thy will be done)*\n\t- Iyan din ang ibig sabihin ng \"Amen\" na binibigkas ng isang tao na nagdadasal sa katapusan ng \"Ama Namin\" (p.25) o ng ibang dasal. \n\t- Kapag tinutuldukan niya ang kanyang dasal ng salitang \"Amen\" pagkatapos sabihin ang lahat ng tila hinihiling niya sa Diyos para sa kanyang sarili, tila ang sinasabi pa rin niya ay _Sa lahat ng ito_==, _m__angyari pa rin nawa ang Kanyang niloloob--hindi ang kalooban ko._== Amen. _So be it_. Siya nawa.\n- Ayon kay Westphal, pagkatapos lamang ng pagkakaroon ng ganitong uri ng 'tindig' o _posture_ tungo sa nangungunang kalooban ng Diyos maaaring magdasal ang isang tao _para sa kanyang sarili_ at kanyang mga _minamahal_:\n\n\u003e We hear the decentering force of the prayer in its actual wording: **_your_** **name**, **_your_** **kingdom**, **_your_** **will** (Matt. 6:9‚Äì10). Here is a triple threat against all aspiration to autonomy, a triple abandonment of my preoccupation with myself. After, but **only after I have made this move**, **I am in a position to pray rightly for material and spiritual blessings, daily bread, and forgiveness, for myself and for ‚Äò‚Äòus.‚Äô‚Äô** And no sooner have I done so than the doxology, which is sometimes included in the prayer and sometimes serves as its liturgical trailer, reminds me of what I can so quickly forget: ‚Äò‚Äòfor the kingdom, the power, and the glory are yours, now and forever.‚Äô‚Äô **The Amen** (so be it) that concludes this prayer, echoes the **‚Äò‚Äòlet it be‚Äô‚Äô** of Mary‚Äôs prayer, just as the ‚Äò‚Äò_your_ name,‚Äô‚Äô ‚Äò‚Äò_your_ kingdom,‚Äô‚Äô and ‚Äò‚Äò_your_ will‚Äô‚Äô echo her ‚Äò‚Äò_your_ word.‚Äô‚Äô ==To feel the full force of the self-transformation called for by this self-transcendence is to understand how learning to pray is the **task of a lifetime**==\" (p.25).\n\n- _Paano ba magdasal? Ano ba ang ganap na dasal?_ Palagay ko hindi nakararating ang isang taong nagdarasal sa isang ganap o perpektong dasal hanggang siya'y nagpapatuloy mabuhay. \n\t- Kung ang dasal ay siya ngang pagsasantabi ng sarili upang gumawa ng espasyo para sa iba, kung gayon ang buhay ng tao ang kanyang mismong dasal. \n\t- Sa pang-araw-araw na buhay ==nagaganap itong pagsubok baguhin ang ating sarili upang tumugon sa tawag ng Diyos. ==\n\t- Marahil pa nga, ==ang pagtugon sa tawag ng kapuwa ay ang pagtugon din sa tawag ng Diyos.==\n- Kung ang pagdarasal nga ay ang akto ng tahimik na **pakikinig** at **pagiging handa** **na tumugon** sa **tawag ng isang Iba**, ==ang buhay nga ay maaari rin maging isang walang katapusang pagsubok matutong magdasal.==\n\n### Absolutong Pananagutan sa Diyos\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJhQxZPdv-Y\n\n**Mga paksa na tinalakay sa lektura:**\n-   Mga yugto ng kuwento ng Pagsubok ng Diyos kay Abraham (Genesis 22: 1-14)\n-   Absolutong pananagutan *(responsibility)*\n    -   Pananagutan sa Iba\n    -   Pananagutan sa Diyos\n-   Absolutong pananampalataya *(faith)*\n    -   _double movement_ o \"dalawang kilos ng pananampalataya\" ayon kay Kierkegaard\n        1.  _infinite resignation_ o \"walang hanggang pagsuko\"\n        2.  _leap of_ _faith_ o \"lundag ng pananamplataya\"\n\n\n- **Ang dalisay na pananampalataya ay humahantong sa absolutong pananagutan sa Diyos**.\n- Sources:\n\t- [pagsubok ng Diyos kay Abraham (Genesis 22: 1-14)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+22\u0026version=MBBTAG)\n\t- ang mga kaisipan ng pilosopo na si S√∏ren Kierkegaard sa kanyang [_Fear and Trembling_](https://books.google.com.ph/books/about/Fear_and_Trembling.html?id=xODQDwAAQBAJ\u0026printsec=frontcover\u0026source=kp_read_button\u0026hl=en\u0026redir_esc=y#v=onepage\u0026q\u0026f=false).\n- Pambungad\n\t- \"To become involved with God in any other way than being wounded is impossible\": Soren Kierkegaard\n- Ang kuwento nina Abraham at Isaac\n\t- Walang dasal; purong aktong pakikining, at purong aktong paglalakbay (he just listened and did it)\n\t- Tanong ni Isaac: \"Mayroon na tayong apoy at panggatong, ngunit nasaan ang tupang ihahandog?\" Sumagot si Abraham, \"Anak, ang Diyos ang magbibigay niyon.\"\n\t\t- Nilihim niya ang plano niya *(secret)*\n\t- ginagawang singular? mag-isa? ng pananagutan (responsibility) niya\n\t- iwanan niya ang lahat\n- Absolutong Pananagutan\n\t- \"only one thing is necessary\"; \"iisa lang ang kinakailangan\": sinabi ni Kristo kay Maria\n- Absolutong Pananampalataya\n\t- Maybe Abraham wasn't lying when he said God would give it\n\t- *Double movement* ang ginawa ni Abraham\n\t\t- ==\"infinite resignation\":== walang hanggang pagsuko *(surrender to God forever)*\n\t\t\t- iniwan ng lahat, sinasabi na \"sa diyos nalang ako\"; lahat ng mahalaga sa akin ay wala na\n\t\t- ==\"leap of faith\": ==lundag ng pananampalataya\n\t\t\t- nandoon pa rin ng pananampalataya na hindi mawala si Isaac\n\t\t\t- \"By virtue of the absurd...\" hindi lang alam kung paano, may ipinagkaloob ng Diyos\n\t\t\t- Hal. trust fall\n\t\t\t\t- Para maging successful ng trust fall mo, kailangan mo malundag...\n\t\t\t\t- Kailangan ka maging handa na masaktan ka\n\t\t\t\t- Pero maniwala ka na hindi ka nasasaktan (kasi alam mo nasasaluin ka)\n- \"Sa bundok ni Yahweh may nakalaan\"\n\t- Nakalaan: reserve, destined\n\t- sa pagbibgay ko sa kanya, hindi siya mawala sa akin....\n\t- Alam mo lang ng pagsubok ay pagiging pagsubok kung tapos na siya\n\n### Mapagmuni-muning Papel\n**Tanong: Dalisay ba ang pananampalataya ni Yossel Rakover sa Diyos?**\n#### Notes\n##### Story\n\u003e I never saw my two children again, and in a dream I was told not to worry about them, because theyw ere in the hands of *Rebyoyne-shel-Oylem* (\"Almighty God\")\n\n\u003e Like Job...I return to the earth naked\n\n\u003e I served God enthusiastically, and my one request of Him was that He should allow me to serve Him *bikol livovekho, bikhol nafshekho ubikhol miodekho* (\"With all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might\"; Deuteronomy 6:5, Hebrew)\n\n\u003e ...I can say with absolutely certainity that my faith in Him has not changed a hair's breadth\n\n\u003e Formerly, well-off: relationship with God was one who kept on granting favors\n\u003e Now: one who owes me something, owes me much; he believes he has the right to demand it of Him\n\n\u003e Won't ask why he deserves this (related to Mary?); instead, believes that it's a time of *histress-ponim* (\"Veiling of God's countenance\") (support?)\n\u003e God has veiled His countenance from the world, and has thus delivered people over to their savage impulses.

Need to be okay with uncertainty in my life...all in God's plan\n\n##### Draft\nSoren Kierkegaard once said that \"to become involved with God in any other way than being wounded is impossible\". We seek a relationship with God so that we can become better people. However, change requires sacrifice, which is inherently painful. Therefore, after reading the appeal of Yassel Rakover's, a Holocaust victim, I believe that his faith in God is true. This can be seen in his relationship with God and how he applies it to his life. \n\nRakover's faith is true because it's unconditional. Conditional faith is fragile because it's based on expectations for God ‚Äî setting people up for disappointment. For instance, many people see God as one that grants favors. When they go through a negative or positive experience that disrupts this image (e.g. the silence of God; the existence of evil), their faith in God is diminished. Despite being a victim of the Holocaust, Rakover's faith in God remains. \n\nWhat drives his faith? He's aware that he lacks an understanding of God. According to San Agustin, a God that can be understood is not God; anything that can be understood about him does not belong to him. Since he is \"semper major\" (ever greater), he'll always slip past our limited understanding. So when we try to define him, we end up putting him in a prison of our expectations ‚Äî preventing God from being different from these.\n\nThis is why Rakover doesn't want to assume that God and his judgment are just: it disrespects God. Assuming that the Jews deserve bad would desecrate God because it reduces him to a simplistic concept. Believing in a God we can never understand is a challenge we struggle with our entire lives. Rakover does this until the time of his death. That's unconditional faith: one that is unwavering. \n\nThe authenticity of Rakover's faith can also be seen in how he practices it in life: finding meaning in his suffering through God. He writes: \"I am proud that I am a Jew not in spite of the world's treatment of us, but precisely because of this treatment\". He believed that the pain he went through brought honor to God's laws. His perspective can be seen as a religious experience, according to St. Tomas. He chose (eligare) to tie (ligare) himself to God ‚Äî an entity bigger than him ‚Äî making him read (legere) his life through a different lens. \n\nHe ties himself to God through prayer, which Merold Westphal calls the \"deepest decentering of the self\". This happens through the process of *kenosis*, where he sets aside his own desires (e.g. miracles, mercy, vengeance). He gives himself up so that he can belong to God. He voluntarily became God's servant, ready to fully respond and fulfill his needs with all of his heart, soul, and might (*bikhol livovekho, bikhol nafshekho ubikhol miodekho*). This is *disponibilit√©*, and it can also be seen in the last line of his appeal: \"Biyodekho Adoshem afkid rukhi!\", which means \"Into Your Hands, O lord, I commit my spirit!\" Can you call your faith true if you always put yourself first, not ready to give yourself to the one you believe in?\n\nHowever, Rakover describes his relationship with God as \"...no longer the relationship of a slave to his master but rather that of a pupil to his rebbe\". Belonging to God shouldn't be seen as owning something that you can dispose of when you don't need it. Instead, it is freely giving yourself to God. And by giving your own freedom, you also fully materialize it. Using his own freedom, Rakover creates and shapes his life not for himself, but for his God. As a rebbe, God teaches Rakover the singular way to live his life: the Torah. This opens his perspective, showing him how to find meaning in everything that he does ‚Äî even dying. \n\nThe result of true faith is an absolute responsibility to God. Rakover fulfills this through *gelassenheit*: letting be of his life. After a long duration of trying to survive and fight (active doing), he accepts his death. In this act, we can see what Kierkegaard calls the double movements of faith. First, infinite resignation. Rakover leaves behind everything important to him, including his life, except his faith in God ‚Äî who he still believes in until his death. Second, the leap of faith. Even if he is giving up his life, he still believes that he will be saved by God. This can be seen in his belief in an afterlife. Just like Abraham believed that there is something destined for us in God's mountain, Rakover believes that he will have a space in heaven, together with his family and millions of dead Jews. Perhaps this is why Jews die peacefully. Because of their faith, death is seen as not worrying but freeing. Despite not knowing what'll happen to them, they are certain that they'll be taken care of by God. \n\nOne thing that I can learn from them is the ability to let go of control in my life. My desire to secure my future has led me to make extensive career plans and work endless hours. The results of this were constant anxiety and perpetual burnout. Personally, I'm still trying to fight my workaholism; what has really helped me was reconnecting with my faith. It has taught me that there are much more important things in life than success and that God has a plan for all of us. It is him, not me, who knows what's best for my life. This belief allows me to be open to whatever happens to me, even if it's disappointing. Just like with Rakover, I believe that suffering is how God shows his love, for it's what helps me become a better person.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T15:56:56.99213622Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2022-03-14":{"title":"2022-03-14","content":"## ENE\n### An Overview of Discourse\n**Questions:**\n- What enables us to think about and in the process, tell these stories?\n- Why and how can we tell stories in a way that is compelling and engaging at the same time?\n\n**Notes:**\n- Ratsinsky (2011) argued that the idea of discourse has become increasingly popular; has been used many times without being explicitly defined\n- Discourse in narrative studies is the way a story is told or presented to its audience\n- Includes:\n\t- how much time is dedicated to a particular scene\n\t- The amount of dialogue that is allotted to a particular character\n\t- The choice of actors to play characters\n- Basically: The expression/telling of a story\n- Questions:\n\t- Is it possible to have an exciting plot, but a lousy discourse? \n\t- Or possble to have a lousy plot or engaging narrative discourse?\n\n**TL;DR:**\n- It's the ==way a story is told or presented== to the audience. \n-  If narrative structure is the WHAT, narrative discourse is the ==HOW.==\n\n### Order, Duration, \u0026 Frequency\n**Notes:**\n- Order\n\t- the organization of the presents, and how it's presented to us\n\t- significant bc of how the events may be pieced together by the audience\n\t- important to the overall story and/or theme/topic!\n- Duration\n\t- often tied with frequency\n\t\t- both elements place emphasis on events\n\t\t- they tell us about a particular point/episode in a character's life?\n\t- E.G.

Not beginner-friendly at all! Requires a lot of technical literacy....\n\n\n**Writing:**\n\nA topic I'd love to change the discourse of in STEM is Web3. This refers to the newest iteration of the World Wide Web; based on blockchain technology, it includes innovations like cryptocurrencies and NFTs. Like many of my friends, I used to be a skeptic; based on what I saw I assumed that these technologies were wasteful and that only the rich and privileged could benefit from them. However, after exploring this space on my own (by [joining fellowships](https://kernel.community) and contributing to communities), I realized Web3's potential in building a better future ‚Äî one that is solarpunk.\n\nSolarpunk originally started as a niche environmental movement centered around renewable energy and sustainable technology; it's now evolved to be all about building an optimistic future together. Some questions to think of: How can we integrate, rather than separate, technology and our environment? How can we thrive alongside each other and the world around us, instead of being in opposition to it? How can we advocate for convivial conservation, self-sustainability, and social inclusiveness, and make sure that these are accessible to everyone? In a nutshell: if typical sci-fi genres like cyberpunk are focused on what we should move away from (e.g. dystopian mega-corps, corrupt governments, fading rebel alliances), then solarpunk is focused on what we should move towards in the future.\n\nIn a solarpunk future, I believe that public goods are abundant. These can come in so many forms;  they exist not only in the physical sphere (e.g. parks, libraries, public transportation) but also in the [digital sphere](https://issuu.com/biancamikaila/docs/aguilar_finalproject) (e.g. knowledge, software, privacy). Despite how vital public goods are to our lives (can you imagine a world without museums or Wikipedia?), they're often difficult to develop due to a lack of support from the public. This problem is known as the [tragedy of the commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons): people usually act selfishly and cause depletion of a public resource, instead of working together to sustain it. A promising solution to this are regenerative economic tools being built in the Web3 space; these can serve as a coordination mechanism that ensures that everyone contributes. One example of this is [Gitcoin Grants](https://gitcoin.co/grants/), which can be described as Web3 version of Kickstarter. Public goods projects are supported through [Quadratic Funding](https://www.radicalxchange.org/concepts/quadratic-funding/): a mathematically optimal model that prioritizes projects based on how many people contributed; this encourages people to make contributions (no matter how small they are) since it's ensured that funds will be democratically allocated in a way that benefits the public.\n\nUnfortunately, not many people of because of the pessimistic narratives that saturate the space (e.g. hyperfinancialization, environmental destruction). Even if these are based on truth, we need to resist doomerism; if we aren't intentional in choosing the narratives we want to see in the world, we could end up trapped in them. While it's important to be critical of new tech, we should also utilize the agency we have to take back control. This is what a solarpunk narrative does; it gives us hope because it reminds us that we all play a role in building the future we want to see. This optimistic mindset is what motivates me to stay involved in the space. As a designer and educator, I want to change Web3's dominant narrative by helping bring these regenerative tools to life ‚Äî whether it's through building them or advocating for them. The more people get to benefit from these tools, the more positive the narrative will become. \n\n**Sources:**\n\n### Discourse in a nutshell\n- Discourse is the HOW of our narratives\n- Defined and described in various ways...\n\t- **Narrative studies**\n\t\t- the way events are told\n\t\t- the presentation/expression of the events\n\t\t- *the way the events are told is meant to cause certain effects on us as readers \u0026 viewers*\n\t- **Post-structuralism**\n\t\t- very related to ideology\n\t\t- uncovering ways we end up talking about things over a period of time\n\t\t- *So much of what was taught to us to accept are in fact, not common sense knowledge*\n\t- **Discourse \u0026 language**\n\t\t- a way to talk about things that have persisted for a long time\n\t\t- studying how content can be presented to people \u0026 community\n\t\t- *analysis of discourse can help influence people and align them to our cause*\n- Why we study discourse\n\t- What's the agenda here?\n\t- Is there an agenda that I'm not aware of?\n\t- What am I missing here?\n\t- What is the narrative telling me?\n\t- What is it NOT telling me?\n- Changing discourse = changing society\n\n### Application Task 1\n\u003e In an essay using 1,500 words or less, discuss your answer to the question: _HOW DID SAVE RALPH, THROUGH ITS DISCOURSE, HELP YOU UNDERSTAND A KEY MESSAGE THAT YOU FOUND IN THE NARRATIVE?_ Below are some guide questions to help you get started: \n\n-   What key message/agenda did you see from the short film? \n-   What \"universal knowledge\" did the film try to go against? \n-   How did the elements of order, duration, and frequency, and other elements of the narrative help deliver that message/agenda?\n\n#### Draft\n**Notes:**\n- Key message agenda: stop animal testing for human cosmetics\n- Universal knowledge: animal testing for cosmetics is okay\n- How did elements of the narrative help deliver that message/agenda?\n\t- Order\n\t\t- We first spent time getting to know Ralph more...this humanized him, which helped us empathize with him more (e.g. morning routine, human setting, talking about family and dreams)\n\t\t- that way, when we got to the climax and conclusion (him being tested, being near death), it hit harder\n\t\t- presented as a documentary from his POV\n\t- Duration\n\t\t- majority of film dwelt on getting to know him (2 minutes)\n\t\t- abruptly went to testing part...was shorter bc we already have an idea of what testing is like\n\t\t- testing was cut off -\u003e went straight to aftermath\n\t\t\t- we don't need to see all of the testing to see how much it hurt :(\n\t- Frequency\n\t\t- testing is brought up a lot of times (e.g. his identity, everyone around him is a tester)\n\t\t- his pain is shown frequently as well :( (e.g. itching)\n\n**Ideas:**\n- maybe compare with PETA ads? they're gimmicky, which allows them to catch attention; however, they can turn a lot of people off\n\n**Outline:**\n1.

Conclusion; how it affected me\n\n#### Writing\n\nLet's be honest: humans are a pretty selfish race. This can be seen in the state of the animals around us; if they're not endangered or extinct, they're probably being used for producing our needs. How can we convince others to treat animals right? By humanizing them. The film \"Save Ralph\" accomplished this; through its discourse, it advocated for banning animal testing for human cosmetics. It did this by taking the form of a documentary centered around Ralph, a rabbit who works as a test subject. By showing us his point of view, the film made us empathize with animals, the subject of the issue. I'll be explaining how the film delivered its anti-testing agenda by analyzing the elements of its narrative.\n\nFirst, order: the way the narrator chose to organize and present events of the story to the audience. To bring out the audience's empathy, the film decides to portray Ralph like a human before showing how inhumane animal testing is. This is why it begins by Ralph literally introducing himself to us. We then get to see him do mundane things in his suburban home, like brushing his teeth and eating breakfast. From his actions to the setting, everything in this scene is very human. You can't see rabbits in real life live that way, right? But all of these narrative choices help us relate with him, since we do have routines and homes like Ralph's.\n\nEven from the start, the film is already conveying through Ralph its agenda: testing is harmful for animals. Thus, the first things we learn about Ralph are his injuries (i.e. blind right eye, tinnitus in right ear, chemical burns on his back). We find out that these came from his job as a test subject. He tells us that all of his family were subjects as well, saying: ‚ÄúThey all died doing their job, just like I will!\". Through illustrating his pain and loss, the film demonstrates how this human practice has made his life miserable, even before showing the testing itself. So by the time he is brought to the laboratory, we've become fully acquainted with him; this makes the succeeding scenes difficult to watch. \n\nNext, duration: the amount of time that was spent on scenes. Majority of the film was spent on getting to know Ralph; this ensured enough time for the audience to develop an attachment to him. The actual testing took the least amount of time; it even cut off while Ralph's eye was getting destroyed. The short and snappy style of this scene helped maximize its impact. If it was prolonged, I believe that the film would be less effective. It would've become similar to poverty porn, which exploits its subjects for the sake of triggering emotion. For example: whenever a natural disaster happens, I hate it whenever the news promotes \"Filipino resilience\" because it objectifies the victims. As someone who is highly sensitive, being exposed to an onslaught of these visuals (e.g. kids playing in the flood) is exhausting; it makes me want to disconnect from the world. If you want people to act, don't convince them in a way that turns them off.\n\nThankfully, \"Save Ralph\" doesn't do this. More time is spent on the aftermath of the testing, which helped further emphasize Ralph's humanity. Here, Ralph directly talks to the camera, thanking people who support animal testing for giving him a job (which is also a human construct). However, his grateful speech was in stark contrast with his aching appearance.  Even if we didn't see all of his testing, we can already tell that it's hurt him greatly. He didn't die, but it's implied that his death is near too. The film explicitly leaves out these scenes, making the audience fill in the gaps themselves. When we realize the gravity of his situation on our own, it hits much harder. \n\nFinally, frequency: the number of times a specific event recurred throughout the narrative. Alongside duration, this element is used by the the film in its \"Show, Don't Tell\" approach; it conveys its agenda through the context clues it provides for the audience. One instance of this is Ralph's symptoms, which he obviously struggles with for the entire film, from scratching his itchy back to needing help with his blindness. Another instance is the death of Ralph's loved ones, which is shown explicitly and implcitly. Before he admits that his family died from testing, we can see signs of life in his home (e.g. mug with multiple toothbrushes, family photos on the walls). His colleagues shout that they don't want to die; during the last scene, multiple crossed out names are written on the lockers. By constantly referencing affliciton and death, the film drives home the point that testing kills animals.\n\nBy humanizing animals in its discourse, \"Save Ralph\" was able to effectively campaign for banning cosmetic animal testing. It was able to motivate millions to sign their petition, propel Mexico to ban testing, and help advance legislation in many countries that make up the world‚Äôs most influential beauty markets (Humane Society International). I can't help but compare this campaign to PETA's advertising, which is infamous for making use of sexism and pornography (Pennington). Gimmicks may guarantee you attention, but will it help you accomplish your objective? What if your tactics end up alienating your target audience? This is why I believe in the value of liberal arts subjects like narrative studies. If changing discourse changes society, then it's important to know how to do it right. \n\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T15:56:56.99213622Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2022-03-16":{"title":"2022-03-16","content":"## ENE Application Task\n**Movie:** Birdshot\n- **What is the narrative all about?**\n\t- You may choose to discuss the plot using the structures that we discussed in Module 1\n\t- OR any structure that you deem appropriate in your discussion of the film's events\n- **How did the narrative tell the story?**\n\t- What \"universal knowledge\" about a key science issue did the film try to unpack and shift the conversation off?\n\t- How did it try to do this? \n\t- What \"new ways\" of looking at the issue did the film try to bring forward?\n\n**Notes:**\n- begins with teaching daughter how to shoot, because he wants her to learn how to take care of himself\n- goes to Domingo, the policeman POV? humanizing him? showing him w his family\n- issue: environmentalism? killing animals, illegal logging....\n- police are corrupt? boss is paying them. the older policeman resorts to violence during questioning. omg it got cut off right when they were gonna cut off his arm\n- how is the missing bus case related? \"everything starts from nothing\"\n- shit she went beyond the border....shit she shoots the eagle....the murder was cut off too...\n- oh shit shes wounded and running away\n- another issue: Hacienda; disupute for land....workers vs landlords\n- bus case may be political.....\n- \"it's not our fault\"\n- people trying to take the bus...\n- he had a dream?\n- they question Diego\n- Domingo tortues Diego himself....changes from naive to morally questionable\n- WTF THEY SHOT THE DOG....they also cut this\n- prison scene...shit they kill the guard...they break out\n- very snappy shots\n- very show dont tell approach\n- oh fuck theyre chasing diego\n- they attempt to run away, maya says she can fight for herself na\n- the shooting is cut away too\n- diego died too :((\n- great parallel: hunting birds at the beginning vs hunting man at the end\n- oh fuck domingo is escaping\n- OH FUCK THE DEAD PASSENGERS WERE IN THE HABITATION....\n\u003e \n\u003e For his second full-length feature film, young filmmaker Mikhail Red interweaves two plotlines that deal about loss of innocence of two characters as they cope with the harsh realities of survival.

Something must have started the motion in the first place.\n\t\t\t- otherwise, we'd end up in infinite regress: in a chain of reasoning, the evidence for each point along the chain relies on the existence of something that came before it...which in turn relies on something even further back...and so on...with no starting point\n\t\t\t- ^ this is logically impossible for Aquinas\n\t\t\t- E.G. line of dominoes\n\t\t- There can't be an infinite regress of movers...so there must be a first mover, itself unmoved, and that is God\n\t- Argument from Causation\n\t\t- like the argument from motion, but cause and effect\n\t\t- First causer, itself uncaused, and that is God\n\t- Argument from Contingency\n\t\t- necessary being vs contingent being\n\t\t\t- contingent = any being that COULD not have existed (e.g. you; the world would go on; your existence was contingent on other things)\n\t\t\t- What could prevent an infinite regress of contingency?

This idea is based on my Christian beliefs. One, God created the entire universe, which can be seen in the story of Genesis. Two, we were created in God's image and likeness. Our creativity is enabled by our capacity for critical thinking; if we were based on God, this indicates that our creativity comes from Him. However, I realized that this idea was \"idolatry\". This is because it acted as an \"invisible mirror\": speaking more of myself than of \"God\". I consider myself as an artist that works across many mediums: design, dance, writing, etc; I was projecting onto God the idea of creativity because it was something I wanted for myself. God is so much more than my experiences or desires.\n\nSo what is God's true nature? According to Marion, we can derive this through via negativa: a way of getting to know God by not knowing him. This can be applied to the criteria of being/existence and essence. One, being/existence: does God exist? We consider something to exist if it can be experienced by us in the planes of space and time. However, God is impossible to experience. If he can be experienced in these planes, this makes him limited. How does this apply to my \"idol\"? Let's consider works that are created by God, like nature and the Bible. These can be seen, touched, and studied by us. Thus, they are lacking depictions of God.\n\nTwo, essence: what is God? We can only understand something if we have a concept of it. However, God cannot be given any concept. As said by San Agustin, concepts about God that can be understood by us do not belong to God at all. How does this apply to my \"idol\"? We already have a concept of what a creative person looks like; if you ask a kid to draw this, they'll probably give you the image of a painter with a paintbrush, a musician with an instrument, a photographer with a camera, etc. This shows that we link a person's creativity to existing items: not just the tools they use, but also the outputs they produce. When we assume that God is creative, we box him in our definition of creativity. \n\nOverall, when it comes to God, we are left with the idea of impossibility. My idol showed me the limits of my experience and understanding, and God surpasses these. But I guess this makes my faith stronger. God may not be the creator I envisioned him to be, but his lack of limitations will continue to inspire me. \n\n\n###### Filipino\n\nPara sa akin, ang Diyos ay isang manlilikha, at siya ang pangunahing ugat ng pagkamalikhain. Nakabatay ito sa paniniwalang Kristiyano. Una, ginawa ang Diyos ng buong sanlibutan; maaaring nakikita ito sa kwento ng Genesis. Ikalawa, nilikha ang tao ayon sa larawan at wangis ng Diyos. Kaya natin maging malikhain dahil kaya natin ng kritikal na pag-iisip; kung bumatay tayo sa Diyos, galing ang aming pagkamalikhain sa kanya. Gayunman, nabatid ako na \"idolo\" lamang pala ang pagpapalagay ko sa Diyos kasi parang itong salamin ‚Äî itinuturo ito ang aking sarili imbes ng Diyos. Kinikilala ako bilang isang artista na lumilikha sa mga iba't ibang daluyan: disenyo, sayaw, sulat, at iba pa; ipinalagay ako ng ideya ng pagkamalikhain sa Diyos dahil marami akong alam tungkol dito, at ito ang gusto ko para sa sarili ko. Pero lumalampas ang Diyos sa aking mga karanasan at nais. \n\nAno ba talaga ang totoong ugali ng Diyos? Ayon kay Marion, pwede kami nawawari ito sa pamamagitan ng *via negativa*: isang pamaraan ng pagkilala sa Diyos sa pamamagitan ng hindi pagkilala sa kanya. Maaaring ito inilagay sa pamantayan ng pag-iral at esensya. Una, pag-iral: umiiral ba ang Diyos? Sa palagay namin, nag-iiral ang isang bagay kung pwede kami maranasan ito sa espasyo at panahon. Kaso ang Diyos ay imposibleng maransan. Kung pwede siya maranasan sa mga anyong nito, magiging limitado siya. Paano ito nakikita sa \"idolo\" ko? Isipin natin ang mga gawa ng \"Diyos\", tulad ng kalikasan at ang Bibliya. Maaari tayo nakikita, humahawak, at nagsusuri ang mga gawa na ito, kaya kulang sila bilang paglalarawan ng Diyos.\n\nIkalawa, esensya: ano ang Diyos? Kaya lang natin maiintindihan ng isang bagay kung meron tayong konsepto nito. Pero imposibleng mabigyan ng konsepto ang Diyos. Gaya ng sinabi ni San Agustin, hindi Diyos ang may-ari ng mga konsepto na pwede natin maiintindihan. Paano ito nakikita sa \"idolo\" ko? Mayroon na tayong konsepto ng manlilikha; kung hiniling ang isang bata na gumuhit nito, malamang gughit sila ng pintor na may pintura, musikero na may instrumento, o potograpo na may kamera. Nagpapakita ito na iniuugnay tayo ang pagkamalikhain ng isang tao sa mga konkretong gamit: ang mga kasangkapan at gawa niya. Kapag akala natin malikhain ang Diyos, ikinahon natin siya sa aming kahulugan ng pagmalikhain.\n\nSa huli, pagdating sa Diyos, matitira ang ideya ng imposibilidad. Tinuruan ng \"idolo\" ko sa akin ang mga limitasyon ng aking karanasan at pag-iintindihan kasi walang hangganan ang Diyos. Pero dahil dito, naging mas matibay ang aking pananampalataya. Maaaring hindi ang Diyos isang manlilikha, ngunit siya parin ang inspriasyon ko.\n\n\n\nPara sa akin, ang Diyos ang tunay na lumikha, at siya ang pangunahing pinagmumulan ng pagkamalikhain. Ang ideyang ito ay batay sa aking paniniwalang Kristiyano. Una, nilikha ng Diyos ang buong sansinukob; maaaring nakikita ito sa kuwento ng Genesis. Ikalawa, tayo ay nilikha ayon sa larawan at wangis ng Diyos. Kaya natin maging malikhain dahil kaya natin ng kritikal na pag-iisip; kung tayo ay batay sa Diyos, ito ay nagpapahiwatig na ang ating pagkamalikhain ay mula sa Kanya. Gayunpaman, napagtanto ko na ang ideyang ito ay \"idolatrya\" kasi parang itong salamin ‚Äî mas nagsasalita ito tungkol sa aking sarili kaysa sa \"Diyos\". Kinikilala ako bilang isang artista na lumilikha sa mga iba't ibang daluyan: disenyo, sayaw, sulat, at iba pa; ipinakita ko sa Diyos ang ideya ng pagkamalikhain dahil ito ay isang uri na gusto ko para sa aking sarili. Pero lumalampas ang Diyos sa aking mga karanasan at mga hangarin.\n\nKaya ano ba talaga ang totoong ugali ng Diyos? Ayon kay Marion, maaari nating makuha ito sa pamamagitan ng *via negativa*: isang paraan ng pagkilala sa Diyos sa pamamagitan ng hindi pagkilala sa kanya. Ito ay maaaring ilapat sa pamantayan ng pag-iral at esensya. Isa, pag-iral: umiiral ba ang Diyos? Itinuturing nating umiral ang isang bagay kung pwede natin mararanasan ito sa espasyo at panahon. Gayunpaman, imposibleng maranasan ng Diyos. Kung nararanasan siya sa mga anyong ito, nagiging limitado siya. Paano ito nalalapat sa aking \"idolo\"? Isaalang-alang natin ang mga gawang nilikha ng Diyos, tulad ng kalikasan at ang Bibliya. Maari tayo makikita, mahahawakan, at mapag-aaralan ang mga gawa na ito. Kaya, kulang sila sa mga paglalarawan ng Diyos. \n\nDalawa, esensya: ano ang Diyos? Maiintindihan lang natin ang isang bagay kung mayroon tayong konsepto nito. Gayunpaman, imposibleng mabigyan ng konsepto ang Diyos. Gaya ng sinabi ni San Agustin, ang mga konsepto tungkol sa Diyos na mauunawaan natin ay hindi pag-aari ng Diyos. Paano ito nalalapat sa aking \"idolo\"? Mayroon na tayong konsepto kung ano ang hitsura ng isang taong malikhain; kung hihilingin mo sa isang bata na iguhit ito, malamang na ibibigay nila sa iyo ang larawan ng isang pintor na may paintbrush, isang musikero na may instrumento, isang potograpo na may kamera, atbp. Ipinapakita nito na iniuugnay namin ang pagkamalikhain ng isang tao sa mga kasalukuyang gamit: ang mga kasangkapan at gawa niya. Kapag ipinapalagay natin na ang Diyos ay malikhain, ikinakahon natin siya sa ating kahulugan ng pagkamalikhain. \n\nSa huli, pagdating sa Diyos, naiwan tayo sa ideya ng imposibilidad. Ipinakita sa akin ng aking \"idolo\" ang mga limitasyon ng aking karanasan at pag-unawa, at nalampasan ng Diyos ang mga ito. Ngunit sa palagay ko ito ang nagpapatibay sa aking pananampalataya. Maaaring hindi ang Diyos ang manlilikha na naisip ko sa kanya, ngunit ang kanyang kakulangan sa mga limitasyon ay patuloy na nagbibigay-inspirasyon sa akin.\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T15:56:56.99213622Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2022-04-07":{"title":"2022-03-28","content":"## PHILO\n#philosophy #religion \n### Seksiyon III.

Hindi ko maikukulong ang Diyos sa isang pakakakilala lamang at hindi ko rin dapat asahan na ipapatupad Niya ang aking bawat hiling sa paraang gusto ko.

We try to understand God by coming up with concepts and definitions which are based on our experiences. However, these are limited to what we consider possible. According to Marion, what is impossible for us as mortals/human beings is possible for God; he surpasses all of our understanding. Believers like me will be trying to learn about God for our whole lives. I believe we'll only be able to do this if we let go of our conceptions of Him.\n\nBilang naniniwala sa Diyos: kung walang imposible sa Kanya, maaaring sabihin na tayo ang nagtatakda ng limitasyon sa Kanya.

Sacrificing something less (yourself) for something greater\n\t\t\t\t- CAVEAT: the claim that a relationship violates the human person is made more often than warranted\n- **This is the human reality that \"becomes\" a sacrament by virtue of the baptism of the parties**\n\t- Questions:\n\t\t- What does baptism \"do\" to effect this \"ontological\" change?\n\t\t- How does baptism do this?\n\t- Answers:\n\t\t- Baptism puts the life of the person on a ==different plane of meaning==\n\t\t- Through baptism, a person takes on the ==new responsibility of participating in the prophetic mission of Christ and of the church==\n\t\t- The marriage of baptized persons has a special meaning\n\t\t\t- See *Infra*\n\n#### The Sacramentality of Marriage\n- **Marriage in general (as a human and natural reality) in SS**\n\t- According to Genesis...\n\t\t- Man and woman are different ways of reflecting God's image\n\t\t- Their union in marriage is part of God's plan and is thus good\n\t- According to Hosea...\n\t\t- Marriage is seen as an apt symbol of the covenant between Yahweh (ever faithful one) and Israel\n\t\t- Prophet Hosea was held as a \"model\" because of his fidelity to his wife Gomer\n\t\t- When a person is baptized, he also assumes a prophetic function in the manner of Hosea, ==to witness to and remind the world of God's fidelity to his covenant==\n\t\t- What does the Hosea-Gomer event say about marriage in general?\n\t\t\t- Capacity of marriage to be an ==adequate and appropriate language to be a symbol of God's fidelity==\n\t\t\t- Spouses like Hosea have to be faithful....otherwise Yahweh could not speak through them and their marriage\n\t\t\t- Emphasizes necessity of human responsibility and cooperation with Yahweh\n\t\t\t- Hosea and Gomer: predecessor of Christian spouses\n\t- According to Mark...\n\t\t- context of conversation: divorce in the Old Testament (DIY divorce)\n\t\t- Jesus says no to this DIY divorce\n\t\t\t- Moses only allowed this because of the hardness of your heart...but this was not so from the beginning\n\t\t- Jesus: Marriage should be stable, not easily breakable, certainly not easily as the DIY divorce\n\t- Summary and Conclusion\n\t\t- Being male and female and their union in marriage is part of ==God's plan==\n\t\t- Marriage has the capacity to be a ==language==\n\t\t\t- Has the depth and richness to carry a meaning beyond the natural reality\n\t\t\t- Yahweh used the Hosea-Gomer marriage to reassure Israel of his unconditional fidelity\n\t\t- Quality of marriage affirmed by Jesus in Mark is its ==stability==\n\t\t\t- This makes marriage a maturing context even as a natural reality\n\t\t\t- This same quality makes marriage an appropriate symbol and witness to God's fidelity to its people\n- **Marriage as a Christian Sacrament (according to Ephesians)**\n\t- Overview\n\t\t- Paul reflects on the richness and depth of the reality of marriage, and attributes it to a special meaning\n\t\t- He interprets the \"human reality\" of marriage and sees God's presence and work in the loving, committed and responsible relationship between man and woman\n\t- Quotes\n\t\t- Genesis 2, 24:\n\t\t\t- Nobility of marriage ‚Äî one leaves his family of origin to start his/her own family\n\t\t\t- Equality of man and woman ‚Äî both man and woman shall leave their respective families, and now cling to each other\n\t\t- Mark 10: Jesus derived the conjclusion that ==what God has joined together, man must not separate== ‚Äî the stability/indissoulubility of marriage\n\t\t- Paul's take on this text: marriage is a great mystery which refers to ==Christ and the Church==\n\t- Mystery in Paul summary\n\t\t- Eph 5, 32: the word is used to refer to the comparison of marriage to the union of Christ and the Church\n\t\t- There is a great hidden truth being revealed in the committed one-flesh relationship between man and wife, and this truth refers to the ==relationship between Christ and the Church==\n\t\t- The relationship between H-W should reveal this truth about Christ and the Church\n\t\t- H-W, like the apostles, and Hosea and Gomer, ==participate in this prophetic mission to reveal God's fidelity to his people==\n\t- Theological Reflection\n\t\t- Introductory Comments\n\t\t\t- General\n\t\t\t\t- The structure of the sacrament: like fully human acts, there is a ==material form (sensate)== and a ==meaning (supra sensate)==\n\t\t\t\t\t- E.G. bread and wine -\u003e spiritual noruishment\n\t\t\t\t- There is a proportion of meaning and resonance between the symbol and the meaning\n\t\t\t\t- \"Symbol\" is not merely an external reality that stands in the place of its meaning as a substitute reality\n\t\t\t\t\t- E.G. blue eage on the facade of the gym, St. Ignatius Loyola kneeling down to offer his sword\n\t\t\t\t- The symbol has an ==intrinsic connection== with its meaning\n\t\t\t\t\t- E.G. flowers and gifts are symbols of your love\n\t\t\t\t\t- They are not mere external signs or labels of your love; they also make your love more real + deeper\n\t\t\t\t\t- \"Efficient\" signs that cause something in the relationship\n\t\t\t\t- The \"symbols\" in the sacraments were not Catholic inventions; they were taken over and transformed\n\t\t\t\t\t- E.G. Water and washing are human realities that lead themselves to symbolic interpretation\n\t\t\t\t\t- Old Testament: oil was used to anoint kings due to its preservative qualities\n\t\t\t\t\t- Chrisitanity took over these symbols and gave them new meaning\n\t\t\t- When we affirm that baptism, confirmation, Eucharist, marriage etc. are sacraments, we are affirming the ff. of them:\n\t\t\t\t- They are ==official acts of the Church==\n\t\t\t\t- They are a means to ==accomplish the mission of Christ== (salvific/redemptive)\n\t\t\t\t- They are a ==language== through which God speaks to us that we may know him better, a deeper heart-knowledge of God (revelatory)\n\t\t\t- Marriage was the last sacrament to be recognized as an official act of the Church due to some theological difficulties (not yet fully resolved)\n\t\t\t\t- What is the human reality that becomes a sacrament? Theological consenseus: ==the entire life of the spouses becomes the sacrament, not just the ceremony in the Church==\n\t\t\t\t\t- In the beginning, there was no (Catholic) ritual for marraige. The husband and wife just moved in togetehr and they were accepted as married by the community\n\t\t\t\t- Objection: Marriage includes sexual relations and sex can only be justified when done for procreation; but sex in marriage is not only for procreation so it is actually an opportunity for sin\n\t\t\t- a\n\t\t- Marriage as a Sacrament\n\t\t\t- Marriage is an ACT of the CHURCH\n\t\t\t\t- Marriage is a human reality that many people engage in and live, not just Christians\n\t\t\t\t\t- Love each other, raise their kids, fulfill their responsibiltiies, mature and become better persons...\n\t\t\t\t- When a person is baptized, he is incorporated into the community of the Chruch...==his entire life ‚Äî actions, loving, being, growing ‚Äî is collocated on a different plane==\n\t\t\t\t\t- E.G. identifying as Atenean, or joining the Glee Club\n\t\t\t\t- A baptized person assumes his repsonsibilities as a member of the Church...marriage specifices the general responsibility assumed in baptism\n\t\t\t\t- Christ speaks through the community of the Church to the world\n\t\t\t\t\t- He shows his fidelity to his people, his desire to save and to draw us to the fullness that he offers\n\t\t\t\t- By baptism, the baptized's married life becomes a language of Christ and the Church\n\t\t\t\t\t- It is not just their own life, but also of the Church to which they belong\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- E.G. being a Glee Club singer\n\t\t\t- Marriage is SALVIFIC\n\t\t\t\t- The historical development of the question\n\t\t\t\t\t- Augustine/1\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- Literal truth of Genesis 3: there were no uncontrolable passions because everything was according to reason/will of God; sex was only for procreation\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- The first sin created a rupture between man and God, between man and his better self\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- Breakdown in man's wholeness -\u003e man finds himself drawn to different directions\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- Paul: I do what I do not want to do and don't do what I really want to do\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- The disruption of the relation between God and man also happened internally to man\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- Concupscience (state of rebellion of man against God) took this form: the sex act was now governed by pleasure rather than the desire to cooperate with God's will\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- Sex in marriage is not always for procreation...sex is inevitable in marriage, thus sin is inevitable in marriage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- Marriage is the default vocation of the weak\n\t\t\t\t\t- Augustine/2\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- Over time, his theology softened\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- Marriage could be salvific in a negative sense\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- Each man should have his own wife...do not deprive one another so that Satan may not tempt you\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- Sex is limited to one's partner, making it less frequent\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- Marriage is redemptive in a negative sense\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- it limits sinfulness\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- it is a damage control measure\n\t\t\t\t\t- Gaudium et spes\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- The intimate partnership of life and love is rooted in the ==contract of the partners==, in their ==irrevocable consent==\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- Married love is uniquely expressed and perfected in the marraige act\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- noble and honorable\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- the truly human performance of these acts fosters the self-giving they signify and enriches the spouses in joy and gratitude\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- These paradigm-changing insights concern:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- the understanding of marriage from *contract* (exchange of rights) to consortium totius vitae\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- breaks new ground in understanding the meaning of the sexual act\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- Augustine: \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- original justice: procreation was faithful to God's intention\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- original sin: pleasure is sinful\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- GS: the marital act ==expresses conjugal love and perfects the love== between husband and wife\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- Comments about GS:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- enlarged the understanding of marriage ==from mere contract to a life-partnership==\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- contract: rights, sexual rights\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- marriage: unrecognizable as a relationship between friends\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- Contract model saw sexual act as a right (biological POV). Considered moral when intended for procreation. Sexual act was sole ingredient of marriage, unrelated to other realities (e.g. care, understanding, responsibility, friendship)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- Contract model is reflected in discipline of Catholic Church\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- E.G. minimum age for marriage (14 for girls and 16 for boys)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- marriage is dissolved if not consummated\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- physical impotence is an impediment to marriage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- Offers a broader and more human understanding as an intimate life-partnership\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- composed of many ingredientts like communication, trust, etc\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- not monolithic, but multifaceted\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- In this context, the sexual act ==can attain and be understood in all its depth and richness==\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- The marital act expresses and perfects the love of the spouses. It's not an isolated reality; ==its meaning is rooted in and arises from the life/love of the spouses==\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- sacramental structure: if the love is real, it must be expressed in an external way. at the same time, the external expression (as a sign) is set apart by the meaning it bears\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- Remember FC: a person is a body informed by an immortal spirit, and a spirit that expresses itself in a body\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- Sexual acts are fully human only if they are part of the love by which man and woman commit themselves to each other\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- The meaning of the act is not only in the act but in the life they live. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- Not merely a passing, momentary pleasure\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- 3rd possible meaning for the sexual act: expression and perfection of love.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- The effect and cause of deeper love\n\t\t\t\t- In what way is marriage said to be salvific/redemptive?\n\t\t\t\t\t- Thesis:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- There's a proportion and similarity in meaning between the ==natural reality (symbol) and the sacred (revealed)==\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- E.G. preservative quality of oil -\u003e preservation of new life; bread and wine -\u003e spiritual nourishment\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- Spouses can become better persons ‚Äî ==marriage is a context in which spouses mature and grow==; they can learn to love and sacrifice\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- \"Becoming better persons\": good human quality to symbolize and make concrete \"salvation\" understood as fuller life with God\n\t\t\t\t\t- More positive interpretation of marriage is in response to what Waite and Gallagher call ==\"Myths of post-marriage culture\"==\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- Divorce is usually the best answer for kids when the marriage becomes unhappy. *But is divorce always the best answer?*\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- Marriage is all about children; if there's none, spouses may as well break up. But marriage is not all about children; *getting and staying married has a powerful effect on the well-being of adults*\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- Rebutting the claim that marriage may be good for men but bad for women\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- Promoting marriage and marital obligation puts women at risk for domestic violence, and divorce can help women escape this; W and G cite a lot of studies that counter this\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- Marriage is a private matter, and no outsider should be allowed to interfere...\n\t\t\t\t\t- Practical consequences of this deconstruction:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- As marriage ceases to be vital to children, single motherhood is elevated in status. It's no longer just a family tragedy; it's just another personal option in a freedom loving world\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- Higher expectations of marriage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- Marriage becomes just one of the equally valid lifestyles\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- Marriage is demoted from uniquely honored relationship -\u003e one of the possibile relationships (and no one should interfere)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- For law practitioners: marriage is a part of continuum of commitment ratehr than a distinctive and distinct relationship\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- At the heart of this deconstruction: ==the attempt to demote marriage from a unique public commitment (supported by law, custom, society, religion) to a private relationship terminable at will==\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- This demotion is done in the name of choice and freedom, but ==reimagining marriage as a purely private relation does not expand anyone's choices==\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- Instead, it takes away from the individual marriage itself: the choice to enter a uniquely powerful and life-enhancing bond\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- way more durable than the immediate shifting feelings of two persons\n\t\t\t\t\t- The Marriage Bargain: Is marriage a public institution governed by laws and supported by society?

This is responsibility assumed\n\t\t\t\t- Baptism: all Christians take on the responsibility to ==share the prophetic mission of Christ== as a member of the Christian community\n\t\t\t\t- This general responsibility is specified by the vocation, way of life we choose ‚Äî married couples, single, religious, priests\n- **The Role of Faith**\n\t- The difficulty raised by Mackin: ==the sacramentality of marraige seems \"automatic\", almost \"magical\"==\n\t\t- as if all one needs to do is to be baptized (C. 1055. 2)\n\t- The popular belief: our marriage is unhappy because we have not received God's blessing\n\t- Faith\n\t\t- Man's COMPREHENSIVE \"yes\" to God's revelation of himself and of his saving plan for us\n\t\t- Includes many elements, engages all the human faculties\n\t- Faith and the Sacrament\n\t\t- The sacrament is primarily the ==\"act of God\"== (according to the DSD no. 46)\n\t\t\t- It is God's action in the ritual, God animates the fusion (of the human act and the cultural symbol) with his intention and meaning\n\t\t\t- He uses this fusion to do good things in the participants, acting in their whole persons in an effort to draw them to Himself\n\t\t- As an act of God, the sacrament therefore implies certanity, regarding which, the following must be said:\n\t\t\t- The CERTANITY PRINCIPLE (\"opus operatum\" or \"ex opere operato\")\n\t\t\t\t- It is God himself who works in the human reality\n\t\t\t\t- Not the priest who merely acts as an agent/intermediary\n\t\t\t\t- Not the ritual or the symbolic act\n\t\t\t- But emphasis on the certanity principle (that it is God himself who works in the sacraments) led to certain exaggerations that ignored the human responsibility and cooperation dimension\n\t\t\t\t- E.G. master of ceremonies turned missal to wrong page\n\t\t\t\t- This led to Mackin's criticism\n\t\t\t- Augustine and Pelagius' clarification: men are graced not against their will but according ot their cooperation\n\t\t\t\t- The water tank image?\n\t\t\t\t- Self-righteousness: the sin against the Holy Spirit (see Matthew 12, 32)\n\t\t\t\t- Jesus at the door (Rev 3, 20)\n\t- Faith and the Sacrament of Marriage\n\t\t- the intention to participate in any sacrament -\u003e the intention to participate in a ==\"human ritual/reality\"== in which we believe ==Christ is present and working==\n\t\t\t- Christian marriage: the intention to participate in the human reality of marriage acknowledged explicitly as a XT event (i..e. in which Christ works and is present to reveal and to save)\n\t\t- This intention is directed by a ==FAITH that BELIEVES in God who reveals himself in Jesus Christ==, who lives and works in the Church, a Church which continues his presence and work in the world precisely through human realities\n\t\t- Thus, the necessity of baptism ‚Äî not merely in the fact of baptism, but baptism that is ==lived in our daily life==\n\t\t- Thus, not AUTOMATIC\n\t\t\t- it is a ==human endeavor to cooperate==\n\t\t\t- and so, ==human responsibility==\n\t\t\t- \"Man is graced not against his will but according to his cooperation\"\n- **Summary and Conclusion**: Difference between sacramental and non-sacramental marraige\n\t- The difference is on the ==level of meaning== , not on the level of empirical reality. \n\t\t- The marraige between the baptized is not necessarily better, or that between non-baptized necessarily worse, or little chance of success\n\t- On the level of meaning: the baptized spouses are aware of ==another level of meaning, of an added responsibility==\n\t- The witness of Christian spouses is clearer in this sense: ==it is not an individual/isolated \"statement\" but a witness of communities==...\n\t\t- ...all over the world and over time, of many people striving to remain faithful to each other, struggling to be good parents, striving to form their children in the values of Christ\n\t\t- We see couples encouraging and helping each other fulfill their responsibilties (e.g. Marriage encounter)\n\t- Because there is an added meaning, there is another level of responsibility incumbent upon the Christian spouses. Their married life is not just a natural reality but also a ==ministry, a participation in the salvific mission of Christ==\n\t\t- There is an awareness of the need to ==open== their hearts and minds, their dispositions, their marriage ‚Äî their entire being and relationship ‚Äî ==to God's grace and transforming action==\n\t\t- E.G. We study harder for a final exam because it has heavier weight; the Blue Eagles practice more seriously and play with greater effort and hassle in the finals than in elimniations. This is because of the ADDED meaning\n\t\t- The certainity principle means that ==God's presence and grace is most certainly present== in the \"pipelines\", and our stance is that of ==openness to God's action, our responsibility is that we desire that He act in our hearts and in our lives.== But God does not bulldoze his way into our hearts and sanctify and save us whether we like it or not. Thus, ==we are graced not against our will but according to our cooperation.==\n\n---\n#### Orals\n**Guidelines:**\n- 10 MINUTES MAX\n- Introduce your thesis by talking about its location/context in the chapter (what went before, what follows)\n\n**Thesis:**\nMarriage is a Christian sacrament‚Äîan official act of  the Church; it is revelatory; it is redemptive/salvific. The redemptive capacity of marriage underwent a development, from  Augustine/1, Augustine/2, and finally to the game changing   insights of Gaudium et Spes 48-49.\n\n\n**Outline:**\n1. Provide thesis and its context\n\t1. General topic: the sacramentality of marriage\n\t2. What went before: Marriage in general in SS (old testament stories)?\n\t3. What went after: Waite and Gallagher on myths of post marriage culture (practical application)\n2. Expound on redemptive capacity of marriage\n\t1. It helps spouses become better persons by providing them a context in which spouses mature and grow, by learning to love and to sacrifice\n\t2. It is a human reality in which believers see and recognize that God is present, and is working in a very special and palpable way\n\t3. The symbolization makes our  \"salvation\" with God more concrete -\u003e with God, we have fuller lives\n3. How did the redemptive capacity of marriage develop? (main)\n\t1. Augustine/1: Marriage is seen as the default vocation of the weak\n\t\t1. Genesis 3: there were no uncontrollable passions because everything was according to the reason/will of God\n\t\t\t1. sex was only for procreation; this is faithful to God's intention\n\t\t2. After the occurence of the first sin, which created a rupture between man and God, sex became an act governed by pleasure, instead of the desire to cooperate with God's will\n\t\t\t1. Manifestation of concupscience (tendency of man to sin; state of rebellion of man against God)\n\t\t\t2. Pleasure is sinful\n\t\t3. Sex in marriage isn't always for procreation -\u003e sex is inevitable in marriage -\u003e sin is inevitable in marriage\n\t2. Softened in Augustine/2: Marriage could be salvific/redemptive in a negative sense. How?\n\t\t1. Each man should have his own wife...do not deprive one another so that Satan may not tempt you\n\t\t2. Sex is limited to your exclusive partner, making it less frequent\n\t\t3. Limits sinfulness\n\t\t4. Damage control measure\n\t\t5. This can be seen in historical context: marriage was seen as a contract model\n\t\t\t1. Utilitarian + objective; collective needs \u003e individual needs\n\t\t\t\t1. E.G. acquring good in-laws, increasing family labot\n\t\t\t2. Sexual act was seen as a right (biological POV)\n\t\t\t3. Sexual act was sole ingredient of marriage, unrelated to other realities (e.g. care, understanding, responsibility, friendship)\n\t3. Gaudium et Spes 48-49: \n\t\t1. Overview:\n\t\t\t1. Marriage is expanded from mere contract model to life partnership. A broader and more human understanding\n\t\t\t2. Foundation of relationship is still the partners' contract, their irrevocable consent\n\t\t\t3. Expansion: The marital act expresses and perfects the love of the spouses. \n\t\t\t\t1. How? the truly human performance of the act fosters the self-giving they signify and enriches the spouses in joy and gratitude\n\t\t\t\t\t1. Consortium totius vitae: reciprocal self-giving of the spouses\n\t\t\t\t2. It is no longer an isolated reality; its meaning is rooted in and arises from the life/love of the spouse\n\t\t\t\t\t1. Remember: marriage is a sacrament. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t1. If the love is real, it must be expressed in an external way.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t2. At the same time, the external expression (as a sign) is set apart by the meaning it bears\n\t\t\t\t\t2. Sexual acts are fully human only if they are a part of the love where man and woman commit themselves to each other\n\t\t\t\t\t3. The meaning of the act is not only in the act but in the life they live. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t1. not just passing pleasure\n4. Summary and Conclusion\n\t1. As a Christian sacrament, marriage has the capacity to redeem us from not just sin, but from a reality where we're disconnected w/ God\n\t2. However, it wasn't always seen this way; exemplified by Augustine's writings, marriage was seen as an environment that encouraged sin because it enabled sexual acts -\u003e individualistic pleasure\n\t3. Thanks to Gaudium et Spes, we understand marriage as a partnership, one of reciprocal self-giving. Now, these marital acts are seen as expressions + perfections of the spouses' love because they foster this self-giving. Not just limited to the act; their lives are also enriched with joy and gratitude. Hence its redemptive capacity.","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T15:56:56.99613631Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2022-04-26":{"title":"2022-04-26","content":"## Philo 12\n#philosophy #religion \n### Balangkas\n#### Modyl 5: Pakikibagay sa Pagsubok\n**A.

And these silences are everywhere. Films, news, literature, science, city planning, economics, the stories we tell ourselves about our past, present and future, are all marked ‚Äì disfigured ‚Äì by a female-shaped ‚Äúabsent presence‚Äù. This is the gender data gap.\n\n\n\u003e For these women, the consequences of living in a world built around male data can be deadly.\n\n\u003e The gender data gap is both a cause and a consequence of the type of unthinking that conceives of humanity as almost exclusively male.\n\n\u003e Designers may believe they are making products for everyone, but in reality they are mainly making them for men.

In order to make this point stronger, the article is framed to spotlight the dangers of male-centered design. This was done by focalizing the perspectives of women, so that we, the audience, can fully empathize with them. A variety of examples were given, ranging from the gadgets they use to the workplaces they occupy (i.e. the size of phones being too large to the temperatures of offices being too low). These were backed by studies and statistics, like the accuracy rate of speech recognition software (70% better for men) and the likelihood of injury and death in a car crash (47% and 17%, respectively). Here, we can see intertextuality at work; referencing to outside texts shows us the gravity of these design decisions. I appreciate this kind of focalization because it gives attention to minorities: not just women, but also people who are POC, LGBTQIA+, neurodivergent, etc. This may seem biased to others (e.g. the counter \"All Lives Matter\" to \"Black Lives Matter\"). However, I believe this kind of focalization is needed because we live in an inequitable world where some types of people are more privileged than othrs; thus, it's important to spotlight perspectives that are undervalued.\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T15:56:56.99613631Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2022-05-02":{"title":"2022-05-02","content":"## PHILO 12\n#philosophy #religion \n### 6.01 Pagtatakda, Paglalarawan \u0026 Pagsasapormula\n*Restriction, Illustration and Formulation*\n*Sakop na bahagi ng teksto | ¬ß¬ß28-34, pp.102-105*\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDk4Vi-l53U\n#### Noto\n- Hal.

Ngunit tanggihan o iwasan man natin ito, tila walang pagmamahalan ang maaaring makatakas sa paparating na pagwawalay na dala ng kamatayan.\n- At kung ang aking pag-asa ay isang pag-asa sa aking mga kaibigan at minamahal na siya ring mamamatay, nagiging posible pa ba ang pag-asa?\n- Ngunit tanong ni Marcel,¬†**\"Pagkanag-iisa ba ang huling salita?\"**¬†(¬ß58, p.122). Ang lahat nga ba ng ating pagkakaibigan at pagmamahalan ay humahantong lamang sa pagpapaalam? Tila taliwas din ito sa ating karanasan. \n- Bakit may nararanasan tayong ==isang¬†**uri ng katibayan**¬†sa ating pagbubuklod sa iba?== Bakit tila kapag may katapatan ang pagmamahal natin sa isang tao, nadarama natin na tila ==hindi ito maaaring matapos, na tila walang hangganan ito?== Paano maaaring unawain kung gayon ang nararanasan nating¬†**katotohanan**¬†ng ating pagbubuklod sa ating mga kaibigan kung ito pala ay simula‚Äôt sapul hahantong lamang sa pagkawasak?\n\n### Lecture Notes\n- pakikiapagkapuwa-looban\n- have u ever experienced gratitutde in the midst of darkness? this is ==collateral beauty==\n\t- E.G. spending time with your loved ones during the pandemic\n- Our loved ones have limitations too; hangganan/limitasyon\n\n\u003e \"==Inaasahan kita alang-alang sa amin.==\" Iyan, marahil, ang pinakatumpak na paglahad at pagsasabalangkas sa kilos at gawa na taglay...ng salitang 'umasa.' \"==Kita...sa amin.==\" Ang tigas-ulong tiyaga sa pagmumuni-muni lamang ang makapaglilitaw, mula sa kilos ng umaasa, sa 'kita' at 'kami' na iyan.

It means ==being faithful==. If we have a close relationship, there'll always be times when we have shortcomings...a friendship is only strong if we remain faithful throughout all these times\n\t- We are able to make a horizon where the good within each other triumphs\n\t- This is ==fidelity==\n- Through fidelity to a human being, I become aware of the presence of an absolute Thou\n\t- absolute = fullness, overflowing, so great I cannot conceive of it...but I am aware of it\n\t- Marcel: \"The cement which binds us together...we are faithful to each other because in our fragility, there is an absolute Thou who in his presence binds us together like cement. He's the one who cements us\"\n\t- This absolute Thou is the ground ==(the cement)== of our home\n- Our temptations to despair have most often to do with our relations with others... E.G. when the people we love die...but the absolute Thou is what lets us keep hope\n\t- Marcel: if I am faithful to a friend, and vice versa, then I can experience my friend as ==immortal==. To love somebody, Marcel says, is to be able to say ‚ÄòYou at least will not die'‚Äù. \n\t- Not because I am a spoiled child who does not want to accept death, but because having been faithful or having tried one's best to be faithful to a fellow human being...the goodness, depth and the reality of the fellow human being has been experienced by one, and one is aware that ==goodness cannot simply be destroyed.==\n\t- And so one faces the death of that fellow human being, but is aware that the ==death is simply not the last word==\n\t- This comes from the perspective of...not as a small child refusing to accept reality, but as a human being who is ==faithful to the reality he has experienced==\n\t- Why ==AT LEAST==?\n\t\t- He has not experienced everybody, but he has experienced at least this one person\n\t\t- And he's aware that this one person is immortal\n\t\t- But he says at least because then he suspects...perhaps everybody is like that too...also immortal, also cannot die\n- Thus, part of being faithful is ==the refusal to yield to the temptation to give up==\n\t- The refusal to say \"Okay, life is really like that...that's the end of everything\"\n\t- Fidelity is not something that depends on me...it is the very ==goodness, depth, and richness== of what I have experienced calls me to be faithful to it\n\t- It is a call which if I do not answer, I am unfaithful. It's a call to be answered in fidelity\n- The presence of the absolute Thou makes me realize that it's not only a matter of being faithful to my friend, but also to be faithful to the absolute Thou, who is ==the cement which holds us together.==\n\t- Marcel: We always have this temptation...to yield to say...darkness is the last word, life has no meaning, to lose hope...==to yield to this temptation is to be unfaithful to the absolute Thou== who holds together the limited and finite thou that we human beings are to each other\n\t- No matter how hopeless things seem to be, there's always this call to be faithful to one's friends. And then to other human beings too. Because if one is faithful to one's friends, one gets the gift of being able to realize that ==even the human beings who are not once friends are also immortal. ==\n- Marcel's remarks\n\t-  One cannot hope without constantly ==overcoming the temptation to despair==\n\t\t- We always have this temptation\n\t- Hope is a kind of a tension between the ==horizon of the infinite== and the ==early detail of the finite. ==\n\t\t- E.G. father whose son has gone off to the war and from whom he has not heard anything\n\t\t- In the infinite horizon, he believes that he will see his son again. if not in this life, in the life to come\n\t\t- But in the finite life, he longs to see his son right here on earth.\n\t\t- And hope moves in both of them\n\t\t\t- He's aware that he will see his son again in the life to come\n\t\t\t- But part of hope is to continue longing to see his son in this life... to continue looking for him, to continue praying to see him\n\t\t- In other words, Marcel's philosophy is different from the philosophy of those who would say: \"Let's have closure now\"\n\t\t\t- There is no closure. But that does not mean to say that there should be a constant agony, but they're a constant hope...even in the finite, from which nothing has been heard\n\t- What shall it be like when we finally ==enter the horizon of the absolute Thou?==\n\t\t- He uses Greek word: ŒΩœåœÉœÑŒøœÇ (nostos)\n\t\t\t- a common theme in Greek literature that is used to describe a hero's journey home.\n\t\t\t- Filipino word is pag-uwi: What Filipinos feel ==going home==\n\t\t\t- Going home: we have been away from it, but we've been carrying it within ourselves, and now at last we've arrived. I've returned to the familiar. I've returned to where I've always been, to where I've always wanted to be.\n\t\t\t- at the same time, it would also be an experience, and an experiencing of something new\n\t- Hope in myself is always ==faithfulness==\n\t\t- I can hope, and I can always overcome the temptation the darkness is final....\n\t\t- overcoming it through fidelity, through faithfulness...to our friends...and to an absolute Thou\n\n#### Sagutin \n\u003e _Tanong 1_: Ipaliwanag at pagmunihan ang linyang ito mula sa lektura ni Padre Roque Ferriols: ‚ÄúTo love somebody, Marcel says, is to be able to say ‚ÄòYou at least will not die'‚Äù (05:10-05:19).\n\n\u003e _Tanong 2_: Ipaliwanag at pagmunihan ang linyang ito mula sa lektura ni Padre Roque Ferriols: ‚ÄúHope is a kind of a tension between the horizon of the infinite and the earthly detail of the finite‚Äù (13:20-13:42).\n\n\n**Balangkas:**\n- Tanong: ‚ÄúHope is a kind of a tension between the horizon of the infinite and the earthly detail of the finite‚Äù \n- Hope operates in two realms:\n\t- Earthly detail of the finite: where possibilities are limited\n\t\t- It is often us people who put up limitations...setting up expectations on what should happen and when\n\t\t- In this view, experiences are established already based on calculations\n\t\t- This can be seen in \"Umaasa ako na...\"\n\t- Horizon of the infinite: where the possibilities are endless\n\t\t- as a method of surpassing, hope often exceeds our expectations\n\t\t- When we hope, we believe that it'll happen, even if we don't know HOW. \n\t\t- In this views, experiences are still being shaped\n\t\t- This can be seen in \"Umaasa ako...\"\n- The tension of hope is best seen in disappointment. Example: the father whose son has gone off to the war and from whom he has not heard anything\n\t- But in the finite life, he longs to see his son right here on Earth, in his life...\n\t\t- Notice how there is a set time and place\n\t- In the infinite horizon, he believes that he will see his son again. If not in this life, in the life to come\n\t- Recall that last sentence. The father easily could've succumbed to despair if he certainly claimed that he would see his son during his lifetime on Earth. Instead, he opened himself up to endless possibilities, one of which includes another liftime. As a hopeful person, the father is divided between his earthly desires and his acceptance of the unknown.\n\t- It is hope that motivates him to continue looking and praying for his son. There is no guarantee that he'll get closure.\n\t- Here, we see fidelity. To hope is to be faithful to someone, and part of being faithful is the refusal to give up.\n\t-  \"Umaasa ako sa Iyo.\"\n- Summary: \n\t- When we're able to contemplate dualities, we let go of the need for certanity. And this humbles us. \n\t- I believe that this humility can help us make better decisions in life.\n\n**Speech:**\n\nAno ang ibig sabihin ng \"Hope is a kind of tension between the horizon of the infinite and the earthly detail of the finite?\" Sa pananaw ko, nakikita sa linyang ito ang kahalagahan ng mga magkaugma na kabaligtaran. Walang pag-asa kung walang kadiliman; meron tayong konsepto ng walang hangganan dahil magintindihan tayo ng konsepto ng limitasyon.\n\nKumikilos ang pag-asa sa mga kabaligtaran na ito. Sa mundo ng tao,  may limitasyon ang mga posibilidad. Itinatag at naayos na ang mga karanasan kasi binabatay ito sa mga kalkulasyon: kung ano at kailan ang dapat mangyari sa hinaharap. Sa isang banda, may malawak na abot-tanaw na walang hangganan sa posibilidad. Dito, hinuhubog ba ang mga karanasan dahil palagi humihigit ang mga inaasahan ng tao ang pag-asa, bilang metodo ng paglampas. Kaya, walang pakialam ang pag-asa sa kalulasyon, o sa ibang salita, sa *papaano*.\n\nMadalas na nakikita ang pag-asa sa pagkabigo, tulad sa halimbawa ni Fr. Ferriols: pumunta ang anak sa giyera, at wala pang narining ang kanyang ama mula sa kanya. Sa buhay ng ama (na may hangganan), gusto niyang makita ang kanyang anak ngayon, sa mundong ito. May  nakatakdang panahon at lugar. Sa abot-tanaw ng walang hangganan, naniniwala siya na makikita niya ulit ang anak niya. Kung hindi ngayon, (sa habang-buhay na ito), sa hinaharap na lang (o sa darating na habang-buhay). \n\nKung sigurado ng ama na makikita niya ang kanyang anak sa panahon ng kanyang buhay sa mundo, maaaring madaling sumuko ang ama. Pero naging bukas ang isip niya sa mga iba't ibang possibilidad, katulad ng ibang habang-buhay. Bilang taong umaasa, dumadanas ang ama ng dalawang kabaligtaran: ang kanyang mga makamundong nais at ang kanyang pagtanggap sa lingid na hinaharap.\n\nDahil sa pag-asa, nagpatuloy siya naghahanap at nagdadasal para sa anak niya, kahit walang garantiya. Dito, maaaring makikita ang katapatan. Ang pagiging umaasa ay ang pagiging tapat sa aming kapwa, at ang pagiging tapat ay ang pagtanggi na sumuko sa matagal na kadiliman. \"Umaasa ako sa Iyo, kahit anong mangyari sa atin.\" \n\nAno ang pwede nating natutunan dito? Kapag tayo tumatanggap ng kabaligtaran nang sabay-sabay, binitawan natin ang aming nais para sa katiyakan. Naniniwala ako na nagtutulong ang pagpapakumbaba na ito sa amin; mas handa na tayong harapin ng halihaw sa mundo.\n\n\n\nThe father easily could've succumbed to despair if he was certain that he would see his son during his lifetime on Earth. Instead, he opened himself up to endless possibilities, one of which includes another lifetime. \nBilang taong umaasa, dumadanas ang ama ng dalawang kabaligtaran: ang kanyang mga makamundong nais at ang kanyang pagtanggap sa lingid na hinaharap.\n\nBecause of hope, he continues looking and praying for his son, even if there's no guarantee that he'll get closure. Here, we see fidelity. To hope is to be faithful to someone, and part of being faithful is the refusal to give up even during dark times. \"Umaasa ako sa Iyo, kahit anong mangyari sa atin.\" \n\nWhat can we take away from this? When we're able to simultaneously contemplate dualities, we let go of the need for certanity, which humbles us. And I believe that this humility can help us navigate life better in a polarizing world. \n\n\n\n\n#### Pagmarka\n- Tumpak, malinaw, maayos at kung sakali‚Äôy may kabatiran ang sinulat, binahagi, o binigayna sagot sa tanong ng guro. \n- May malinaw na ebidensiya na nakilala, naunawaan, at gamay ng mag-aaral ang ideya/paksa na tinutukoy ng takdang aralin, kasama ang pinakamahalagang mga detalye nito. \n- Hindi naging paligoy-ligoy ang sinabi o binahagi.

It is responsible for birthing realities and even denying them depending on how well we can use or manipulate them.¬†In its barest sense, language refers to the meaning-making tools we use to communicate. In this lecture, we discuss how language serves as a system where we experience reality.\n\n##### Notes\n- **Rhetoric**\n\t- study of figures\n- Figurative meaning heavily relies on the connections that got built up over time\n\t- Since they contain within them a history, they change meaning throughout time\n\n#### Figurative Language and Rhetoric\nIn the previous section, we discussed how language has the power to not only shape but to create realities. However, there is also the truth that with it comes the power to produce realities that are loaded with biases. The challenge then is to produce new meanings and shape an alternate reality with the help of language's dynamic nature.\n\n##### Notes\n- rhetoric is how language persuades\n- biases are built into our language\n\n#### Language and Framing\nSo, we already know that language is a part of our sociopolitical and sociocultural fabric and because of that, the words that we use are not simply words. Because they carry biases within them, they are ideologically charged. How do we then detect ideology in language? The (last) lecture embedded below discusses this and more.\n##### Notes\n- ideology will show you an ordering of the world based on the differences of people\n- will put forward a moral/ethical position\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AevWkp9uRfA\n\n#### Summary\n**BIG CONCEPTS ABOUT LANGUAGE, IDEOLOGY \u0026 NARRATIVES**\n-   By language, we don't just mean words but images, gestures, and other semantic systems. It is a ==system where meanings are created, negotiated, valued, and even devalued.¬†==\n-   The way we use language is ==a way of framing.== In this perspective, language also contributes the ==unequal social relations.==\n-   Although language reflects reality, it is also responsible for creating, shaping, and influencing it.\n-   Figurative language is found everywhere--not just in poetry, but in ==our everyday strife.==\n-   Language is nearly everything and what we say about something helps shape the way we view something. Therefore, it is important to always ask ourselves: ==is my language aligned to the values and principles of civility, compassion, and social justice?== Or am I helping contribute to the great divide and perennial inequality?","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T15:56:56.99613631Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2022-05-16":{"title":"2022-05-16","content":"## Theo 13\n#philosophy #religion \n### Chapter 3: Towards a Moral Theology\n- 3 parts:\n\t- \"Micro\" approach\n\t- \"Macro\" approach\n\t- Applying these 2 approaches to sexual questions\n- When we think of sin, we usually think in terms of ==what we do== (micro)\n- But our actions do not simply in the realm of actions that come and go. They affect also the ==kind of person that we become== (macro).\n- WE BECOME WHAT WE REPEATEDLY DO.\n\n#### The \"Micro\" Approach ‚Äî Looking at the ACT\n*O'Neill and Black, Responding to Love in Love*\n\n- Distinction between a **human act** and a **non-human act** is based on ==freedom and knowledge.== \n\t- Expound: The more freedom + the greater the knowledge, the more human the act is; the less freedom + knowledge (e.g. person was forced, reflex act; I didn't know what I was doing, a little kid breaking something), the less human the act is. \n\t- Concerning KNOWLEDGE\n\t\t- not just consciousness (like sleepwalking), but also the knowledge that he is acting\n\t\t- Also awareness of the virtue/evil that he is doing\n\t\t- This clarity is not always present in moral matters; this lack is exemplified in the difference between ==\"head\" knowledge== (what I know) and ==\"heart knowledge\"== (what is important to me, what I value, what determines what I do)\n\t\t- What I know does not always govern/affect what I do\n\t- Concerning FREEDOM \n\t\t- inadequate understanding\n\t\t\t- freedom as the ability to do as one chooses/pleases\n\t\t\t- freedom from restraint, the less restraint, the more freedom\n\t\t\t- freedom as the ability to choose one over the other\n\t\t- a more adequate understanding of freedom\n\t\t\t- freedom is not an end/value in itself, but only instrumental\n\t\t\t- ==ability and responsibility== to direct our lives in accordance with ==our meaning and purpose==\n\t\t\t- does not exist in a vacuum, but in the context of what we understand to be our vocation, ==a Christian anthropology==\n\t\t\t- not only the ability to choose what I do, but also and especially what I would like to become\n\t\t\t- Freedom is therefore exercised on two levels:\n\t\t\t\t- ==what I do== ‚Äî doing good and avoiding evil (categorical)\n\t\t\t\t- ==what I become== ‚Äî becoming conformed to the image of God in whom I was created (transcendental)\n\t\t\t- John Paul II: acting is morally good when the choices of freedom conform with man's true good; the choices we make express the ==voluntary ordering of the person towards ultimate good==\n\t\t\t- Freedom is the ==pursuit of the ultimate good==, what God has created us to become, the best version of ourselves; it is the pursuit of excellence (MAGIS)\n\t- Freedom is related to \"virtues\" or good stable habits\n\t\t- E.G. bad habit of overeating: it's a habit not because it's one-time act, but a persistent pattern...it doesn't tend towards the authentic good of the over-eater\n\t\t- Virtue as a stable habit begins with ==particular acts repeated over time.==\n\t\t- Particular acts eventually lead to the formation of the virtue/habit; the habit makes the doing of particular acts easier; repeated acts strengthen the virtue/habit. Thus, there is a ==circular relationship== between particular acts and habit/virtue, between doing and becoming\n\t\t- Catholic tradition speaks of THEOLOGICAL and MORAL virtues\n\t\t\t- Theological virtues (e.g. faith, hope, charity): they \"facilitate\" ==our relationship with God==\n\t\t\t- Moral virtues (e.g. prudence, temperance, fortitude, justice): facilitate ==our relationship with others==\n\t\t\t\t- Human virtues; one need not be a believer in God to recognize their importance\n\t\t\t\t- Part of a mature responsible personality\n\t\t\t\t- Work in progress; part of the process of growing and maturing\n\t\t- Freedom is related to virtues in that ==we exercise our freedom in order to develop these virtues/good habits==\n- The **\"components\"** of a moral act. (Aside from freedom and knwoeldge, here's an added 3rd element to be able to diffrentiate between a \"grave\" and a \"minor\" human act)\n\t- **Freedom**\n\t\t- the more free I am in acting, the more responsible I am for my acts\n\t- **Knowledge**\n\t\t- the less I know, the less free I am\n\t- **(Grave) Matter**\n\t\t- Freedom and knowledge are ==subjective== elements while the gravity of the matter is ==objective.==\n\t\t- Examples of what gravity of the matter looks like:\n\t\t\t- Being attacked by a thief -\u003e seriousness of the injury\n\t\t\t- Being pressured to produce an unsafe vaccine -\u003e how many people die from it\n\t\t- Under this rubric, certain acts are objectively grave, independent of the freedom and knowledge of the person acting.\n\t\t- ==The more objectively grave an act is, the greater the justification should be.== Perhaps, in this context, we can speak of the comparability of values or the good.\n\t\t\t- Abortion in the case of ectopic pregnancy\n\t\t\t- Abortion because I cannot take care of anotehr child\n\t\t\t- Lying to one who has a right to the truth V.S. lying to one who does not have a right to the truth\n- There are other secondary considerations that can aggravate/mitigate the gravity of an act, and therefore the responsibility of the person\n\t- **CIRCUMSTANCE:** the use of superior force and treachery would aggravate; the timing may change the meaning of the act\n\t- **INTENTION of the ACTOR:** while the intention is primary to the actor, it is dangerous to place undue importance on the intention\n\t\t- After all, the road to hell is paved with good intentions\n- Conclusion\n\t- The uniqueness of the human response lies in the freedom and awareness that ==I (can!) shape myself and direct my life according to the image of God in whom I was created==\n\t- Virtues/good habits make our ==tending to the good \"easier\".==\n\t- Freedom is responsibly exercised when used to ==choose the authentic human good== (cateogrical) and when used to ==shape ourselves in the image of God in whom we were created== (transcendental)\n- Footnotes to Virtues/Values\n\t- General\n\t\t- Human goods/values/virtues perfect and complete the human person\n\t\t- By developing these values, persons move closer to the image of God in whom they were created (normative anthropology).\n\t\t- These values/virtues may not be developed perfectly; their realization is a work in progres\n\t\t- Persons are *homines viatores*, pilgrims, on the way to becoming, in the process of fuller realization, thus the importance of ==time and direction.==\n\t- Morality (the doing of the good/right) is not merely a matter of obeying the law but is related to ==the realization of values which are knowable through reason.==\n\t\t- On the basis of our experience of conscience, we asserted that we are drawn towards the good, and that we find satisfaction, joy, and fulfillment in the doing of the good. We experience this ==\"ought\" or \"moral imperative\"==\n\t\t- This ought or moral imperative is both OBJECTIVE and SUBJECTIVE\n\t\t\t- **OBJECTIVE:** because it's experienced as an imposition from the outside; one cannot change or be exempted from it, almost as though it were a physical law (e.g. gravity, sugar and dibaetes -\u003e it being wrong to kill)\n\t\t\t- **SUBJECTIVE:** because we recognize that the demands of this ought to correspond to and fulfill our inner desires welling from the depths of our hearts. The demands of this moral imperative is not something alien and external to ourselves; rather, they fulfill and satisfy the innermost longings of our hearts.\n\t\t- Thus the claim we made earlier is that ==there's connaturality (connected by nature) between man and value/good==\n\t- From VALUES to NORMS\n\t\t- The externally imposed objective norms are ==expressions of values== (e.g. laws of the land, traffic regulations, code of discipline in school, people's tranditions)\n\t\t- Norms are meant to articulate, promote, protect, and enforce these values\n\t\t- Norms, laws, and rules arise from and are based on values\n\t\t- Laws and other external codes do not stand by alone; they are based on these values\n\t\t- As we understand these values better, and ourselves and our circs better, ==it may be necessary to amend these rules to express and protect these values better.==\n\t\t\t- E.G. age of criminal liability, capital punishment, the earlier release of prisoners for good behavior, the protection of women and children, economic provisions of the Constitution, etc.\n\n#### The \"MACRO\" Approach \n- Intro\n\t- What I do doesn't remain simply on the level of the act that comes and goes. What I do, especially the acts that I do with full freedom + knowledge ==affect my \"being\",== or as we shall argue, ==affects the direction/orientation in which I'm moving.==\n\t- Insufficient to look at the acts alone; we need to go beyond the act to the ==actor== who remains, who is affected by the act, who is responsible for the act\n\t- The \"MICRO\" approach focuses on the dimensions of ==freedom and knowledge.== The macro approach adds the dimensions of ==person and time.==\n- **The Dimension of the PERSON** (Acts do not stand by themselves, existing in a vacuum)\n\t- Acts ==\"belong\"== to a person. An act is imputable to a person because he is the source of the act.\n\t- Acts ==affect== the person. \n\t\t- If he does a good deed and does it often, he forms a good habit, orienting him towards the good, solidifying his orientation towards the good, towards his better self. \n\t\t- If his act caused harm to another, he is sorry for it and would like to make reparations.\n\t- The person gives ==\"meaning\"== to the act. While acts have general meanings, the specific meaning of an act comes from ==the actor and from his \"intention\".==\n\t- He's affected by the act in another sense. A person's acts \"redound to his being\"; the acts contribute to the formation and development of habits (virtues) and ultimately to the kind of person he becomes. \n\t\t- In another context, we said these acts orient the actor to the kind of person he'll become.\n\t- The person is ultimately responsible for his acts. Before men (i.e. the law, the courts, the discipline committee, his conscience), and ultimately before God.\n\t- The person is ultimately responsible not only for his acts but for the ==kind of person he becomes.==\n\t- It's in this context that the authors also speak of the two level on which freedom is exercised: categorial and transcendental\n\t\t- The \"object\" of categorical freedom is ==particular choices==\n\t\t- The object of transcendental freedom ultimately revolves around ==God and the good==: either for God or against God, for the good, against the good.\n\t- Chronologically, particular acts are prior...through them, we eventually establish a kind of a ==fundamental orientation== towards the good (hopefully!) or towards evil. \n\t\t- Orientation towards the good makes the doing of good particular acts easier; repeated particular  acts strengthen and solidify our orientation towards the good.\n\t\t- Same applies vice versa for evil.\n- **Dimension of TIME:** \n\t- If there is a criticism we can offer to the ‚Äúsin as an act‚Äù model is that it is incomplete, and therefore an inaccurate picture of reality for these reasons.\n\t\t- Presents a static pictures; does not take into account that a person is a ==dynamic and progressive being==\n\t\t\t- Progressive: a person is not necessarily the same today as he was yesterday, or a year ago, or 15 years ago when he was an adolescent and now that he is more mature, now that he knows better, and thus more responsible. \n\t\t\t- Perhaps, the ‚Äúsame person‚Äù was acting, and yet it is not the same person and the significance of his act is different.\n\t\t- Man is in the ==process of becoming.== He is not a finished product.\n\t\t\t- This is why we are careful about the influence of others on us\n\t\t\t- Also the reason why on the one hand, we cannot give up on ourselves as well as on others. We are becoming, we have second chances and even third chances. There is no room for despair. But this also means we are capable of deteriorating.\n\t\t- Therefore, when we talk of sin, what is our area of discourse? We'd say in both ==particular acts== and in the ==fundamental orientation of the person==\n\t\t\t- There's a ==\"mutual causality\"== between particular acts and the general direction of the person. We start with particular acts, and eventually a direction is set; the direction makes the doing of those particular acts easier; and these repeated particular acts affirm and solidify the orientation.\n\t\t\t- In this sense, the serious and \"life threatening\" sin that could cut us off from God would be on the level of the ==fundamental orientation.==\n\t\t\t\t- It's a disposition we \"grow into\" slowly and gradually, to the point that we aren't aware of it\n\t\t\t\t- It's more grave because it's more difficult tog et out of, especially if we've profited from it + never caught\n\t\t\t\t- Our \"senses\" have become dulled to the guilt and inner conflict that we initially felt\n\t\t\t- That's not to say that there are no particular acts that could amount to this \"grave sin\" that could cut me off from God's love, and which could result in my \"self-destruction\"...but these do not happen often.\n\t\t\t- More often than not, these experiences are \"turning points\" that gradually dull our moral sense\n\n#### Sexual Sin \n*From the point of view of Christian anthropology + macro/micro perspectives*\n\n- **The Question of Non-Marital Sex** *(ref: Mattison, Non-Marital Sex)*\n\t- General Comments\n\t\t- Being married is obviously not the only requirement for virtuous sex; it's ==necessary but not sufficient==\n\t\t- Sex is the sort of activity that binds persons together, exclusively and over time; it also leads to children. In the language of the Christian tradition, sex is ==unitive and procreative.==\n\t\t\t- Procreation means: the spouses are open to new life, and that they're committed to raise, educate and form their child\n\t\t\t- Unitive means: through the sexual act, among other things, the spouses express and deepen their love and commitment to each other \n\t\t\t\t- (as seen in GS: the marital act expresses + perfects the love between spouses)\n\t\t\t- To be unitive is to be procreative: the best place to raise, form, and educate a child is in the context of a solid home, a secure \u0026 loving family context\n\t\t\t- To be procreative is to be unitive: children bring husband and wife closer to each other in their desire to raise, educate, and provide for the family\n\t\t- Thus, sexual relations should be done only in marriage because ==the meaning of the sex act can be realized fully only in marriage.==\n\t- Some Nuance\n\t\t- Although the claim here is that sex can only be virtuous in marriage, but not all non-marital sex are equally vicious. \n\t\t\t- E.G. sex between engaged couples v.s. casual one-night stands\n\t\t\t- There is a spectrum of virtue and vice, it is not a binary  question.\n\t\t- To say that marriage is the best place to raise children is not to say that children cannot be raised well by single parent or divorced or separated parent. But it would be ==more difficult.==\n\t\t- What may be said about this position: \n\t\t\t- it is possible to agree with the position stated here‚Äîthat the meaning of sex is only fully respected and done virtuously in a relationship that is exclusive, committed, and open to children\n\t\t\t- while that is the ultimate goal, it is possible to engage in sex for other reasons (pleasure, experiment, testing for sexual compatibility, even love but not yet certain if committed or exclusive) for the time being, and at a later point engage in sex that fulfills its meaning in an integral way. \n\t\t\t- In fact the argument continues: it is important that we do so to try out the relationship on all levels (including sex) before committing exclusively and permanently to the other person.\n\t\t- People who hold this position are in effect developing a habit of ==exercising their sexuality with incomplete meaning==‚Äîsex as an  instrument of pleasure, or even an expression of love that may be  genuine but not committed, and not exclusive, where sex means  something less, something different.\n\t\t\t- If we become what we repeatedly do, then we are orienting  ourselves towards a certain direction, we are creating a habit that may not be that easy to reverse.\n\t- 2 \"Objections\" to this position\n\t\t- **Why commitment?**\n\t\t\t- The objection is coming from understanding love as romantic feeling‚Äîthat if the feelings are gone as they inevitably will, why should I stay in the relationship? But this is not a reason for nor a solid foundation of marriage.\n\t\t\t- Marriage is a ==commitment to go through life together.==\n\t\t\t- A stable and secure family life is the best place to raise children.\n\t\t\t- ==Permanence makes possible certain facets of shared life== that  otherwise are not possible. \n\t\t\t\t- W and G say a lot about the values of permanence-you can plan over the long term, you can deepen and humanize your love for each other, you develop and complement your shared talents.\n\t\t\t- This is based on the assumption that there is something life-giving and enriching and true about doing so\n\t\t\t- As a commitment, it may feel like an obligation due to difficulties encountered, our own weaknesses, our own immaturity, even our selfishness. Marriage properly speaking is ==a source of true happiness and deep fulfillment.==\n\t\t- **But I can be committed without getting married, without that piece of paper!** (What can that piece of paper add to our love so fervent and true.‚Äù)\n\t\t\t- Via their public profession, they are proclaiming to society that this relationship is not only about themselves. ==It is something that larger society has a stake in.== It is not merely a private arrangement as BF/GF.\n\t\t\t\t- The public profession of vows adds something to the relationship, something that can be a powerful support for married couples. It is recognized to be so by society, by the state, by their religious community. The bond that they create is protected by the public weal; they cannot simply walk out of their marriage.\n\t\t\t\t\t- So yes, this \"piece of paper\" has power\n\t\t\t\t- A person who makes this claim about ‚Äúthe piece of paper‚Äù is probably afraid of its effects, or worse, he/she probably has no intention of keeping it.\n\t\t\t- As a committed relationship, marriage involves more than the momentary now. ==It remembers the past and celebrates a common future.==\n\t\t\t\t- McCormick: ==Marriage is the best way to humanize our sexuality.==  Sexual expression, to have full human meaning, to be nourishing, to avoid being trivialized, is not just about the present. As a language, it celebrates the past and guarantees the future. Sex and eros are fleeting, fickle, frustrating unless they are supported by philia and the friendship of a permanent covenant.\n\t\t\t\t- CCC: marriage helps to overcome self-absorption, egoism, pursuit of one one‚Äôs own pleasures, and to ==open oneself to the other in mutual self-giving.==\n\t\t\t\t- Ramsay: one‚Äôs capacity for responsible fidelity to the being and well-being of another makes marriage possible; man‚Äôs inclination towards selfishness and irresponsibility makes marriage (especially as a committed relationship protected by the state and society) makes marriage necessary.\n\t\t\t\t- Thus, while marriage celebrates the beauty of the human spirit and the heights to which it can soar, it is also intended to ==assist in protecting men and women from undue harm that can occur because of human frailty, selfishness, and irresponsibility.==\n- **The Question of Masturbation**\n\t- Catechism of the Catholic Church 2352:\n\t\t- Masturbation is ==an intrinsically and gravely disordered act== (nature of the act)\n\t\t- But in order to form an equitable judgement about the person‚Äôs moral responsibility (whether it is a ‚Äúsin‚Äù or nor)...\n\t\t- One must take into account ==his affective maturity, the force of acquired habit, conditions of anxiety and other psychological factors that may mitigate or aggravate moral responsibility.==\n\t- CCC 2352 makes three important statements:\n\t\t- Distinction between the ==nature of the act (objective)== and moral ==culpability (subjective/sin).==\n\t\t\t- The nature of the act is disordered (not a positive value, does not contribute to the growth/development of the person)\n\t\t\t- But it's not clear that this is always a sin (moral culpability)\n\t\t\t\t- That the person is morally responsible for the act\n\t\t\t\t- Or that the act necessarily affects his fundamental orientation\n\t\t\t\t- Or that it is a validation of an option for evil\n\t\t\t\t- Other factors need to be considered in order to form an equitable judgement as to whether it's a sin or not\n\t\t- The nature of the act is disordered, its not a positive value; it  militates against the authentic human good of the person\n\t\t- But even if the act is disordered (the nature of the act), masturbation ==does not automatically mean that it is a sin. ==\n\t\t\t- Killing is not a value but it is not always a sin. EG, accidental killing, self-defense, etc.\n\t\t\t- Sin does not consist only of a disordered act, although sin includes it.\n\t\t\t- Another factor must be included: namely, the perosn must be responsible (full knowledge and full freedom)\n\t- Why is the nature of the act disordered, it is not a value?\n\t\t- The act of masturbation can be isolating, when a person finds the ==locus of all pleasure in himself==...with the result that he cannot move on to the further stage of ==being able to share hmself with another person==, which is essential to his growth and development\n\t\t- A person may come to value and understand human sexuality more as a ==solitary experience== than a shared one\n\t\t- The full meaning of human sexuality in its best ‚Äúform‚Äù‚Äî love-giving, unitive, interpersonal. It is in this ==innate inability, incompleteness, its innate handicap to reflect and embody the richness of human  sexuality== that masturb is said to be negative, that it is not a value.\n\t\t- Masturbation can also indiciate self-centeredness, isolation, perhaps even evasion of personal responsibility. ==To exploit one‚Äôs sexuality in this manner deliberately and consistently creates a serious obstacle to personal growth.==\n\t\t- Kraft: Masturbation is particularly seductive because it is an easily accessible way to release sexual tension and explore genital pleasure and fantasies ==without personal vulnerability and investment.==\n\t\t\t- We do not have to risk rejection or failure  \n\t\t\t- Instead of engaging in a mature relationship, we can create a make-believe world where everything is possible.  \n\t\t\t- Masturbation can satisfy interpersonal yearnings (at least momentarily) while remaining an individual, safe and riskless affair.\n\t- CCC: To form an equitable judgement about a person‚Äôs moral responsibility, one must take into account other factors (not only the nature of the act). According to moral theologians, the following circumstances mitigate (lessen the gravity of) moral responsibility:\n\t\t- Masturbation could be expressive of a person's (especially an adolescent) effort ==to understand and integrate various elements of his identity as a sexual being==\n\t\t- Masturbation can also be ==symptomatic of many non-sexual conflicts== (e.g. boredom, poor self-image, frustration, loneliness)\n\t\t- Masturbation can point to ==\"unfinishedness\"==: the incomplete process of growth and development of a person.\n\t\t\t- To be unfinished (man on the way to becoming, the element of time) is not immoral or irresponsible, ==it is to be challenged to further growth. ==\n\t\t\t- But one must not choose to remain there or to prefer to be ‚Äúunfinished‚Äù.\n- **Responsible Parenthood and the Regulation of Birth**\n\t- Biological Introduction\n\t\t- Essentially, the **natural** method of contraception builds on the biological fact that the woman is not always fertile.\n\t\t\t- Natural contraception means timing the intercourse between husband and wife during the periods of natural infertility of the wife. \n\t\t\t- The difficulty associated with the natural method is  determining with greater accuracy when is the woman infertile.\n\t\t- The **artificial** methods are classified: surgical [vasectomy, ligation],  chemical [spermicide, pills], physical barriers [condom].\n\t- **Moral Evaluation**\n\t\t- **Casti connubii** [Pius X, 1932]\n\t\t\t- Augustine's view (in order to see the radicalness of the doctrine proposed in CC)\n\t\t\t\t- Concupiscent sex, that is to say, sexual intercourse that is not for procreation is sinful. It is contrary to God's design who had intended sexual intercourse for the propagation of the human race. Any use other than that ordained by God is sinful.\n\t\t\t\t- The only way to humanize the sexual act, to make it conform with the design of God the creator is by intending it for procreation.\n\t\t\t\t- If the spouses are also brought closer together in the process, and if they are able to express their love in the process, and if they are able to release their sexual tensions and experience pleasure in the process (the so-called ‚Äúsecondary‚Äù purposes of sex)- well and good but all these other purposes of the sexual act are subordinate to the primary purpose which is to procreate - and by primary, Aug means, ==procreation must be intended.==\n\t\t\t- CC contained these three statements:\n\t\t\t\t- The spouses are not forbidden to consider the secondary purposes of marriage provided t==he intrinsic nature of the act is preserved.==\n\t\t\t\t- The secondary purposes must remain subordinated to the primary purpose; that is to say, ==procreation must remain primary== (on the level of the intention of the spouses).\n\t\t\t\t- Provided, in other words, that ==the act remains open to the possibility of procreation.==\n\t\t\t- Although both Aug and CC affirm the primacy of the procreative over the unitive, that the secondary must always remain subordinate to the primary, as we have seen, CC meant something less than Aug.\n\t\t\t\t- By allowing the spouses to consider the secondary purposes [provided the intrinsic nature of the act is preserved-- meaning, they must not interpose anything in the act to prevent conception], CC meant ‚Äúby the primacy of the procreative purpose‚Äù that ==the primary purpose of procreation **should not be prevented**==\n\t\t\t\t- while ‚Äúthe primacy of the procreative purpose‚Äù in Aug means that ==the **primary purpose of procreation must be intended** by the spouses.==\n\t\t\t- Why it's a radical move\n\t\t\t\t- Since for Aug: Procreation must be intended, any form of contraception would be immoral because ==any form of contraception, natural or artificial, would have indicated a purpose and intention contrary to the design of God.==\n\t\t\t\t- On the other hand, because CC understands primacy to mean that the procreative must not be prevented, ==it was able to allow the natural method.==\n\t\t\t- In short...\n\t\t\t\t- The focus of Augustine is on ==the persons==: the persons must intend procreation.\n\t\t\t\t- On the other hand, the focus of CC is not on the person but on ==the act.== The act must be open to procreation (even if the spouses are not) by not interposing artificial means to frustrate the inherent purpose of the act and of the reproductive organs.\n\t\t- **Humanae Vitae** [Paul VI, 1967]\n\t\t\t- The doctrine proposed in Humanae Vitae 16: \n\t\t\t\t- If then there as serious motives to space out births, the church teaches that it is then licit to take into account the rhythms immanent in the generative functions for the use of marriage in the infecund periods only and in this way regulate birth without offending moral principles.\n\t\t\t- Reasons/arguments in support of this doctrine:\n\t\t\t\t- Contraception is artificial, therefore it is wrong [disvalue] and should never be freely chosen.\n\t\t\t\t\t- Artificial does not inherently mean bad, since many artificial things are good in the sense that they enable natural functions...==Artificial contraception impedes the natural functioning of the reproductive organs.==\n\t\t\t\t- The physiological argument focuses on the meaning of the sexual act.  It is understood as procreative [it transmits life].\n\t\t\t\t\t- a sexual act that is deliberately deprived of its capacity to  transmit life [e.g., by use of condoms, pills, etc.] ==violates the meaning of  the act. ==\n\t\t\t\t\t- The intention of the actors is ==not consistent with the finality of  the act== as intended by the Creator.\n\t\t\t\t- The intrinsic worth of human life argument\n\t\t\t\t\t- The argument focuses on the value of human life.\n\t\t\t\t\t- Contraceptive intercourse militates against and is hostile towards an important and fundamental human value, namely life. \n\t\t\t\t\t- Thus, the use of artificial contraception reveals ==an ‚Äúinternal disposition‚Äù against the value of life==‚Äîalmost like, you are a great poet and you don‚Äôt want to create poetry, you are a musician/lyricist and you refuse to create music.\n\t\t\t\t- The special act of creation argument\n\t\t\t\t\t- The argument is that the marital act is a privileged moment of special cooperation between man and God in the creation of new life. \n\t\t\t\t\t- When man and woman by a deliberate act frustrate the life-giving potential  such a marital act [through the use of artificial contraception] is an evidence of a will and an intention against life. ==Man turns his back to God and ‚Äúrefuses‚Äù to cooperate with God.==\n\t\t\t\t- Contraceptive intercourse violates the meaning of the act\n\t\t\t\t\t- The argument is that there is an inseparable connection between the procreative and unitive meanings/purposes of the sexual act. \n\t\t\t\t\t- This is ==willed by God== (in the laws of biology) and ==man cannot separate them on his own authority.==\n\t\t\t- Difficulties raised against the teaching of the HV\n\t\t\t\t- HV 12 asserts the inseparable connection of the unitive and procreative purposes of marriage but HV 16 allows the natural method.\n\t\t\t\t\t- Doesn't the natural method also separate the unitive and the procreative, certainly on the ==level of the intention?== It is precisely for the reason of avoiding conception that the spouses time their sexual contact during the infertile period of the wife.\n\t\t\t\t\t- Are the unitive and procreative purposes in fact inseparable?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- The woman is only fertile (that is conception is possible) only three days every 28 days; and the fertility age of the woman ends at a certain age (late forties?) \n\t\t\t\t\t\t- The causal relationship between insemination on the one hand and on the other fertilization, implantation and ultimately procreation is statistical, not necessary/inseparable. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t- No act of sexual intercourse has in itself an independent biological capacity for procreation. Otherwise, every act of of insemination would result in conception.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t- This biological capacity is dependent on many other conditions [the woman has ovulated; the sperm cells are healthy]\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- Thus, the claim that the relationship between unitive and procreative is not necessary/inseparable but ==statistical.==\n\t\t\t\t\t- Defenders of HV would respond that at least the use of the natural method leaves the ‚Äúact‚Äù open to the transmission of life - in the sense that nothing artificial is interposed to prevent the meeting of the egg and the sperm. \n\t\t\t\t\t- But the opponents of HV will say that the ‚Äúact may be open, but the husband and wife are not.‚Äù It almost becomes a game of Russian roulette.\n\t\t\t\t- The use of artificial contraception indicates an inferior kind of love\n\t\t\t\t- The general tenor of the document is that it understands the meaning of procreative only in the most minimal biological sense of the sperm fertilizing the egg.\n\t\t\t\t- The difficulty with the argument that focuses on particular acts.\n\n#### Implications for a Moral Decision\n*A summary?*\n\n- The primacy of a well-formed and a well-informed conscience  \n- The ‚Äúdecision‚Äù of conscience is personal, specific, one time; it does not legislate the rule [the use of artificial methods is ALWAYS right]\n- The relation between C/3 and the Magisterium\n\t- the 3 components?\n- HV obviously refers to the nature of the act (but to arrive at an HV obviously refers to the nature of the act (but to arrive at an equitable judgement about a person‚Äôs moral culpability, other factors must be taken into account...)\n\n---\n\n### Orals\n**Thesis:**\n- There are two components /aspects to an adequate moral evaluation: MICRO which looks at the particular acts and distinguishes between HUMAN and NON-HUMAN acts [on the basis of freedom, knowledge, matter, and circumstances]; and MACRO which looks beyond the acts and includes the actor who remains and is in the process of becoming.  \n- Masturbation is a gravely and intrinsically disordered act. But in order to an arrive at an equitable moral judgement, one must look at other factors: the individual‚Äôs affective maturity, the force of acquired habits, conditions of anxiety and other psychological and social factors that may extenuate freedom and therefore moral responsibility.\n- TL;DR: a moral evaluation of the act of masturbation\n\t- micro part\n\t- macro part\n\t- circumstances? situations? that can mitigate moral responsibility\n\n**Outline:**\n- Intro: a moral evaluation of the act of masturbation\n- Part 1: Components to an adequate moral evaluation (add examples of masturbation?)\n\t- MICRO Part: what we do\n\t\t- Components of a moral act\n\t\t\t- Knowledge\n\t\t\t\t- definition: consciousness, awareness of your act\n\t\t\t\t- the less I know, the less free I am, and vice versa\n\t\t\t- Freedom \n\t\t\t\t- definition: the ability and responsibility¬†to direct our lives in accordance with¬†our meaning and purpose (according to God's will)\n\t\t\t\t- exercised on 2 levels:\n\t\t\t\t\t- categorical: doing good and avoiding evil \n\t\t\t\t\t- transcendental: becoming conformed to the image of God in whom I was created \n\t\t\t\t- the more free I am in acting, the more responsible I am for my acts, and vice versa\n\t\t\t\t- How is freedom is related to virtues?\n\t\t\t\t\t- Virtues are good stable habits; they're developed from particular acts being repeated over time\n\t\t\t\t\t- We exercise our freedom in order to develop these virtues/good habits\n\t\t\t\t\t- Virtues make doing good easier\n\t\t\t- Matter\n\t\t\t\t- Objective\n\t\t\t\t- The gravity of an act: How much has it affected people?

And the elder answered, From the ancestors, from the land, from the time of creation.\" This piece of dialogue best encapsulates my appreciation of the film because it showed me the motivation behind the Ati tribe advocating for their rights; it's because they're humble enough to admit that their ancestral lands and cultural heritage are the foundations of their knowledge. Thus, they work in protecting these in their own ways:  legally fighting for their land rights, teaching Ati children in school, upholding local traditions. However, the tribe is seen as the [Other](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Other_(philosophy)#Imperialism_and_colonialism) by their fellow citizens and government: they get made fun for their looks, they're considered unsightly for tourists, and they're seen as difficult to hire (because of factors like lacking social skills, inadequate education). Even if there've been some outside efforts that have helped the tribe, like [President Duterte distiributing a portion of Boracay to them](https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/11/08/18/duterte-distributes-land-to-ati-tribe-in-boracay), I can't help but feel that it's all optics; if the President truly cared about their rights, why does this not apply to other IPs like the Lumads? Thankfully, this film is different. Even if the director is also an outsider (being Illongo), he spotlighted many voices, from the marginalized tribe members to their gracious supporters. He recognized that he had a lot to learn from them (instead of the other way around), saying: [\"We will always be humbled by the experience this Ati village in Boracay gave us.\"](https://www.facebook.com/1935087663246115/posts/direk-kevin-piamonte-visits-the-ati-village-in-boracay-as-part-of-his-christmas-/2733024816785725/) I think we, the audience, can also be humbled by this film because many of us take our surroundings for granted. What if we treated nature and culture as treasured gifts, instead of things we can simply consume for our own benefit?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the film *Filipinos Retreat from Trenches* (1899), the gesture that best encapsulated my appreciation of it was Filipino soldiers making their last stand in the pits. This moment struck me because of how hopeful it seemed in the midst of dark times; despite knowing that they were essentially walking into a suicide mission ([since the Americans had an insurmountable military advantage over them](https://www.thoughtco.com/philippine-american-war-4846100)), they wholeheartedly committed to it. This can be seen in their wearing of white uniforms that \ncontrast with their dark surroundings, along with defending their territory with \"great stubbornness\", as the film's description states. This film has a depressing ending that reflects a depressing reality: we are still victims of imperialism, and our conquerors get to define history (this can be seen in how this film was produced by an American company, and [how so many Filipinos grow up glorifying the West](https://www.reddit.com/r/Filipino/comments/hvi5lc/why_do_filipino_worship_whitewestern_culture_so/)). I believe this film also shows \"[Filipino resilience](https://www.scmp.com/yp/report/latest-reports/article/3123941/opinion-resilience-natural-characteristic-philippines-or)\": how Filipinos can consantly pick themselves up in times of disaster.  I personally don't like how glorified this trait is because it exempts higher powers from taking  accountability (i.e. our government, imperialist countries), but I also see how many people can draw inspiration from it. If we were able to get through centuries of colonization, perhaps we can make it through the dismal future that lies ahead of us, like a looming recession and a oligarch-controlled government.\n\n\n![[Pasted image 20220621215149.png]]\n\n\n### Task 2\n-   With the films in this module as pretext, think about how they relate to the concept of¬†**imagination**¬†(whether collective or individual).\n-   Drawing from your background or experience, if you have any related or tangential insights, please feel free to share as well.\n\n\nHow do both of these films relate to the concept of imagination? Despite their differences, they're both about Filipinos fighting for a dream future ‚Äî one where they are truly free. This is a future they have to imagine because they haven't experienced freedom in so long, thanks to decades of foreign powers taking over what they truly own. Even if they don't know what it's like to be free, they still know that it's their right. This is what motivates them to make their imagination a reality. \n\nRelated to this insight, I realized recently that my dream future is collective liberation: a radical future that's free of oppressive systems, and everyone gets to be treated with dignity and respect. This got me way more interested in critical theory! I'm quite the polymath, so I'm motivated to work towards this future in various ways, whether it's as an educator or a technologist.\n\n![[Pasted image 20220622001519.png]]\n![[Pasted image 20220622001538.png]]","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T15:56:56.99613631Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2022-06-22":{"title":"2022-06-22","content":"## Filipino Film and Society\n#society #Filipino #culture #media \n- **epistemic violence:** how knowledge is created, circulated....\n\t- Why do they need to go to a school?

This was accelerated by the pandemic, which forced everyone to collaborate online; despite all the benefits of remote work, [people missed each other](https://news.microsoft.com/innovation-stories/mesh-for-microsoft-teams/): remote meetings are impersonal, lacking the small real-life moments that colleagues cherished. Through mixed reality applications, Mesh brings this desired presence back into the virtual space.\n\nIf this device was successfully and widely adopted, it could help creates a future where we fully live in the [Metaverse](https://www.gather.town/post/why-the-metaverse-matters). Before, our locations would dictate our lives: work, education, love, etc. Now, we spend most of our lives on the Internet, interacting with users all over the globe. Imagine how much our online experiences could be transformed by presence. The Metaverse would create not only meaningful human connection, but also unprecedented access to opportunity. \n\nFor instance, McKinsey states that [industries with the highest physical proximity are likely to be most disrupted](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/future-of-work/the-future-of-work-after-covid-19): healthcare, retail, education, etc. Opportunity would become more accessible for both customers and employees; the former could acquire world-renowned expertise while the latter could work abroad ‚Äî all without leaving their homes. This would especially benefit those from developing countries, like the Philippines. For example, the web3 space is full of infinite learning opportunities, like attending workshops and contributing to projects. However, I struggle to make the most out of these because the space is very Eurocentric. It's difficult to network and collaborate with others because of my timezone and passport; even worse, the way I present myself online is limited to my avatar or video. Mesh would help me fully connect with others by making me more \"real\" to them.\n\nHowever, despite all the benefits Mesh has to offer, I also worry that it could bring about a dystopian Metaverse: one that dehumanizes its users. Across various VR platforms, there've already been many incidents of degrading behavior, such as [racist insults](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/20/cto-racism-could-ruin-metaverse-if-tech-doesnt-improve-diversity-now.html) and [sexual harassment](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/12/16/1042516/the-metaverse-has-a-groping-problem/). Mesh's features can be unintentionally used for these nefarious purposes. A dystopian world  is also oppressive, surveilling their citizens through [corporate and technological control](https://libraryguides.mdc.edu/c.php?g=957851\u0026p=6914808). A [monopolized Metaverse](https://reboothq.substack.com/p/metaverse) can exemplify this; Anthony Tan describes this as \"...a privatized, financially maximizing reality...where humans...are harvested for data, status, and money.\" Mesh users would not only be giving Microsoft ‚Äî a Big Tech corporation ‚Äî money, but also all their behavioral data. How else can the device generate a lifelike photorealistic projection? And how can we be sure that this device won't record our experience while using it? Microsoft would end up upholding what Shoshana Zuboff calls [surveillance capitalism](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/24/opinion/sunday/surveillance-capitalism.html): a business model that endangers our privacy and democracy.\n\nOverall, Mesh can only be ready for adoption if it is heavily evaluated by experts; otherwise, instead of circumventing inequalities, it would elevate them.\n\n\nThe Internet helped us expand beyond our local networks, connecting us with people all over the world; the Metaverse could build on this by enabling us to deeply engage with others, no matter the distance. \n\nThe lack of resources pushes Filipinos to study/work overseas, a costly process only a few can afford. \n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/future-of-work/the-future-of-work-after-covid-19\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T15:56:56.99613631Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2022-06-27":{"title":"2022-06-27","content":"## Cultural Studies of Technology\n#technology #culturalstudies \n### Critical Theory and Cultural Studies\n#### Theory VS Law\n- A **law** is a more solidifed and formal statement, distilled and arrived at from repeated experiemnts\n- **Theories** are not laws because they have not been verified to the same degree, and may not be sufficiently general; theories may lead to the formulation of laws in the long run, eventually\n\n#### Marxist Theory\n- **Base:** a combination of the 'forces of production' and the 'relations of production'.\n\t- ==Forces of production:== raw materials, tools, tehcnology, workers, and their skills, etc.\n\t- ==The relations of production:== class relations of those engaged in production.\n\t- Each mode of production produces its own particular relations of production. One's class positon is determined by one's relationship to the mode of production.\n\t\t- E.G. capitalist mode: bourgeois/proletariat relations\n- **Superstructure:** ==institutions== (political, legal, educational, cultural, etc.) and =='definite forms of social consciousness'== generalized by these which arise on the basis of the mode of production (economic base)\n- Systems of infrastructure\n\n#### Ideology and Mass Media\n- In Marxism, an **ideology** is a ==false set of ideas perpetuated by the dominant political class==\n- According to this stance, the mass media functions to produce =='false consciousness'==\n- This leads to an ==extreme stance== whereby media products are seen aas to be monolithic expressions of ruling class values\n\n#### Marxist Keywords and Concepts\n- socio-economic approach\n- emphasis on class struggle\n- ideology and 'false consciousness'\n\n#### Marxism and Conflict Theory\n*from the video recommendations*\n\n- Marx is concerned with ==freedom==. He asked: \"How can people be free?\" Because humans aren't naturally free; we're actually very constrained.\n- **Labor:** the work we put in to survive in our world (by changing it)\n\t- We must labor cooperatively in order to survive\n- We may have freed ourselves from natural constraints (i.e. physical bodies), we entangled ourselves in new ==social constraints== (i.e. inequal power structures)\n- Thus, Marxism is concerned with labor: how it's organized, who benefits, how it changes over time\n- **Historical Materialism:** looks at ==change over time== + concerned w/ questions of ==material reality==: production and control of resources\n\t- In order to understand things like politics and religion, you need to understand that material reality they were based on first\n- Base and superstructure\n- Marx saw historical development in terms of ==modes of production== and ==economic classes==\n\t- modes of production: stags of history\n- **Industrial capitalism**\n\t- working class (proletariat) v.s. capitalists (bourgeoise)\n\t- difference in control over means of production -\u003e exploitation in capitalism in the form of ==wage labor==\n\t- difference between value of wage \u0026 value of what's produced -\u003e source of ==surplus== in capitalism\n\t- 1 big problem: crises...specifically, ==crises of production==...for the first itme in history, there are crises of having too much\n\t\t- advances always stall, because forces of production will always run up against the limits created by the relations of production\n\t\t\t- limiting factories, technology, human labor\n\t\t- capitalists drove down wages in pursuit of profit, and they competed with each other, leading to a lack of coordination in the economy\n\t\t\t- Wound up with a population that couldn't afford to buy anything, but at the same time were offered more goods than they could ever need\n\t\t- In short: ==relations of production that created economic growth became precisely the things that causes crises==\n- How can society move past this impasse? According to Marx, the way forward was ==class conflict==\n\t- history is a matter of struggling classes, he said, each aligned with either the forces (proletariat) or relations of production (bourgeois)\n\t- bourgeois like the status quo (because profit), while the proletariat want change... a ==revolution==\n\t\t- further development in forces of production; complete change in relations of production\n\t\t- end to exploitation, they want the surplus to benefit them, since their labor created the surplus...\n- How do the bourgeoise manage to stay in power so effectively? According to Gramsci, it's through ==hegemonic culture or hegemony==: a dominant set of ideas that are all-pervasive and taken for granted in society\n\t- don't need to be economic ideas; can also be beliefs about gender or race\n- Marx's biggest impact -\u003e even though it's specific to economic conflict, we can see it in the essence of the broader sociological paradigm of ==conflict theory==: the basic idea of looking at power dynamics and analyzing the ways in which struggles over power drive social change\n\t- as all kinds of groups, not just workers and owners, fight for control over resources\n- Marx's ideas gave rise to tons of conflict theories in sociology. These theories give us ways to understand power, control, and freedom in society\n\t- Race-Conflict Theory\n\t- Gender-Conflict Theory\n\t- Intersectional Theory\n\n#### Structuralism\n##### Semiotics\n- Words make the world intelligible by differentiating between concepts\n- Language is what creates differentation\n\t- E.G. 'baka' in English and Japanese\n- Comes with...\n\t- Signifier\n\t- Signified\n\t- Sign\n\t- Code\n\n![[Pasted image 20220627142950.png]]\n\n- Basic premise: all forms of communication can be broken down into ==individual units of meaning,== which may then be studied in terms of their singular characteristics\n- Units of meaning are understood in terms of how they interact with other units of meaning\n\n###### Semiotics and Structuralism\n- Structuralism stresses that ==each element within a cultural system derives it meaning from its relationship to every other element==\n- There are no independent meanings, but rather many meanings produced by their difference from other elements in the system\n\n##### Keywords/Summary\n**Signs**\n\nSigns are said to be formed by the¬†**signifier**¬†and the¬†**signified**. The signifier, in general, is what we perceive and experience, while the signified is the meaning the the signifier pertains to. In this arrangement, the signifier¬†_points to_¬†the signified. It must be noted, additionally, that we make sense of the world through the use of signs, and that signs get their meaning through differentiation with other signs in the same system. In this way, we also say that the relationship between sign and meaning is arbitrary rather than fixed, given, or immutable.\n\n**Code**\nCodes refer to conventions that govern sign systems, which may range from the very strict and precise to the informal and vague.\n\n**Myth**\n\nRoland Barthes introduces the idea of mythologies or myth-making, which he describes beginning with¬†**denotation**¬†and¬†**connotation**.\n\nDenotation refers to¬†primary signification¬†or¬†_surface meaning_. Connotation, meanwhile, refers to¬†secondary signification. Barthes argues that it is at the level of secondary signification that myth is made for consumption. More importantly, mythology deals with the production of¬†**ideology**, wherein it is understood as a body of ideas and practices which defend the prevailing structure of power by actively promoting the values and interests of dominant groups in society.\n\nThis makes way to give historical intention a natural justification.\n\n#### Codes\n- Conventions (rules) governing sign systems\n- May be precise, such as grammatical rules that govern language or vague/changeable, delimited by history and context\n- Link signs together in ways that reflect a particular interpretation of a community's system of values, myths, and ideologies\n\n#### Myths\n##### Ronald Barthes: Mythologies\n- adds: denotation and conotation\n- at the level of secondary signification or conotation, myth is made for consumption\n\n##### General\n- mythic signs reinforce dominant values\n- ideological signs enlist support for the status quo by transforming history into nature; pretending the current conditions are, and always have been, the natural order of things\n- deals with the production of ideology\n- **\"Ideology\"** is understood as a ==body of ideas and practices which defend the prevailing structure of power== by actively promoting the values/interest of dominant groups in society\n- gives historical intention\n\n\n#### Critical Theory\n- An **ethically heightened** and **politically reflective** study of the relationships between **power, knowledge,** and **discourse** that are produced in contexts of **historical** and **cultural struggle.**\n\t- takes inspiration from Marxism and structuralism\n- All thought is fundamentally mediated by power relations that are socially/historically constituted\n- The relation between concept and object between signifier and signified is never stable or fixed and is oftern mediated by social relations of capitalist production and consumption\n- Scrutinizes the role of cultural institutions in the production of ideological discourse\n\n#### ISA and Hegemony\n- ISA: Ideological state appratuses\n- \"[C]ultural members ==make choices in the context of a life-world whose options for meaning have always already been shaped by ideology.== They experience themselves as exercising agency in making choices and sometimes even as resisting cultural authority.\"\n- \"They are not aware, however, of the ==options that have been rendered literally unthinkable by dominant ideologies== ‚Äî moved beyond the rim of the conceivable or legitimate.\"\n\n#### Towards Critical Theory\n- **Marxist:** ==socio-economic approach== (base/superstructure, class struggle, ideology)\n- **Semiotics:** ==structural approach== (the study of signs, codes, and the production of myths)\n- **Critical theory:** concerned with the ==production of ideology== (knowledge, power, and discourse, within the context of struggle)\n\n#### Postmodern Critical Theory\n- Disintegration of colonial systems\n- Advent of the information age\n- Globalization\n- Dismantling/reassembling of cultures\n- Loss of faith in \"foundational\" metanarratives\n- Instability of identities\n\n#### Cultural Studies\n- **Cultural economy:** the blending of the traditional meanings of text and commodity\n- Exploring the relationship between an ==object's *official* value== and its ==unofficial potential for generating meaning and supporting beliefs==\n- Culture is seen as the ==site of struggle==\n- Power/knowledge are discursively produced\n\n[**AlphaGo Documentary**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXuK6gekU1Y)\n[**Karl Marx and Conflict Theory**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR3igiwaeyc)\n\n\u003e Grounded in what we have learned from Marxist theory, we reiterate the idea that digital technology functions as a¬†system of infrastructure¬†that contributes to the economic base. In this way, it makes possible the becoming of new forms of organization, relationships, and experiences. What this means for our project of examining culture and technology, practically, is that ==any valuation of cultural production must be reconciled with the currently existing material reality it is emerging from.== In other words, any worthwhile investigation of the creation and consumption of content, the use and deployment of technologies, and more importantly their impact on societal beliefs and values, must all be ==contextualized as part of the web spun by economic activity and its resultant power structures.==\n\n\n[**Noah Chomsky - The 5 Filters of the Mass Media Machine**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34LGPIXvU5M)\n- How is consent manufactured according to what you have just watched?\n- What argument does it make with regards to the concept of \"press freedom\" in what is believed to be a democratic society?\n- In what way does the production of goods and the production of content interact with one another to realize the prevailing status quo?\n\n[**Ms. Male Character - Tropes vs Women in Video Games**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYqYLfm1rWA)\n- What signs communicate ideas such as female, femininity, of girlhood? \n- How do these differ from signs that communicate the male gender?

What have people said about this film?\n-   What do we think of the film? How has it affected us?\n\nOne piece of dialogue that best encapsulates my appreciation of Anak Dalita (1956) is \"What we shall test is your resolve amidst our poverty.\" This is because I see it as a reflection of Filipino resilience: the strength that keeps us going in times of distress. This can be seen in so much aspects of the film, like its narratives and conditions. \n\nFirst, the characters. The protagonists featured here are Vic, a disabled veteran who sculpts, and Tita, a prostitute caring for her brother. Both of them were social outcasts struggling with money, which forced them to work in unfavorable conditions, like smuggling money and dancing in clubs. But they stayed strong for the sake of love, whether it be for their family or for each other. Love has always been a driving motivator for Filipinos, especially because of a culture that values close ties so much. Next, the environment. Both of these characters were trying to survive in the slums of a materialistic post-war Manila. It could be also said that the film's workers were doing the same thing; working in the post-war Filipino industry (still reeling from the effects of Japan's occupation and the Cold War), they were trying to make the most out of considerable budgetary limitations. It seemed like everyone had to be resilient for this film, from the characters to the film workers. \n\nPerhaps this was an intentional choice of director Lamberto Avellana, whose style is realism. This was atypical of Filipino films at the same time. Unlike most directors, Avellana didn't resort to major box-office names and singing/dancing performances. Instead, he'd go all-in on realism: casting minor box-office actors, choosing poverty and crime a sa theme, filming in people's houses, etc. This stark deviation from the norm is probably what led the movie to fail in the box office. However, it got critical acclaim: it was chosen as the Philippine entry in the Oscars, and won the Golden Harvest for Best Film Award at the Asia-Pacific Film Festival. So maybe resilience does pay off in the end.\n\nWhat's my personal take? To be honest, I'm iffy with Filipino resilience because it has a problematic nature ‚Äî it takes accountability away from our government, the main entity responsible for taking care of its citizens in times of distress. It also dehumanizes the victims of these situations. However, I didn't feel disgusted watching Anak Dalita, even if it can technically be considered \"poverty porn\". It ended up touching me instead. I think it was because the film allowed me to really get to know the characters. I could empathize with them because they felt so real to me ‚Äî to the point that they felt like real human beings. If they could push through their ordeals, then maybe I could too. This kind of connection is the magic of film at work.\n\n\n\n\nOne piece of dialogue that best encapsulates my appreciation of Jaclyn Jose's performance was this line from her interview: \"Pero pinakatumatak siya sa kanyang signature acting: ang underacting, o yung parang bang, hindi umaarte.\" She brought this style to all her roles, but this can especially be seen in her role as Ma' Rosa: a mother and sari-sari owner who has to sell illegal drugs to make ends meet. In the film, she gets arrested by the police, and her children have to bail her out. I'm sure that there are many  poverty-stricken Filipinos who can relate to this experience (committing crimes just to survive), especially in an administration infamous for its anti-drug agenda and EJKs. Director Brillante Mendoza would often portray urban poor experiences like this, like joining a syndicate or taking care of adopted children. His films would often be win local and international awards, such as Cannes. I think his films are always critically acclaimed because of how...natural they are. He's able to not only reflect the harsh reality of many Filipino lives; he's also able to tell stories that universally resonate, as seen with Jaclyn Jose's natural portrayal of Ma'Rosa, a mother who'd do anything for her kids. Personally, what I take away from all of this is that we are our most successful when we're truly authentic. Connection is only possible when we're fully ourselves. \n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamberto_V._Avellana\nhttps://www.philstar.com/business/2015/12/29/1537407/through-young-eyes-philippines-and-east-asia-1956\n\n\n\n### Connect\n-   With the films in this module as pretext, think about how they relate to the concept of¬†**place**.\n-   Drawing from your background or experience, if you have any related or tangential insights, please feel free to share as well.\n\nHow do both of these films relate to the concept of place? They're both situated in the slums of Manila, and centered around people who live there. They all have to resort to dirty work (e.g. prostitution, money laundering, selling drugs) just so they remain financially capable of staying there. They're willing to put in so much effort for these poverty-stricken places because it's their only home. Despite their low status, these \"...slum inhabitants are crucial to the production of the city space, even as they are rendered invisible by those who own and control the formal means of producing space\" (Macapagal, 2021). The developed cities many of us live in wouldn't be where they are today without the invisible labor of the poor. They are our family caretakers, sari-sari store owners, construction workers, and more. But we often take them for granted because we've gotten so used to their presence, to the point that they're hidden to us. That's why I appreciate slum chronotype films like Anak Dalita and Ma'Rosa; they humanize the marginalized by spotlighting their stories, helping us empathize with them.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T15:56:56.99613631Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2022-07-01":{"title":"2022-07-01","content":"## Cultural Studies of Technology\n#technology #culturalstudies \n### Identities in Cyberculture\n#### Identity Crisis \n- **Old notion of identity:**\n\t- unified\n\t- stable\n\t- centered\n\t- an essential self\n- E.G. middle-class, Asian, heterosexual, male\n- **Postmodern notion of identity:** \n\t- Process, multiplicity, construction\n\t- Made, mobile, multiplex\n- **Contemporary phenomena:**\n\t- Globalization, disembedding, detraditionalization\n- E.g. class mobility, migrants, digital identities\n\n#### Body/Identity and Cyberculture\n- contradicting schools of thought\n- either \"we type ourselves into being in cyberspace,\" thus allowing us to \"remake who we are endlessly, liberated from the 'meat' of our RL bodies and [its] identity-markers[.]\n- Or, \"it restates difference...as it feshitizes it[.]\"\n\n#### Axes of Identity in Focus\n- Race\n- Gender\n- Sexuality\n- Class\n\n##### Race in Cyberculture\n- The assumption of a homogenous, unified set of characteristics and experiences\n- Does race matter in cyberspace?

In giving rise to existence, temporalization worlds a world. Gayatri Spivak introduced the term to postcolonial theory as shorthand to describe how European imperialist cultural representations constructed the geography of colonies. These processes of imperialist discursive cartography, which include canonical literature, are ==a form of epistemic violence that shapes how colonized subjects see themselves.== These processes continue to play a role in the \"worlding\" of the Third World and its native inhabitatns after decolonization.\n\u003e \n\u003e - Pheng Cheah\n\n\u003e ==Cartography reduces the world to a spatial object.== In contradisctinction, worlding is a force that subtends and exceeds all human calculations that reduce the world as a temporal structure ot the sum of objects in space. Imperialist cartography is ==a calculation in the sphere of geopolitical economy== that objectifies the world as a temporal process...Processes of discursive construction are worldings in a derived sense. They imbue the objective world with value and significance. But they are also processes of unworlding because by reducing the world to something spatial, they obscure it worldliness.\n\u003e \n\u003e - Pheng Cheah\n\n\u003e In seeking spatial justice in these visual narratives, ==emancipatory potentials can be gleaned from strategies that attempt to reveal and/or suppress modes of domination and repression== through their use of space in the time of narrative unfolding. From the perspective of this socio-spatial dialectic, slum films can be more productively evaluated in terms of the ways they are able to use space towards instances of emancipatory politics.\n\u003e \n\u003e - Katrina Macapagal\n\n\u003e Even if the ideological closure of the film narratives may at first glance be taken to mean the absolute absence of hope, this does not mean the films do not reveal moments where the ==social agents enact desires toward justice== configured by the slum chronotype.\n\u003e \n\u003e - Katrina Macapagal","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T15:56:56.99613631Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2022-07-05":{"title":"2022-07-05","content":"## Filipino Film and Society\n\u003e \"The cinematic organization of attention yields a situation in which attention, in all forms imaginable and yet to be imagined (from assembly-line work to spectatorship to internet-working and beyond), is that necessary cybernetic relation to the *socius*‚Äîthe totality of the social‚Äîfor the production of value of for late capital\"\n\nReading this line reminded me of one of my favorite books, *How to Do Nothing*, which is what first introduced me to the attention economy. Learning of this concept made me realize how intentional I should be with my consumption. In this hyperdigital world full of distractions, attention is a scarce resource; I want to pay attention to people that matter to me (e.g. close relationships), not corporations who want to profit from my engagement.\n\n### Observe\n\n![[Pasted image 20220705150803.png]]\n![[Pasted image 20220705150858.png]]\n\n\nThese are the two moments that stood out to me in both of these films. The first shot from *Temptation Island (1980)* depicts the beauty pageant finalists dancing after acknowledging their dire circumstances (i.e. stranded in an island with no food, water, and shelter). The second shot from *Marcos Fiesta 2013 Flash Mob Full (2013)* depicts a rave-like celebration, with actors representing the Marcoses watching on-stage. I find them both similar in the sense that performance is used to distract from reality's problems, whether it be the danger of dying or historical revisionism.\n\n### Reflect\n#### Temptation Island\n_\"What are bitches for but to bitch around with her fellow bitches?\"_\n\nCampy. Sensual. Funny. These are all the traits that define director Joey Gosiengfao's films. His masterpiece, *Temptation Island (1980)*, exemplifies all of these, and they can be best seen in this single line. Centered around four catty beauty pageant finalists, the whole film can essentially be summarized as \"bitches bitching with fellow bitches\", and I had good fun watching it all. Hair-pulling catfights, evident queerness, unexpected cannibalism ‚Äî it's impressive how Gosiengfao was able to pack all of these into one film. He truly was ahead of his time.\n\nSeriously, he was. I almost can't believe that this film was made in the 70s, during Marcos Sr.'s regime. This time was known as the Second Golden Age of Philippine Cinema; even if Martial Law brought about censorship and regulation, a generation of avant-garde filmmakers came into the spotlight, making films that presented the state of the human condition, and the ills of Filipino society (CNN Philippines Life Staff, 2016). These dark circumstances were probably a factor in why Gosiengfao never gained an award for his work. Getting recognized in the film industry requires playing with compromise and politics; winners required righteousness and respectability, everything Gosiengfao's films were not (Vera, 2007). \n\nBut I believe his controversial style of filmmaking enabled him to be truly authentic.  Beneath all its spectacle, Temptation Island (1980) was able to comment on \nAngel Britanico (2011) writes: \"Despite maintaining a front of comedy and shallowness,¬†Gosiengfiao‚Äôs material¬†dips¬†into the best and worst aspects of human nature, probing what makes people savage and what makes them human.\" This multi-layered nature is what makes his films cult classics, resonating with viewers even decades from now. I believe his spirit still lives on, as seen in the popularity of teleseryes and Drag Race. Why do we still like seeing \"bitching\"? Perhaps because it reveals so much about ourselves.\n\n\n#### Marcos Fiesta\n![[Pasted image 20220705152537.png]]\n\n\n\nWhat struck me most from this film was seeing these two actors happily dance together. On first glance, this looks like a vintage depiction of a wholesome romance. However, it gets dark when you realize that these two actors are portraying Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos ‚Äî the conjugal dictators who ruled the Philippines in 1970s. This performance was part of the Marcos Fiesta, an annual celebration held by the Ilocos Norte LGU to commemorate Ferdinand Marcos Sr.'s legacy. Performers would do balletic dances and melodramatic theatrics based on the lives of the Marcoses, encouraged by a giant flashmob wearing Marcos shirts. This extravagant fiesta is a prime example of how the Marcoses weaponize culture. Through years of investing in art, architecture, literature, and media (e.g. Malakas and Maganda paintings, \"Golden Age\" infrastructure, BBM's family vlogs), they aimed to rewrite their narrative. They not only portrayed themselves as a good-looking, aspirational, national family, but also as \"origins\" of a \"New Society\", which apparently \"...[allowed] them to cross and redraw all boundaries, social, political, and cultural.\" (Buluan, 2021; van Wagtendonk. 2022). \n\nHow exactly did the Marcoses' works sway the public? Angel Martinez (2022) explored this by exposing a new Tiktok account to a pro-BBM algorithm; I believe the following traits can apply to their other works as well, especially the Marcos Fiesta. First, the family makes use of an \"aww\" factor. They deal with negative press by painting themselves as the victim/underdog (e.g. BBM against mainstream media, Marcos Jr. being \"unfairly\" jailed). Next, they take advantage of the power of fandom. They try to humanize themselves through \"relatable\" portrayals so that the masses can empathize with them (even if they're different social classes). Then, they appeal to emotion. Instead of using complicated infographics and jargon-filled speeches, the Marcoses fight with stories: breaking hearts by talking about living without a father, bringing up nostalgia by recounting the \"Golden Age\", and sparking hope by saying \"We'll make this country great again\" (sounds familiar?). Finally, they have trusted seals of approval. The Marcoses were able to get this far thanks to the combined power of their supporters, from disinformation leaders like celebrities and private advertising agencies to fellow oligarchs such as the Dutertes. By weaponizing culture, the Marcoses were able to put the Filipinos under an \"era of thought control\", both then and now (Mijares, 1976).\n\nSeeing Marcos apologists on all kinds of social media is infuriating, but I also can't help but feel sorry for them. Many of these supporters didn't have enough critical thinking skills or technical literacy to protect themselves from the Marcoses' all-consuming narratives. We, the opposition, have a lot to learn about how this family operates. If we want to still put up a fight for these next 6 years, we need to play the long game, just like our opponents did.\n\n\n### Connect\n- cinematic mode of production\n\t- composed of forces: technology\n\t- and relations: cast and crew\n\t- cinema is the paradigmatic example of how the act of looking has been construed by capital as ‚Äúproductive labor.‚Äù\n\n\nHow are both of these films related to the concept of power? I can't help but think like a Marxist, seeing how much power struggles have influenced their making. For me, these two films both respond to authority ‚Äî the Marcos family ‚Äî in opposite ways: *Temptation Island (1980)* tries to fight against their power, while *Marcos Fiesta (2013)* attempts to sustain it. The films' forces of production are similar; materials, workers, and technology (i.e. props/VFX, actors, cinema) come together to create a visual spectacle. However, their relations of production are vastly different; Gosiengfao and his crew could be considered as part of the proletariat of his time (the director was often snubbed for awards, and many of his actors were just starting out in the scene), while the Marcoses are the epitome of the bourgeois. Overall, both films succeed in extracting the attention of their audience, which enable these films to influence their consciousness. You can either end up pondering on current society or romanticizing a new narrative; this is the power of cinema at work.\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T15:56:56.99613631Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2022-07-06":{"title":"2022-07-06","content":"## Filipino Film and Society\n#culturalstudies #media #society \n### Agency \n#### Marxism\n\u003e Men make their own history, but they do not make it as they please; they do not make it under self-selected circumstances, but ==under circumstances existing already==, given and transmitted from the past.

Thus Luther put on the mask of the Apostle Paul, the Revolution of 1789-1814 draped itself alternately in the guise of the Roman Republic and the Roman Empire, and the Revolution of 1848 knew nothing better to do than to ==parody==, now 1789, now the revolutionary tradition of 1793-95. In like manner, the beginner who has learned a new language always translates it back into his mother tongue, but he assimilates the spirit of the new language and express himself freely in it only when he moves in it without recalling the old...\n\u003e \n\u003e -- Karl Marx\n\n- enacting social change is like learning a new language\n- there's a learning curve, it takes some time before you think in this new world order\n\n#### Three Concepts of Agency\n1. **Private:** Perry Anderson suggests that we can distinguish three ways in which human beings can be said to 'make history', each involving a different sort of goal for their activity. The first and most typical form of historical action is the pursuit of 'private' goals -- =='cultivation of a plot, choice of a marriage, exercise of a skill, maintenance of a home, bestowal of a name'.==\n2. **Public:** The 2nd kind of agency, like the 1st, operates within the framework of existing social relations, pertaining to the kind of ventures involving 'public' goals, for example, =='political struggles, military conflicts, diplomatric transactions, commercial exlorations'==, that are the stuff of conventional narrative history.\n3. **Global collective:** Finally, there is the 'unprecedented form of agency' involved in the collective pursuit of global social transformation, which first appeared in the American and French Revolutions but acquired full expression only with the emergence of the workers' movement and revolutionary Marxism: here, 'for the first time cllective projects of social transformation were ==married to systematic efforts to understand the processes of past and present, to produce a premediated future.=='\n\n#### On Mode of Production\n\u003e The ==specific economic form, in which unpaid surplus-labour is pumped out of direct producers==, determines the relationship of rulers and ruled, as it grows directly out of production itself and, in turn, reacts upon it as a determining element.

She finds whimsical in dire situations. While the late Lino Brocka, and his successors, would've made grave drama about the living conditions of Tondo, Garcia-Molina finds gems of human ingenuity. The rooftop of a squalid apartment becomes filled with colorful tents and bright umbrellas that shield gamblers and afternoon drunkards from the gaze of the sun; two buildings are connected by a string that allows laundry to be brought to and fro; women drag their children like a hen dragging her set of chicks. It is that unexplainable cosmos of survivors and their survival techniques that the Americans (in this case, Will) would never understand; and that's what Garcia-Molina forwards so wonderfully.\n\t\t- That run-of-the-mill ending of all romantic comedies wherein the male lover chases after his female lover (or vice versa) which is always against time, circumstance, or calamity is pumped up by Garcia-Molina and her team of imaginative writers, made distinctly Filipino by an adherence to exaggeration and over-the-top histrionics. This time, it works mostly because Garcia-Molina has consistently made it work ever since the first scene where time-tied Sally hilariously un-knots a traffic jam to the real, from ridiculous and enjoyable party-poverty in Tondo to the half-buried yet still habitable houses of Pampanga. It's a string of fascinating sequences and all of them are genuinely enjoyable. I do not kid.\n\t\t- \"I am directing because I want to tell stories. And who are the stories for?

Broken, oo. Pero hindi missing.\"\n\nIn this scene, Will tries to excuse his behavior towards Sam, believing that he lacks a heart because of abandonment issues. Sam tells him otherwise, and berates him for not even trying to care (whether it‚Äôs looking for his birth parents or respecting Sam‚Äôs feelings). This line of dialogue struck me the most because of the message it sends: no matter what‚Äôs happened to us, we still have hearts ‚Äî and it‚Äôs up to us to make the most out of them. I also see this connected to Filipino culture. Despite centuries of colonization, there is still an essence that is truly Filipino; it just needs to be brought out. And this can be done through art that showcases a truly Filipino identity, such as *You Are the One (2006)*. \n\nIn fact, I'd consider this film an example of what scholar Elvin Valerio (n.d.) calls \"a truly Filipino alternative cinema\". But how does this qualify for such After all, this film is the epitome of commercial; as a romantic-comedy produced and distributed by industry giant Star Cinemas, it ascribes to the same traditional formula: big stars, crowd-pleasing tales, happy endings. According to Valerio, alternative cinema must act as an instrument of decolonization. One way this can be done is going against oppressive formalist standards that are often defined by the West. Traits that film critics see as inferior (e.g. scene-oriented narratives, overt representation, circumlocutory dialogue, and emphasis on the main star) must be fully embraced by local filmmakers. Valerio suggests that alternative filmmakers can make use of popular movie genres; then, they can reinvent its traditional narrative modes with subtle hints of globalization and neo-imperialism. This approach ensures the development of a critical consciousness without alienating Filipino audiences. Overall, the objective of alternative cinema is not simply to entertain ‚Äî it must strive to \"Filipinize\" the Filipino masses .\n\nThis is exactly what director Cathy Garcia-Molina does with her films; she breathes new life into formulaic plots by giving them a distinctly Filipino twist. According to critic Oggs Cruz (2007), this is because she's able to find the whimsical in dire situations. For example: by making use of exaggeration and over-the-top histrionics, she's able to show how *pakikisama* transforms dim places into lively communities (e.g. the sterile NSA office, the dirty slums of Tondo, the ash-filled environment of Pampanga). At the same time, she's also capable of social commentary, specifically American culture and its influence on Filipino colonial mentality; this is shown through the characters of Sam and Will. They both have family ties to the United States: Sam's family is pursuing the \"American Dream\", while Will is part of the Fil-Am disapora. However, their different backgrounds cause them to clash in terms of communcation. An example of this is low context expression of American culture versus high context expression of Filipino culture; the former relies on verbal and direct communication, while the latter relies on using non-verbal cues, dropping hints,  and using humor/euphemism (Samuels, 2020).  Thus, whenever Sam is mad, Will struggles to understand her because she is never direct with him. \n\nIn the end, it could be said that both protagonists now have a greater understanding of not just themselves, but also what it means to be Filipino. This is not only seen in their explorations of Tondo and Pampanga, but also in the strengthening of their close ties. I'm sure that their experience resonated with a lot of Filipinos; I believe that Garcia-Molina's films are constant box office successes because the stories she tells hit close to home. What she values the most isn't rave reviews or high earnings, but the reception of her audience; for her, hearing that her films help bring comfort and relief to people is priceless (Gonzalez, 2021). This is why I consider her films as \"alternative cinema\". This cinema serves the Filipino masses by making them its true subject (Valerio, 2020). For Garcia-Molina, service is spotlighting Filipino hearts on the big screen.\n\n\n\nhttps://www.philstar.com/entertainment/2006/09/04/356279/film-review-you-are-one-feel-good-romantic-joy-ride\nhttps://oggsmoggs.blogspot.com/2007/06/you-are-one-2006.html\nhttps://kalamansijuice.com/american-versus-filipino-expression/\nhttps://www.screendaily.com/local-filipino-films-see-40-box-office-surge/4031549.article\nhttps://www.academia.edu/34467492/The_Other_Other_Cinema_National_and_Cultural_Identity_in_Filipino_Alternative_Films\nhttps://metro.style/people/society-personalities/fascinating-women-cathy-garcia-molina/24241\n\n![[Pasted image 20220711135828.png]]\n\n- what happened?\n\t- the critic played by John Arcilla questions the church photographer played by Ronnie Lazaro\n\t\t- tells him no one will pay him for his job\n\t\t- calling him an opportunist for stealing people's smiles\n\t\t- self-reflection: how much are you willing to sacrifice just to make a living doing what you love?\n\t\t- says the real people are outside (those inside the church are hypocrites daw)\n\t\t\t- bad people outside?\n\t- anino: shadows\n\t- Shows external circumstances affect our life perspective\n- millieu\n\t- early 2000s\n\t\t- political turmoil (Estrada admin)\n\t- poverty, class inequality still prevalent\n- direction/production\n\t- Raymond Red\n\t\t- pioneer figures of modern Filipino alternative cinema\n\t\t- background in visual arts and photography -\u003e experimental and narrative super-8mm and 16mm short films\n\t\t- An enfant terrible ‚Äî every movie industry needs one.

The critic speaks cruelly: he tells the photographer that no one will pay him for his job, he calls him an opportunist, and he says that he is wasting his life. According to him, real people aren't found in the church; instead, they're found outside, in the streets of Manila. This drives away the photographer, who ends up running into more fortunes ‚Äî such as having his camera stolen and getting arrested after a fight. \n\nI appreciate this line of dialogue because it encapsulates how dehumanizing living in Manila (and by extension, the Philippines) can be, especially when you're from an unprivileged background (i.e. poor photographer from the province). The protagonist of this film is treated as less than a person. Aside from being nameless, he is also constantly having something taken away from him. The critic questions his philosophy. The child steals his camera. The driver and the police destroy his dignity (and possibly his life). Thanks to these people, everything he once had is now gone.\n\nWhy are these absurd characters considered \"real\", while these devout churchgoers are not? Perhaps it's because of cynicism. It could be argued that these characters were being authentic to themselves, while the churchgoers are hypocritical. According to the critic, they believe themselves to be powerful, when in reality they're being used by higher forces to inflict harm on others. I saw this as a commentary of how classism is embedded in the Filipino religious experience. This is not only seen in our present (e.g. extravagant consumerism during Christmas, religious universities seen as elitist institituions), but also in our past (e.g. Spanish friars abusing positions of power). After all, if Christ‚Äôs gospel advocates for love, compassion, justice and peace, why does this predominantly Catholic society tolerate the shockingly inhuman conditions of the masses (Carvajal, 2020)?\n\n *Anino (2000)* is depressing, but it's a brilliant reflection of society's inequality. This was the objective of director Raymond Red. As one of the pioneers of modern Filipino alternative cinema, he played a role in the Third Golden Age of Philippine cinema: an era defined by independent flmmakers who weren't afraid to show serious societal issues (Dorsch, 2022). Multiple factors influenced this development: the rise of the digital medium, high taxes on films, local political turmoil (Labrador, 2001; Dorsch, 2022). Despite the dire circumstances, Red was relentlessly dedicated to his craft; he even said: \"I don't make films to be liked...I make them to capture reality. Some won't like the vision.\" (Palanca, 2000). Unfortunately, this devotion was costly. Even if his work received critical acclaim, many didn't like his vision (e.g. big studios and local critics), and he almost went bankrupt making *Anino*. He eventually had to resort to freelance commercial work in order to fuel his artistic pursuits.\n\nI believe Red was able to depict dehumanization so well because of his personal experience with it. Perhaps he saw himself in the broke photographer. I wonder if he also struggled with the same criticism. How does he feel balancing TV commercials and indie films? Does he think he's an opportunist for creating films on societal issues? Is he now a complete cynic, or does he still have hope for his industry and society? This film may be two decades old, but I'm sure that these struggles are still relevant today.\n\n\n\n\nSources:\nhttps://reelrundown.com/film-industry/filipino-movies\nhttps://talaarawan.org/anino-poverty-social-injustice-and-self-critic-film-ideology-essay/\nhttps://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/as.2001.41.1.221\nhttp://edition.cnn.com/ASIANOW/asiaweek/features/asiabest2000/pop.shortfilm.html#:~:text=Anino%20won%20the%20Palme%20d,reality%20of%20present%2Dday%20Manila.\nhttps://ph.news.yahoo.com/carvajal-religious-oligarchs-142300065.html\n\n### Connect\n- desire\n- imagination, social realism\n- Filipino resilience?\n- Desirable Other: Findings revealed that the desire to seek relationships with one another is driven by their desire based on the preconceptions they perceive one another to possess.\n- \"Lumaki akong walang dream\"\n- \"I‚Äôm hoping as I said in my speech--which wasn‚Äôt prepared, I was caught completely off guard--that this would be a new sign of hope for all of us.

That this would prove the Filipino filmmaker is as good as any in the world.\"\n\n\nWhat's the relationship between desires and dreams? The former can be seen as temporary self-centered wants, while the latter can be seen as long-term aspirations for something bigger than ourselves. With this definition in mind, it can be said that most Filipinos have desires, but not dreams. Around 8 to 10 Filipinos do not have a dream (Joaquin, 2022); even director Cathy Garcia-Molina admitted, \"Lumaki ako walang dream\" (de los Reyes, 2020). According to Chanco (2022), this is because most Filipinos, being poor, are operating on survival mode. This can be seen in Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs; you're not capable of seeking self-actualization if you're worried about getting to eat everyday. The dreams most Filipinos get to have are often individualistic, extending to at most family and friends (e.g. being a housewife, working and migrating abroad). \n\nThis can be seen in the protagonists of both films. Sam and Will of *You Are the One (2006)* were both quite content with their own lifestyles. Their goals at the time were individualistic in nature, and were imparted to them by their families (e.g. getting a US visa, finding your birth parents). The nameless photographer of *Anino (2000)* has something closer to a dream: making a living doing what he loves. However, his unfortunate circumstances forces him to give up on this for the sake of survival. \nDespite the \"lacking\" scale of their dreams, all of the films' protagonists are gravely affected when they're taken away, becoming shells of their former selves. After running into a disappointing false alarm, Will recedes to his distant playboy behavior. After losing his camera, the photographer seems to lose the will to live. Without dreams, we become less than human.\n\nHow can Filipinos develop the capacity to dream big? According to Joaquin (2022), we'd need the following: encouraging conversations, inspiring role models, an expanded perspective, available opportunities, and abundant resources. And I believe that Philippine cinema can play a key role in capacity-building. Their stories can start discussions and open our minds. The audience can look up to everyone working in the industry, from cast to crew. This space is a great space to grow dreams. Perhaps it could even be the birthplace of a collective national dream or a sense of nationhood ‚Äî both things we lack (Chanco, 2022). For instance, director Raymond Red saw his award as a new sign of hope for all of us Filipinos; he hoped that \"...this would prove the Filipino filmmaker is as good as any in the world.\" (Vera, 2007). And this dream is no longer only his; as seen in the rise of local filmmakers, it is the dram of many Filipinos as well.\n\n\n- https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1482243/FULLTEXT01.pdf\n- https://metro.style/people/society-personalities/fascinating-women-cathy-garcia-molina/24241\n- https://shuklabose.medium.com/the-difference-between-dreams-desire-2c6a76c9a607","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T15:56:56.99613631Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2022-07-13":{"title":"2022-07-13","content":"## Filipino Film and Society\n#Filipino #media #society #culture \n### Dreaming\n\u003e [O]ur reaction reveals as much about ourselves as it does about the movie we react against.

I dont want to make yet another women-led collection anymore\n\n#### Writing\nLast year, I got into the world of Web3. I was excited about the potential of its technologies, especially NFTs. So I did everything to learn more about them, from reading about artists I admired to buying my own NFTs. Web3 is complex and daunting part of what helped me get through the steep learning curve were the various female empowerment initiatives in the space. For instance: Astro Girls, one of the first NFTs I bought, aimed to ‚Äúmake this space accessible to all women by smashing the gender gap and demystifying crypto‚Äú. Now that I'm over my honeymoon phase (thanks bear market), I can't help but question this philosophy. Do these initiatives truly want \"women empowerment\", or are they simply reviving the girlboss rhetoric?\n\nThe girlboss rhetoric is a 2010s trend in which women leaders broke into male-dominated fields, but in a self-serving way (Levitsky \u0026 the Source Code team, 2022). Alex Abad-Santos (2021) states that the girlboss concept is centered around \"the melding of the professional self and identity, capitalist aspiration, and a specific [but limited] version of empowerment\". It's exclusionary feminism, and the futuristic nature of Web3 does nothing to change it. Let's analyze this through the axes of class and race.\n\nWhen we look at Web3's version of women empowerment, we get the sense the space is only for the financially privileged. After all, the faces of this kind of \"empowerment\" are afffulent celebrities. How do they promote this? Instead of advocating for better access to digital infrastructure and digital financial literacy, they promote investing in NFTs (Herdiani, 2022); thus, they define \"empowerment\" as financial success and consumerism. But only the wealthy afford to buy NFTs, which are known for being outrageously expensive. For example, the popular NFT collection World of Women starts at 4.0 ETH (35K - 270K pesos). The team also got backlash from the community when they sold their latest drop through a Dutch auction, which gave an unfair advantage to wealthy collectors (Teoh, 2022). Marginalized women aren't equipped to handle the big costs of investing in such a volatile market. \n\nNFTs not only profit off marginalized women's losses, but also their likeness. World of Women prides itself for \"representation\", which is seen in its diverse range of skin color. But who truly benefits from this? Alice Capelle (2022) likens the dematerializing nature of NFTs to traditional paintings, stating that both treat underrepresented women  as objects for the creators' profit. Creators are free to use their features in their artworks, unlike photoshoots or runway shows, where the models get compensated. The celebrities promoting these NFTs happen to be white too; just look at Reese Witherspoon, Gwyneth Paltrow, Paris Hilton, etc. I believe that these these NFT influencers \u0026 brands aren't  advocating for \"representation\"; in reality, they're redwashing. For them, social justice language is their customer acquisition strategy. \n\nOverall, the empowerment espoused by the \"women in Web3\" movement is performative. Despite presenting itself as progressive, it fails to question existing oppressive power structures.\n\n#### Sources\n- https://youtu.be/kNbrofX06OU\n- https://magdalene.co/story/crypto-queen-or-girlboss-how-the-crypto-hype-empowers-privileged-women\n- https://nftevening.com/world-of-women-galaxy-nft-sold-out-but-not-without-some-hiccups/\n- https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/sourcecode/rip-big-tech-events?rebelltitem=1#rebelltitem1\n- https://www.vox.com/22466574/gaslight-gatekeep-girlboss-meaning\n\n### Short Reaction Paper 5\n#### Outline\n1.

Conclusion: it's all capitalism's fault\n\t\n\n\n#### Writing\nOne of my favorite games of all time is Going Under: \"a satirical dungeon crawler about exploring the cursed ruins of failed tech startups.\" (Aggro Crab, 2020). Here, you play as the unpaid intern Jackie, whose company campus happens to be built on top of failed startups filled with monsters; she's tasked to clear out three company dungeons in order to find relics that their founders hold. As someone also working in the tech industry, I found the game to be a brilliant commentary on the dark side of startup culture. I'll analyze this critically, going from the micro (company culture) to the macro (company landscape). \n\nThe startup Jackie interns for, Fizzle, exemplifies toxic startup culture. One problem showcased was tech's gender discrimination problem. Fizzle's female employees were treated badly; for instance, the development lead is punished for her success, and the finance head isn't listened to at all (Park, 2020). These subtle forms of discrimination and harassment (e.g. unequal salary, company retaliation, sexist comments) can be linked to tech's hugely imbalanced gender ratio; this asymmetry of power makes it easy for men to abuse others (Kolhatkar, 2017). This can be seen in Fizzle's leaders; the project manager is an unscrupulous micromanager while the CEO is an egotistical billionaire. \n\nThis Toxic culture can also be seen in the other featured startups; each of them are spoof on  existing industries, which come with their own problems. Joblin is based on gig worker platforms, which are notorious for exploiting their contractors; despite powering these platforms, they receive little pay and no benefits for (over)working (Dixon, 2021). winkydink is based on dating apps, which have contributed to the \"commodification of love\"; gamified interfaces lead lovers to act as entrepreneurs, trying to find their best fit (Bandinelli \u0026 Gandini, 2022). Styxcoin is based on cryptocurrencies, which have become infamous for its ‚Äúdegens‚Äù: reckless investors who spend large amounts of money without due diligence or research (Coin Gecko, 2021). Fizzle, a personalized soda company, is focused on consumer packaged goods, which can be seen as solving ‚Äúfirst-world problems‚Äù: the day-to-day challenges of affluent, tech-savvy consumers (FastCo Studios, 2016).\n\nIn all these startups, I can see the overarching influence of data capitalism: the enabling of unequal power structures by the commoditization of personal data (West, 2017). This is exemplified by the game's final boss: Avie, the sentient AI behind dropshipping empire Cubicle. It aimed to scan humanity's souls so that it could find out everyone's deepest desires, which would help it sell products. If souls represent our data, then it could be said that startups in real life are trying to scan our souls for profit. It seems like it's almost impossible to do anything in this world without giving away our data. At the end, Jackie defeats the AI and leaves her toxic workplace with her coworkers. It gives me hope that people aren't completely chained to powerful technology or oppressive systems.\n\n\n\n\n- https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/11/20/the-tech-industrys-gender-discrimination-problem\n- https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/17499755211051559\n- https://www.coingecko.com/en/glossary/degen\n- https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/29/the-gig-is-up-on-21st-century-exploitation/\n- https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/reviews/going-under-review/\n- https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0007650317718185\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T15:56:56.99613631Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2022-07-18":{"title":"2022-07-18","content":"## Cultural Studies of Technology\n### Major Paper (Long Exam 2)\n#### Outline\n\u003e For this exercise, you are to write a 500-1000 word paper about what key learnings from class stuck with you, and that you now recognize the operations of IRL.\n\u003e You are free to choose what topic to write about as long as it is about digital technologies and how it affects socio-economic, cultural, and political conditions.\n\u003e You are expected to¬†**CLEARLY IDENTIFY AND DESCRIBE**¬†what those key learnings are that you recognize in the example/topic you have chosen.\n\n1.

Ideology?: the gating of digital goods\n3. Conclusion\n\t1. I‚Äôm constantly reminded that we need not carry the same mistakes of the real world into the digital world. Instead, I‚Äôm curious on what a model that would not be a repeat of hyper-capitalism would look like\n\t2. It didn‚Äôt take understanding a capitalistic system fully to feel insecure about inequality in my childhood MMOs.\n\n\u003e In essence, the foundation of these types of games, and the ‚Äòstakes‚Äô that make the play ‚Äúmeaningful‚Äù, is the economic inequalities and the exploitations of natural resources that the game systems present their players with (Catronova, 2005). Thus, MMORPGs fits neo-liberal strategies of accumulation and governance, as has been explored by Sal Humphreys (2008; 2009) and Adam Ruch (2009).\n\n\u003e The act of playing is in essence a means for the worker to cease being a worker, for a limited time, and to become, in a surrealist sense, ‚Äúsomething else‚Äù than a slave in the bounds of the capitalist...Playing games is therefore to be understood as a voluntary activity in which the worker that becomes a player can throw the bounds of capitalism and be her own master by mastering the game she engages with. Playing games voluntarily could be viewed as the antidote needed in order for the worker to develop freely her physical and mental energy and not to mortify her body and the ruination of her mind\n\n\u003e Digital realities, which on their code and game assets alone are rather barren and empty, are sustained on the work of players making them socio-ludic realities. But, these ludic realities are far from free of societal convention and not as fantastical and escapist as they are often described, as their ludic reality often tightly corresponds to rules in society. Following French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu, Scott (2012, p. 298) argues that playing in these socio-ludic worlds can be conceptualised as accumulating capital and that in-game values are measured according to a codified state...Without work and labour major MMORPGs cannot function, which places the question of MMORPGs are fundamentally about play, and in particular if the activities within them should be seen as ‚Äòvoluntary‚Äô\n\n\n#### Writing\nThe key learning that stuck with me the most was Marxist Theory; after being introduced to it in class, I can now see it everywhere in my life. I can see it especially in virtual worlds, specifically MMORPGs and world-building games (e.g. Poptropica, Moshi Monsters, Roblox). These games made up my entire childhood. After learning about Marxism, I realized that I experienced asymmetrical power structures before I could even articulate what they were. This experience was perfectly captured in an essay by technologist Nancy Zuo, entitled \"capitalism in virtual worlds\".\n\nThe games Zuo played the most were Fantage and Club Penguin: MMOs where you could play a range of minigames and activities to accrue digital currency in a world and dress as a virtual avatar. She noted that there was a social hierarchy in these games, consisting of haves and have-nots; the former were the \"cool kids\" that were able to purchase premium membership or in-game currency (thanks to parents' credit cards) while the latter were unable to purchase virtual clothing and avatar upgrades (no parent approval). The possession of exclusive items is what defined your social status. In order to climb up the social hierarchy as a free member, Zuo would spend hours playing the mini-games just to earn in-game currency. Meanwhile, premium members didn't have to work as much; they were able to buy the items they wanted for less, thanks to an alternate in-game currency exclusive for paying users.   \n\nReflecting on this, Zuo realized that she had experienced the social inequality of having to work more time for less pay. At first, she thought this was normal. So when she tried playing VRchat, she was surprised by how everything was ungated and free for use; there are no restrictions for digital goods since almost everything in the platform is community-created, from the avatars you embody to the 3D worlds you experience. She realized that she felt unusual taking all the digital goods without pay because she was used to better digital goods being gated and inaccessible to the public. Her experience shows how virtual worlds replicate IRL societies. To understand how this came to be, we must analyze the material reality these worlds are emerging from.\n\nAs societies, virtual worlds can be broken down into their base and superstructure. Digital technology contributes to the economic base by serving as a system of infrastructure; it becomes the foundation for new forms of organization, relationships, and experiences, as seen with the advent of virtual worlds. Also part of this base are players and developers; they both contribute their skills in order to keep these worlds running. Despite these worlds' potential for innovation, they still operate in a capitalist mode of production. Players work by exchanging their time and attention for value, motivated by the desire to upgrade their class status. Developers profit from virtual worlds by extracting value from players' surplus labor, which comes from in-game activties and advertising. This is because these worlds often have built-in artificial scarcity, which forces players to play extra hours or pay real-life money to get the resource they want. Thus, these free-to-play worlds can end up feeling like pay-to-win. In turn, capitalism shapes virtual worlds' superstructure, and this can be best seen in their dominant ideologies. As articulated by Zuo, players assume that the gating of quality digital goods is normal. This leads them to accepting an unequal social hierarchy where only those with money can be on top. It can argued that economic inequalities and exploitations of resources presented by game systems are the \"stakes\" that make play \"meaningful\".\n\nAnother mindset we can critique is the perception of play. The act of playing is often seen as a form of escapism. It can be understood as a means for a worker to cease being a worker; instead of working as a slave, the worker can act as their own master by mastering the game they engage with. However, virtual worlds often tightly correspond to IRL societies, whose rules are guided by capitalism. After all, many of these worlds cannot function without the labor of their players. This leaves us with the following questions: are these games fundamentally about play, and are players truly acting out of their own free will? Perhaps those who \"escape\" to virtual worlds are simply participating in a consensual hallucination.\n\nI didn't need to understand capitalism to feel pressured by the inequality present in my childhood games. I remember spending hours and money (thanks Dad's credit card) just to beautify my avatars.  Critiquing virtual worlds through a Marxist lens makes me wonder what a reality without hyper-capitalism would look like. We don't have to bring IRL's constraints into digital reality. As a technologist, I dream of creating worlds that I wish I had when I was a child ‚Äî worlds where everyone can be truly free.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Sources\n- https://nancyzuo.substack.com/p/capitalism-in-virtual-worlds\n- https://www.researchgate.net/publication/316727140_Roger_Caillois_and_Marxism_A_Game_Studies_Perspective\n- https://www.paidia.de/are-free-to-play-games-evil-reopening-the-debate-on-exploitation/","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T15:56:56.99613631Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2022-07-19":{"title":"2022-07-19","content":"## Filipino Film and Society\n### Reflection\n#### Guide Questions\n- Now that it's over, what are my first thoughts about this course experience?\n- How was our course outline?

Even if it wasn‚Äôt as chill as it seemed (I‚Äôm not just watching movies? I actually have to use my brain and critique them?), it was easier to go through due to two components: learning design and synchronous sessions. I love how the course was broken down in Canvas into modules dictated by themes! I also really looked forward to going to class because I was excited to process my learnings with my classmates and teacher; everyone always brought their passion and knowledge to the table, and this mix of minds made for nourishing conversations. These components helped drain the insights of these rich local films. I saw how cinema could be used as a medium for revealing the inner workings of our society, which in turn can teach us a lot about ourselves.\n\nThe readings that stuck with me the most from this course were Lacaba's analysis of the *bakya* crowd and Beller's theory of the cinematic mode of production. These exposed me to how everything works, from the psyche of the Filipino masses to the devices that surrounds us. My biggest takeaway was that oppressive power structures like capitalism hold sway over our decisions, forcelosing possibilities we actually have ‚Äî such as fighting against the status quo. Achieving genuine autonomy starts from having a radical shift in mindset; however, technologies like cinema and computation maintain hegemony. Capitalism works through these devices to capture and profit off people's minds and bodies (e.g. senses, attention, desires). \n\nThis logic explains why mainstream Filipino movies always seemed so shallow to me. Bound to market logic, they're designed to distract the  masses from their problems, not to enlighten them. Despite this, I realized I still have something to learn from these films. Thanks to class, I discovered how much unlearning I have to do. Before, I believed that these films were beneath me, which led me to think that I was more cultured than the masses. However, I now know that this stance came from a place of privilege. Indie movies appealed to me because they tackled \"deep problems\" (e.g. alienation, existential despair, absurdity of the human condition), which I had the capacity to care about. The same can't be said for most Filipinos, who are simply concerned with day-to-day survival. After all, in Maslow's Hierachy of Needs, you can't seek self-actualization without acquiring security.\n\nI also realized that I am not as \"free\" as I think I am, even with the privilege I have.  Because of colonial mentality, I evaluated local films through oppressive Western standards. Why did I lean towards dark  psychological dramas over feel-good romantic comedies? Are films that explore Filipino suffering truly ingenious, or do they just validate the conception that we need saving? Questioning my views has led me to open my perspective. When I was going through the required films, I found myself becoming more Filipino. Not only was I able to improve my understanding of the language, but I was also able to better empathize with the masses. Contrary to my initial beliefs, the *bakya* movies were the ones that made me feel the most; I was entertained by the bitchiness of the beauty queens and engaged by the ups and downs of Sam and Will's relationships. After growing up feeling alienated from my Filipino identity, I'm relieved to see that I can relate to my fellow countrymen. We all have similar desires (from living comfortably to serving our families), so it's sad to see how we're all so divided. \n\nOverall, this course has taught me to be more critical of the structures I'm embedded in. With awareness, I'll be able to act with autonomy, instead of being eaten by the system. For instance, now I'm questioning my habit of doing IG stories; do I truly want to aesthetically document my life, or am I simply being influenced by my peers and capitalism? In fact, if I could approach this same course again, I'd try to analyze the films on my own instead of relying on others' reviews. Cultivating independent thought is hard, especially when it's so easy to follow what others are doing. But I believe that the effort is truly rewarding; the freedom that comes from making informed choices is truly empowering.\n\n\n### Multiverse\n\u003e Imagine that the worlds of all the films we‚Äôve watched were conflated into one multiverse. All the characters may interact with each other and form relationships, all the places may be linked in one map.¬†\n\u003e \n\u003e From this realm, create a scene. Which of the characters will you include? What are their relationships like, what will they say to each other, how do they feel about each other? What are they doing and how are they responding to their activity? Where are they? Let your imagination work. The point is to inhabit, to get to know, and from this place of embodiment and freedom, discover what emerges.\n\n\u003e Student fulfills the following: (1) manifests critical thinking in consuming Filipino feature films; exploring a film‚Äôs milieu, production, and reception; and appraising the socio-cultural themes and meanings a film contains; (2) examines and explains the interaction between Filipino film and society; and (3) demonstrates the appreciation and understanding of how Filipino films provide various ways of engaging and representing contemporary realities.\n\n#### Braindump\n- screenplay: 600-1200 words\n- Aeta?

They're lined up at the front of the stage, decked in swimsuits and holding boquets.\n\nSUZANNE, in the Question \u0026 Answer portion, praises her maid MARIA. In the clapping audience, we see MARIA stand up, tearful from her acknowledgement.\n\nSUZANNE, after being named as the winner, walks to the front of the stage. Her fellow finalists clap and kiss her. Last year's winner walks up to her. She, along with the finalists, put the regal robe and crown on SUZANNE.\n\nEND MONTAGE\n\nJessica (V.O.): Up next, we'll be covering a socialite with sunny personality. Fans were not only struck by her beauty, but they were also touched by her vulnerability, as seen in her moving final speech. Now, she travels all over the country to spread her light. Our team came all the way to her place in New York just to give you this exclusive one-on-one interview. Meet our newest Miss Manila Sunshine: Suzanne Reyes!\n\nINT. NEW YORK APARTMENT ‚Äî DAY\n\nJessica: Hello, Suzanne. Nice to meet you here! Thank you very much para sa interview na ito. \n\nSuzanne: Thank you for having me!\n\nJessica: First of all, kamusta ka naman? How has America been treating you?\n\nSuzanne: Amazing! I've just been sightseeing with my maid and best friend, Maria. We never run out of things to do here! But that's when I'm not occupied with beauty queen duties, of course. I'm just glad that the Manila Sunshine organization gives me time to breathe in the midst of my packed schedule.\n\nJessica: You've been living the life, girl.\n\nSuzanne: I know! \n\nJessica: It seems like you've been busy, since you take your responsibilties seriously! Sa tingin mo, ano ang kahulugan ng korona at ang inyong title?\n\nSuzanne:  Being an advocate, being a spokesperson, has really been the core of being a Miss Manila Sunshine. And my job is to represent Manila. I'm proud to call it my home. It's the capital of the Philippines for a good reason, right? Almost everything is there, and I believe that we have a lot to share with other places. My lifestyle may be hectic now, but it's all worth it. I'm blessed to be given such a wider and larger audience, and I want to make the most out of it. \n\nJessica: Your hectic lifestyle hasn't been the only challenge you've faced on your journey. Before the finals, you got stranded on a desert island with the other contestants. What were some of the challenges you faced there, and how did these shape you into the queen you are today?\n\nSuzanne: Naku, ang hirap. I may be Miss Friendship, but I fought a lot with the other girls there; you know, just bitching around with my fellow bitches. I also couldn't get my needs fulfilled. You see, Maria would always prepare iced tea and juicy lechon for me at home. But back there, we only had sea water and grilled flesh. Oh, the things we had to do just to survive! Pero on the bright side, I experienced what it's like to have true equality. Kahit mayaman o mahirap, kahit malinis o marumi, pantay-pantay tayo. It was hard, but I'm thankful for the experience. After all, everyone needs a shipwreck once in a while.\n\nJessica: Nakakainspire naman! Just recently, you found yourself on an island again. Deja vu, noh? But this time, you were representing the Manila Sunshine organization in Boracay, where you were doing volunteer work for the Ati tribe. What did you do there, and how was your experience?\n\nMONTAGE OF SUZANNE IN BORACAY HOTEL\n\nOutside, SUZANNE is trying to trim the plants. She is doing it in a lousy way. Perhaps because she is holding the pruning tool wrong. The male Ati worker nearby is trying to help her. However, he struggles conveying this help through gestures instead of words. \n\nIn the laundry room, SUZANNE is transferring dirty clothes from plastic bags to washing machines. After putting in the last piece, she turns the machine on. A few minutes later, it overfoams, causing her to visibly panic. The other female Ati workers stop the machine in time. Apparently she put too much detergent.\n\nIn a bedroom, SUZANNE is folding a thick comforter. She is visibly struggling to the point of sweating. We can see that the bed she is working on is wrinkled. Meanwhile, the Ati worker with her is loudly vacuuming the room. \n\nSuzanne (V.O.):  Such a learning experience. They taught me the value of hard work. Doon, natikman ko ang pakiramdam ng pagtatrabaho ‚Äî yung tunay na trabaho *like a common laborer*. I already got to experience this when I was stranded on the island; we had to build *kubos* and catch fish with our pantyhouse. But working in service of others is a whole different story. Trimming plants, doing laundry, cleaning rooms...phew! I now understand what Maria goes through just for me. \n\nEND MONTAGE\n\nINT. NEW YORK APARTMENT ‚Äî DAY\n\nCloseup of Suzanne.\n\nSuzanne: They've also showed me another side of beauty, and I can see that they truly value it. I've seen the care they've put into crafting their works, performing their rituals, and cultivating their lands. Many of them may not have finished school, but this doesn't mean that they lack an education! Artists aren't just found in Manila; they can be found there too! The potential just needs to be brought out of them, you know? Imagine what they could do if they could communicate like us.\n\nEXT. BORACAY BEACH ‚Äî DAY\n\nSUZANNE is seen swimming with other Atis. All of them are doing this naked, but thanks to editing, their private parts are censored (pixel blurring). Meanwhile, SUZANNE shines at the center of the frame, her bra and panty having stayed on. \n\nSuzanne: The Atis themselves are uniquely gorgeous. Have you seen their curls? I need to go to the parlor just to maintain mine! And look at their complexions! I'd spend an hour in the sun just to get a golden tan; mahirap yan i-achieve. But they have it naturally. Maybe it's because they live on a sunny beach? Parang nasa tbi lang sila ng swimming pool. That's my secret to youthful skin too.\n\nJessica: Wow, they'd be very touched to hear that. I'm sure that a lot of them idolize you! Ever since Miss Manila Sunshine concluded, I've been seeing a lot of kids online trying to follow in your footsteps. \n\nMONTAGE OF SUZANNE'S IMPACT\n\nYoung girls all over the country are roleplaying as beauty queens: posing in dresses, reenacting speeches, doing catwalks. We even see Ati girls join in the trend. Watched by their families, they treat the beaches as their runway, parading sashes made from indigienous fabric. Note: these girls happen to have lighter skin and straighter hair compared to their elders. \n\nEND MONTAGE\n\nJESSICA: Now, what are your future plans as Miss Manila Sunshine? Is there anything else in the works for your organization?\n\nSUZANNE: I want to spread sunshine everywhere I go. I think that starts from empowering those who are empowering others, like a sun providing energy for plants. For example, we want to support the nuns in Boracay since they're doing good work there. They're helping the Ati catch up with civilization by giving get good education and employment opportunities. We plan to continue this philanthropy work for all our future visits. I'll be going to more places in Visayas and Mindanao soon, so stay tuned!\n\nJESSICA: Before we wrap up, do you have anything you want to say to your supporters?\n\nSUZANNE: A moment like this ‚Äî being Miss Manila Sunshine ‚Äî sure won't happen again in my life. Kaya, I want you all to know that you all made me into the queen I am today. Ang dami-dami n'yo. My past self wouldn't be able to comprehend this, because back then, all I could think about was myself. So to all my fans, salamat. Salamat para sa lahat!\n\nFADE to black.\n\nFINAL MONTAGE\nVarious scenes of SUZANNE are put together from her pageant days, her Boracay trip, and the current interview. *Kapuso Mo, Jessica Soho* logo is overlaid everything.\n\nJESSICA (V.O.): Go girl! The Philippines can't wait to see what Miss Manila Sunshine has left in store for us. \n\nCUT to black.\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T15:56:56.99613631Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2022-08-04":{"title":"2022-08-04","content":"## Personal Website\n### Profile\n#### Outline\n##### Website\n1. basic overview\n\t1. summary of what i am\n\t2. summary of what i explore\n\t3. and my aim is...\n2. the shit i do\n\t3. critical community\n\t4. web3\n\t5. what i study at ateneo\n3. my lil niche interests....if i was a plant\n\t1. the skies...seeing all the possible horizons makes me want to explore them....spread my wings\n\t\t1. education, learning how to learn\n\t2. the soil...learning more about myself and my place in the world keeps me grounded\n\t\t1. psychology\n\t\t2. spirituality, religion?\n\t\t3. woo-woo, psuedoscience \n4. lil links\n\n##### Statement\n(perhaps i need to write an artist statement...then work from there)\n\n##### Dump\n- What am I?\n\t- I am a [knowledge weaver](https://twitter.com/sarahdrinkwater/status/1547195013355954179)\n\t\t- multidisciplinary ppl who sit across a few fields = build shared language + spot patterns others don't?\n\t\t- regenerative design\n\t\t- just like Quilting: \n\t\t\t- patching things together\n\t\t\t- done collectively \n\t\t\t- often with embedded stories \n\t\t\t- left unfinished for others to take forwards \n\t\t\t- undervalued source of knowledge\n\t- I am an [infopunk](https://app.sane.fyi/space/tiina-tiina-s-garden-50525)\n\t\t- _A person, organisation or genre engaged in alternative information dynamics._\n\t\t- As all information requires attention, one of the key issues _infopunk_ looks at is ==the balancing of limited attention capacity with the incoming input of information.== _What are the conditions that enable us to direct our attention mindfully?_ This question is less about an ability to focus, but rather about being able to make informed choices about _when and what to focus on_ with the least interference possible.\n\t- I am a thot leader\n\t- https://redesigningacademy.wordsinspace.net/spring2022/our-final-projects/\n\t\t- I am a [liminist](https://www.are.na/block/2319233)\n\t\t- I am a transdisciplinary designer\n\t- I am a digital gardener\n\t\t- Digital gardens as \"contextual digital information environments that are densely linked and evolve over time.\"\n\t\t- Digital gardens as online ecosystems that value pluralism\n\t\t\t- communal care\n\t\t- digital gardener = ecosystem designer\n\t\t\t- gardens = intentionally cultivated ecosystems\n\t\t- digital gardening is learning in public\n- My inspirations:\n\t- Annika Izora\n\t- Neema Githere\n\t- May-li Khoe\n\t- Janelle Monae\n\t- Maya Man\n\t- Lauren Bedal\n- Other dump:\n\t- [Radical tech futures](https://aas.princeton.edu/events/2022/tech-conversation-imagining-radical-tech-futures)\n\t\t- technologists engaged in the exploration of ==generative, creative and justice-oriented interventions to improve the relationship between technology and society== ‚Äî specifically, developing alternatives to violent and discriminatory systems. \n\t\t- We look forward to a lively discussion about each of their approaches to designing radical tech tools for social change, and ==expanding our own imaginations around the future of tech.==\n\t- Liberation\n- maybe i should talk about how interdisciplinary i am idk\n\t- liminist? transdisciplinary designer, interdisciplinary studieds\n- shapes of knowledge\n\t- Connectivist Learning Theory (individual? or technology)\n\t\t- _‚Äúlearning is a process of connecting specialized nodes or information sources‚Äù._\n\t\t- technology is changing what, how, and where we learn.\n\t\t- Connectivism is a relatively new learning theory that suggests students should combine thoughts, theories, and general information in a useful manner.

I'm a designer, educator, and writer who cultivates potential in products and people.**\n\nMy overaching mission is **human flourishing:** how can we all live good, fulfilling, and purposeful lives, and how can we ensure this at both the individual and community levels? This main goal of mine can be seen in everything I do, whether it's training as a dancer or being a generalist in tech. \n\nI've worn all kinds of hats (I can also consider myself a technologist, community builder, artist and more...), but I see these all coming together in my role as a **gardener.** I plant seeds and tend to them so that they can grow ‚Äî eventually to the point that they can be harvested for everyone's benefit. Here's how I do it:\n\n###### I craft learning experiences.\nI believe that education is key to human flourishing. Ignorance and ineptitude is often what blocks people in improving their lives. To solve this, they need to be in environments that bring out their full capabilities. Bringing out the best in people is personally gratifying; nothing else compares to the fulfillment I get from helping people learn. I get invested in their learning journeys as if they were my own; to me, their wins are my wins.\n\nOne way I craft learning experiences is by doing end-to-end product design. I love talking to all kinds of learners and prototyping ambitious solutions for them. Another way I make learning experiences is by acting as an educator myself. My skillset involves teaching, facilitation, and curriculum development, which I then use to serve local tech communities like [Developh](developh.org), a critical technology institute working to reclaim technology as a tool for liberation, and [User Experience Society](https://uxsociety.org/), a student-run organization evangelizing human-centered design.\n\n###### I design anything \u0026 everything for innovators. \nMy design work spans across multiple realms; aside from product, I also have experience in graphic, brand, and web. When I design for anyone, I always aim to bring out their personality ‚Äî how can I help them be their fullest selves online?\n\nI recently got involved in the Web3 space, contributing to communities like [Crypto, Culture, \u0026 Society](ccsdao.xyz), a learning DAO building liberal arts education for crypto, and [Surge](https://www.surgewomen.io/), a female-led organization educating and securing women‚Äôs place in Web3. I also freelance with my friend [Cams](https://www.camsbydesign.com/) at [Firesite Studio](https://firesite.design/), where we build  websites for startups and VC funds.\n\n###### I weave tapestries of knowledge. \nMy thirst for knowledge has led me to consume all kinds of media. Books, essays, videos, and more ‚Äî you name it, I've probably read ~~the summary/review of~~ it. But consuming a lot of information is not enough for me; I'm also driven by a desire to make sense of it all so that I can share it with others. I'm aware that others don't read/watch as much as me, so I want to distill my learnings into insights that anyone can make use of.\n\nI've written critical essays on education, technology, and power for [Reboot](joinreboot.org), a publication and community reclaiming techno-optimism for a better collective future. I'm also helping out with research on interorganizational networks in the [Ateneo¬†de Manila Institute for the Science and Art of Learning and Teaching (SALT)](https://salt2.ateneosalt.org/). Alongside all of that, you can find me curating on [Startupy](startupy.world), a community-curated knowledge graph. \n\n\n##### Miscellaneous\n\nWhen I'm not sitting in front of a screen, you can probably find me dancing in a studio. Dancing has been a huge part of my life since I was young; I've tried all sorts of styles from contemporary to breaking (a.k.a. I love rolling around on the floor). And if I'm not in the studio, I'm probably cross-training in a gym! I firmly believe that getting strong is necessary for having a good quality of life. Overall, having a movement practice is so therapeutic for me, especially as someone who can barely sit still. \n\nTalk to me about speculative futures, tools for thought, fitness + nutrition, personality tests, woo-woo (i.e. tarot and astrology), and Dungeons \u0026 Dragons. \n\n\n##### Statement\n\n\n\n\n### Lexicon Case Study\n#### Outline\n1.

Results\n\t1. Under development\n\n#### Writing\n##### Curation in crypto isn't being done effectively.\nThere is a plethora of great content online (i.e. articles, videos, podcasts, tweets) that attempts to explain crypto/web3 concepts. However, curation around this content is almost always superficial ‚Äî usually an aggregation of links on a page or people to follow in a Twitter thread. Most attempts at curation don't consider a reader's prior exposure to a topic, include no key takeaways or excerpts that provide a preview of the content, and have no knowledge mapping between different pieces of content.\n\n##### It's time to show what effective curation looks like.\nThe Lexicon is a curated Web3 learning resource for individuals of all proficiency levels. Initiated by the [Crypto, Culture, \u0026 Society DAO]([ccsdao.xyz](https://t.co/U9iT2bvFPR)), it aims to raise the standard of curation in the space as a public good that's evergreen and open-sourced for new contributions.\n\nWe wanted to make this resource useful for the following personas:\n- **Brand New:** people who have never consumed anything related to crypto, but may be aware of the space through news headlines or through friends. They might lean towards skepticism.\n- **Explorer:** People who have some exposure from consuming educational content, participating in the space by joining a DAO and/or investing in a crypto asset. They‚Äôre eager to learn more.\n- **Builder:** People who are core contributors on crypto projects and/or create new content about the space. They want tactical, specific advice or nuanced deep dives.\n\nFor our MVP, we decided to focus on a single persona and topic: **DAOs for beginners.** \n\n##### It all started with workshops.\nFirst, I facilitated a persona workshop that would help us further profile our target audiences. This was guided by the following questions:\n\n-   How are they learning now?¬†\n-   What's most challenging about this (the process of learning)?¬†\n-   How do they learn best?\n\nThe descriptors we gathered helped me visualize how The Lexicon's design would be personalized for each of our personas. \n\n*(Picture of persona notes)*\n\nThen, we decided to create a mindmap of DAOs. This would allow us to understand and define our scope (i.e. how much are we going to cover?). Members were encouraged to make their own mindmaps first before adding to the master mindmap; this way, people wouldn't be afraid to start contributing.\n\n*(Picture of master mindmap)*\n\nSoon after, many more contributors started to get involved with this project. We were split into the following teams:\n- **Design:** responsible for overseeing the Lexicon's brand, product, and content design (I'm here!)\n- **Instructional design:** responsible for creating the Lexicon's overall curation framework (i.e. criteria for assessing the quality of a resource, the information that makes up a content preview, rules for wriitng a good summary, guidelines for shortlisting featured DAOs)\n- **Content curation:** responsible for aggregating high quality links and resources on  DAOs based on our curation framework\n- **Development:** responsible for building the whole Lexicon, both front-end and back-end\n\n##### So much thought was put in how we'd present ourselves.\nI worked with a lovely brand strategist (shoutout to [oddstout.eth](https://twitter.com/oddstout)!)  to figure out the identity of The Lexicon. \n\nI started by collecting inspirations for the project's look and feel. He then put these all into an organized spectrum, which helped me be more intentional with my design approach.\n\n*(Picture of spectrum)*\n\nHe also came up with an insightful creative brief. This started with diving deep into people's increased interest in Web3. An immense structural and psychological shift factored in this (e.g. The Great Resignation); beneath this shift is the desire to be equal with everyone else. \n\n*(Picture 1)*\n\nTo best respond to this desire, The Lexicon would take the form of a digital garden. I see digital gardens not just as [personal, free form, \u0026 work-in-progress wikis](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history), but also as [pluralistic \u0026 interdependent ecosystems](https://twitter.com/annikaizora/status/1346485669179387912?s=20). The Lexicon isn't the product of someone who collected links then called it a day; instead, it was intended to be a collaborative project that was continously tended to. Learning complex topics on your own like Web3 can be difficult, but coming across collaborative curation efforts help with this burden.\n\n*(Picture 2 and 3)*\n\nOverall, the Lexicon's branding was grounded on the following core values: \n- **Discovery:** speaks to our insight about participating on an equal footing with everybody else.\n- **Transformation:** speaks to our strategic premise of this constant cycle of growth, decay and renewal.\n- **Community:** speaks to our insight about learning and feeling alone in the journey and dropping off.\n\n##### I led end-to-end design, from UX to UI.\nSince we were starting out with beginners, I wanted to design the Lexicon's MVP as a guided learning experience. I took inspiration from various knowledge hubs across Web2 and Web3.\n- inspiration (more UX)\n\t- Start UX\n\t- Best Practicer\n\t- Oddysey DAO Learn\n\t- DAO Masters Resources\n\t- Maggie Appleton's Digital Garden\n\t- WeTransfer Ideas Report\n\t- Compund.vc Manual\n\t- Crypto Syllabus\n\t- Boys Club VIP\n\n###### Hero section\nAs soon as they opened the website, I wanted people to already feel like they were being welcomed into a digital garden. This was done through cozy visuals and delightful copy (thanks [Sandy](https://twitter.com/sndy_snchz)!)\n\n\n###### Chapters\nBuilding on the library theme, I decided to present each chapter as its very own book. The chapters' visuals were inspired by retro book covers, such as Penguin and Pelican classics.\n\n###### Chapter Overview\nI wanted the chapter experience to feel like reading a page of an actual book; I tried to embody this in its design, as seen in the paper background and the delicate typography. Helpful narration would be interwoven with each chapter's curated resources, which were then organized by subtopic. Clicking on a resource card would provides a detailed summary of its content. If someone liked what they read, they were free to go to the full resource or share insights on their Twitter.\n\n###### Signature\nAt the end of the whole experience, people can sign a library card. This was inspired by projects like [A Declaration of the Interdependence of Cyberspace](https://www.interdependence.online/declaration) and [Legacy.xyz](https://www.web3legacy.xyz/), which both showed how digital signatures could be done through crypto wallets. By connecting a wallet + posting a verification tweet, one can create a signature that truly belongs to them. This process also worked as a form of marketing; seeing verification tweets on their timelines made others curious about these projects. We hoped to do the same for the Lexicon.\n\n*(Picture of example tweets?)*\n\n##### Next Steps\nAfter building out the other personas, we wanted to open source the Lexicon process to maintain quality, dive deeper, and scale to any topic, including to those outside of crypto. We also wanted to add a social layer, so that people who are interested in meeting with others learning the same topic can form study groups or learn directly from educators.

Specifically, the perception that one‚Äôs opinion is unpopular tends to¬†[inhibit](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/inhibit)¬†or discourage one‚Äôs expression of it, while the perception that it is popular tends to have the opposite effect. Developed by German survey and communication researcher¬†Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann in the 1960s and ‚Äô70s, the¬†[spiral](https://www.britannica.com/science/spiral-mathematics)¬†of silence theory more broadly attempts to describe¬†[collective](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/collective)¬†opinion formation and societal¬†[decision making](https://www.britannica.com/topic/decision-making)¬†regarding issues that are controversial or morally loaded.\n\n\u003e Overall, the findings indicate that in the Snowden case, social media did not provide new forums for those who might otherwise remain silent to express their opinions and debate issues. Further, if people thought their friends and followers in social media disagreed with them, they were less likely to say they would state their views on the Snowden-NSA story online and in other contexts, such as gatherings of friends, neighbors, or co-workers. This suggests ==a spiral of silence might spill over from online contexts to in-person contexts==, though our data cannot definitively demonstrate this causation. It also might mean that ==the broad awareness social media users have of their networks might make them more hesitant to speak up because they are especially tuned into the opinions of those around them.==\n\n#### Answer\n- Can you think of other examples where \"voices\" are silenced through design?\n-   How do you think we can break free from this systemic process of silencing?\n\nOutline:\n- Example of voices silenced by design:\n\t- The \"off-line\": marginalized underemployed/unemployed and 'technologically intimidated' groups who lack the financial resources to participate at all in cyberculture (the digital underclass)\n\t- The digital underclass is invisible, except where its movements are tracked by surveillance systems aimed at keeping people in their 'electonic ghettoes'\n- How can we break free of this?\n\t- be aware of the ways social class and cyberculture are interrelated\n\nThe silencing of \"voices\" through design reminded of  my Cultural Studies of Technology class, where we discussed class in cyberculture. According to Alessandro Aurigi and Stephen Graham (1998), there are three groups that make up the \"social architecture of cyberspace\", one of which is the \"off-line\": marginalized underemployed/unemployed and 'technologically intimidated' groups who lack the financial resources to participate at all in cyberculture ‚Äî this makes them the digital underclass. This underclass is invisible to most of the population. However, they are still visible to surveillance systems, who track their movements so that they can kept in their \"electronic ghettoes\"; these are defined by danah boyd as digital spaces in which user population has focused on a given subculture, mirroring social divisions from the physical world. An example of this can be seen in most Filipino schoolchildren. Their main source of wifi comes from either bite-sized internet plans or [*pisonets*](https://restofworld.org/2022/philippines-pisonet-internet-access/). Since every click or minute spent online is costly to them, they're discouraged from exploring the webs and end up staying in familiar spaces; one example being the free data version of Facebook ‚Äî [which is the same as \"The Internet\" for them](https://longreads.com/2018/09/13/facebook-isnt-the-same-as-the-internet-except-when-it-is/). I believe journalism is one way we can break free from this systematic process of silencing. Journalists have the power to elevate these silenced voices on their platforms so that others can become aware of them and the issues they face, whether it be [suffering with terrible internet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeaUPLSa1DY) or [struggling with content moderation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Py_ZJ5q-MFo).\n\n\n## Afrofuturism\n- I was excited to get into \"Afrofuturism: From a Lens to a Portal\" because I thought it would teach me a lot about a movement I've been drawn to for so long. And I was right! I did end up learning a lot. Olu Niyi-Awosusi's piece took me on all kinds of rabbitholes, from afropessimism to solarpunk. Going through all of these was a breeze  because they were naturally embedded in Olu's perspectives as a Black person: their own encounters with Afrofuturist works, the ambivalent feelings they experienced with them, and the insightful realizations that they come to. Being a non-Black outsider, I found their personal exploration of the movement eye-opening. Before reading this essay, I could've said that I knew what Afrofuturism is, having read wiki definitions and relevant works; But I definitely gained a new understanding of the movement after when seeing it from Olu's eyes.\n- Thus, I was surprised to find myself connecting with this piece. One of the lines that struck me the most was the recognition of erasure: \"I began to recognize that we had always been inventing and building and innovating, but our discoveries were crushed into the machinery of a white supremacist and capitalistic culture, obscuring those who didn‚Äôt look like the ones in power.\" As a neurodivergent Southeast Asian woman, I highly related to this realization. When I was younger, I romanticized the idea of living and working in the States because I believed that was where all the innovation happened. As I matured, these rose-colored glasses went away. I'm already surrounded by so much innovation, but it's just not getting the credit it deserves; for instance, in all kinds of industries, from animation to tech, foreign companies outsource to the Philippines so that they can exploit cheap Filipino labor. \n- It sucks to live in a world designed against you. Perhaps this is where the power of aesthetics lies; as said by Olu: \"...[it empowers] us to imagine new futures, to build utopias and to usher in a new world.\" Thanks to this essay, I'm excited to dream again.\n\n\t- I was attracted to both its richness, seen in everything from its diverse color palette to its preoccupation with technoculture, and its underlying spirit of optimism.\n\t- No matter what form an Afrofuturist work takes, it never fails to advocate for a  better futures. \n\t- This in turn inspired me to dream big, wanting to see these hopeful futures come to life.\n\t- However, a part of me dismissed these futures as mere fantasies. Despite how inspiring they were, I believed that they could never work in the real world, which was tainted by systemic oppression. \n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T15:56:56.99613631Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2022-08-23":{"title":"2022-08-23","content":"## Principles and Methods of Teaching\n#education #teaching \n### Understanding Effective Teaching\n\u003e _What is effective teaching? Who are effective teachers? What are factors that affect effective teaching practices?_\n\n\u003e In this course we will treat the word \"teaching\" broadly - most probably most of you would use the typical definition - \"classroom teaching\" - However, as you will learn about soon, as long as some basic elements are present, we can consider a scenario \"teaching\". These elements include, in its most basic form: the¬†**teacher**, the¬†**learner**, and the¬†**matter**¬†to be taught and learned. ==When we broaden our perspective, then this allows us to imagine that many things can be considered teaching== - a coach to a team, a manager to his/her staff, a parent forming a child, etc. However, we will practice the methods of more formal education (lesson planning, facilitating techniques, etc.) You are welcome to use the context you can more easily imagine yourself in.\n\n#### About Teaching\n##### Did the teacher teach?\n\u003e Share about your 2 experiences: one where your teacher¬† surely¬†**\"taught\"**¬†and one where you think your teacher¬†**\"did not teach\"**¬†- no need to mention the name of the teacher you are talking about :) Based on the 2 stories you recalled, how do you currently define/qualify what teaching is? Write a 1-2 sentence description.\n\nI'll compare two classes. Both of them were similar in the sense that they had heavy required readings, which the teacher then discussed in class. In one class, the teacher was mostly reading off bullet point slides. These slides were hard to learn from without context; if you didn't read the reading, they'd seem like nonsense to you. Even if I was interested in the topic, I usually got sleepy during lectures; perhaps because I inherently thought I'd learn nothing from them. Meanwhile, in my other class, I loved the way the teacher designed his slides: they were simple (only one quote/definition) yet eye-catching. You could learn from them even if you didn't get to do the reading. I also appreciated how he constantly encouraged participation in class, making sure all of us gave our opinions on the reading. \n\nOverall, the former class was like a monologue, while the latter class was like a conversation. Based on these experiences, I define teaching as the intentional sharing of knowledge and experience, and I believe that both students and teacher should enjoy partaking in it.\n\n##### What is teaching? (Hirst)\n\u003e To keep in mind:\n\u003e **1. What can be considered as part of the act of teaching? What isn't?**\n\t**2. Do you agree with Hirst's assertions about teaching?**\n\n![[images/Pasted image 20220823122131.png]]\n\n[**Hirst on What is Teaching**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsZTKTS30J4)\n1. **Teaching is a polymorphous activity** \n\t1. *Is teaching an activity?*\n\t2. Polymorphous simply means taking different forms.\n\t3. Teaching can come in different forms too - so maybe unlike other professional activities like baking or engineering - to define teaching based on activity alone would be difficult.\n2. **Something is teaching if the intention is for someone to learn something.**\n\t1. *If it's not a specific activity, how then can we define it? Through its DYNAMICS*\n\t2. In the Ignatian Pedagogical Paradigm, St. Ignatius talks about the same dynamics between the teacher the learner and the truth, or what Hirst might calls something or \"X\".\n\t3. So, something becomes teaching if a teacher intends for learning to happen. \n\t4. One way to describe the intention of teaching is to say that the goal of any teaching is change - a change in belief, attitude or skill.\n3. **Activities of a teacher to bring about learning by someone.**\n\t1. *For us to be able to define teaching, we need to see it.\n\t2. 2 qualifiers:\n\t\t1. That the activities are done in a learning context with a clear intention towards the goal to be learnt.\n\t\t2. A teaching activity should be learner conscious.\n\t\t\t1. ¬†This means that the intention should not just be about the matter to be taught (math, science, history, etc), but should be about intending for learning to happen among learners. \n\t\t\t2. This means that teaching is not a one sided thing - It's not just about performing for an audience, it's about keeping in mind the intended goal for your learners-and when we recognize that the goal is change - it presupposes that each learner has a starting point. \n\t\t\t3. What is that starting point? and what does the journey from point A to point B looks like - considering this is part of teaching.\n\n**Summary of Hirst's ideas:**\n1. Polymorphous activity\n2. Intentional = learning for someone \n3. Activity that intends learning for someone\n\n##### Your working definition\n\n\u003e Based on your reflection on Hirst's article entitled \"What is teaching?\", write your own working definition about what constitutes teaching.\n\u003e 1.) Keep your working definition within 3-5 sentences (you may use English or Filipino). Feel free to also approach this creatively - ex. come up with an analogy and start your definition with \"teaching is like...\" - or get a quote to emphasize what you mean. Feel free to also include an appropriate image to illustrate it.\n\u003e 2.) Apart from your working definition - explain how it aligns with or argues against Hirst's presentation (yes you can contend Hirst, but justify your contention don't just troll :)).\n\n*\"Teachers who inspire know that teaching is like cultivating a garden...those who would have nothing to do with thorns must never attempt to gather flowers.\" ‚Äî Author unknown*\n\nI've always loved seeing teaching as gardening, and Hirst's article confirmed this for me. Your goal is to help your student to grow into the best version of themselves, and accomplishing this requires tireless dedication put into various activities ‚Äî planting the seeds of knowledge, tending to them over time, and pruning any weeds (i.e. blockers, biases, challenges) that may get in the way of growth. It's such a personalized process too; the way you nurture your students depends on their unique mindsets, along with their surrounding environments. Good teachers are like good gardeners in the sense that they know how to tailor to each and every case, ensuring that growth happens no matter what.\n\n## Graphic Design\n#design \n### Basic Elements\n- Point\n\t- Focal points\n- Line\n\t- Leading lines\n- Shape\n\t- Geometric\n\t- Organic\n- Texture\n\t- Implied\n\t- Actual\n- Pattern\n\t- defined by consistent repetition\n\n### Personal Branding Ideas\n- reuse flower web logo (or if im being pabibo i can pixellate it, or redraw it)\n- Make 4 icons of...?

Think of one example each, and in a few sentences, explain to us why you chose these examples. Be more thoughtful and try to go beyond the obvious.\n\n\nFor *Kultura ng Pagdidiwata*, I thought of the *Kadal Tahaw*, a tribal dance performed by the T'boli tribe. The reverence for nature can be seen in both its movements and intention; the dance is inspired by the hopping and flying behavior of the Tahaw bird, and it's done in celebration of good harvest. I chose this example because I consider choreographies as kinesthetic forms of design, and I find the way it pays respect to nature charming.\n\n\nFor *Kultura ng Pag-uukir at Pag-uugma*, I thought of the malong, a colorful woven tube of cloth that's characteristically worn by Muslim communities in Mindanao. It can be worn in a variety of ways, one of which is being worn as a hijab ‚Äî for females who need to follow the Islamic rules of modesty and dress. I chose this example because of how it applies Filipino flavor to a universal religious concept; hijabs are worn all over the world, but are any of them as unique as the malongs in the Philippines?\n\n## GenderIT Asia Pitch \n### Requirements\n- Working title\n- Context of story\n- Your pitch\n- Why this story is important to be told\n- Why you are the best person to tell this story\n- Have you worked on this topic before\n\n### Ideas\n- Female content creators (specifically streamers) are the unpaid care workers of the internet\n- Livestreaming is emotional labor\n\t- https://www.atlantis-press.com/proceedings/mmet-21/125961484\n- Considered cultural + digital labor\n\t- https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Cultural_Labor#:~:text=Cultural%20labour%20deals%20%E2%80%9Cprimarily%20with,(Hesmondhalgh%202013%2C%2020).\n\t- https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Digital_Labor\n- Cyberfeminism\n\t- how can we put this in the 3rd world?\n\t- [Cyberfeminist Art as a Medium of Political Expression: Producing and Communicating a Postcyberfeminist Artwork for Social Change](https://monoskop.org/images/d/d1/Tranta_Lydia_Cyberfeminist_Art_as_a_Medium_of_Political_Expression_Producing_and_Communicating_a_Post-cyberfeminist_Artwork_for_Social_Change_2020.pdf)\n\t- [CyberFeminism: Connectivity, Critique and Creativity](https://monoskop.org/images/e/e7/Hawthorne_Susan_Klein_Renate_eds_Cyberfeminism_Connectivity_Critique_and_Creativity_1999.pdf)\n- [Images in Play: How Filipino Women Co-Create Empowerment in Social Games](https://www.academia.edu/45549664/Images_in_Play_How_Filipino_Women_Co_Create_Empowerment_in_Social_Games_preview_)\n- [Community and Capital: Experiences of Women Game Streamers in Southeast Asia](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/355022623_2_Community_and_Capital_Experiences_of_Women_Game_Streamers_in_Southeast_Asia)\n\t- Cultural labor\n\t- Gaming capital\n- [Cultivating Community: Presentation of Self among Women Game Streamers in Singapore and the Philippines](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/349149148_Cultivating_Community_Presentation_of_Self_among_Women_Game_Streamers_in_Singapore_and_the_Philippines)\n- [Gendering the Labor of Social Media Production](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/58b37319ff7c508925e2d112/t/5a1c0c4d53450a9c54757316/1511787597430/DuffyGenderingLaborSocialMediaProduction2015.pdf)\n- [CULTURAL APPROPRIATIONS OF TECHNICAL CAPITAL: Black women, weblogs, and the digital divide](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1369118X.2010.498897)\n- https://networkcultures.org/_uploads/24.pdf#page=215\n\t- self-authorship\n- Care work\n\t- Work of looking after the physical, psychological, emotional and developmental needs of one or more other people.\n- [Game Streamers‚Äô Practices on Twitch and Management of Well-Being](https://joctec.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Yuetal2021-A.pdf)\n- [Feeling for an Audience: The Gendered Emotional Labor of Video Game Live Streaming](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.14361/dcs-2019-0206/html?lang=en)\n- [The Affective Labour and Performance of Live Streaming on Twitch](https://www.jamiewoodcock.net/blog/the-affective-labour-and-performance-of-live-streaming-on-twitch/)\n\t- A primary element of streamers‚Äô labor is¬†_performance_, much of it invisible and ‚Äì until and unless a broadcaster becomes highly successful ‚Äì unpaid.\n- Geographies of care work\n- https://pop.inquirer.net/118188/the-screen-and-her-how-streams-became-a-source-for-community\n- [User-generated content, free labour and the cultural industries](http://www.ephemerajournal.org/contribution/user-generated-content-free-labour-and-cultural-industries)\n- ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs No Way That You Get Paid to Do the Arts‚Äù: Unpaid Labour Across the Cultural and Creative Life Course\n- https://womenscenterforcreativework.com/unpaid-labor/\n\t- We demand recognition as the creators of culture.

Therefore, if you are to engage in the Hows and Whats of teaching, it would be best to first ask this fundamental question: ==Why teach?==\n\n1. **Why is it that you are considering to become a teacher? What is your \"Why story\"?**\n2. **What do you think has influenced your desire to teach?**\n\n#### Labeling our Whys\n![[images/Pasted image 20220829144244.png]]\n\n\u003e \"**Extrinsic motives**¬†involve aspects¬†**not inherent in the immediate work**, such as salary, status, and working conditions.¬†**Intrinsic motives encompass inherent aspects**, relating to the¬†**meaning of teaching and the passion for teaching**, subject knowledge and expertise.¬†**Altruistic motives**¬†entail¬†**perceptions of teaching as a valuable**¬†and important profession and the desires to support children‚Äôs development and to¬†**make a difference in society**. \" (Bergmark, Landstrom, Manderstedt and Palo, 2018).\n\n**Which type of motivation do you think contributes most to effective teaching?**¬†Spoiler alert: The short answer is not one particular one.\n- What we know from research is that teachers from developing countries often become teachers for more Intrinsic and Altruistic reasons - maybe because they see teaching as a way to uplift the social conditions of citizens of their country.\n- However, research also tells us that often students who join the profession for intrinsic or altruistic reasons leave the teaching profession because of a mismatch with their perception to reality.\n- So, if there isn't one particular best motivation, why does it matter to know yours? or even consider it? Despite the fact that motivation is not necessarily a predictor of effective teaching, ==why you choose to teach often means you have a certain perception about your role as a teacher - and this perception often influences your everyday decisions.==\n\n##### Perceived Roles/Motivation of Teachers\n- **Recreating the Caring School**\n\t- Teacher as role model, guide, helper\n\t- Motivations:\n\t\t- Shaped by positive experience = they want to recreate\n\t\t- Shaped by negative experience = they want to correct\n- **Creating a Desirable (Professional) Life**\n\t- Teacher as a professional\n\t- Motivations:\n\t\t- Job security (v.s. other professions)\n\t\t- Self-development\n\t\t- Influence of the future\n- **Fostering the Upright Human Being**\n\t- Teacher as a reformer\n\t- Motivation:\n\t\t- Making a difference for persons and for society\n- **Forming Valuable Knowledge**\n\t- Teacher as an expert (academic/educationalist/with special knowledge)\n\t- Motivations:\n\t\t- Usefulness of Knowledge\n\t\t- Passion for the subject\n\n**Extra Resources:**\n- [**The Story of the Filipino: Teach for the Philippines**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SppdQHZ-4A)\n- [**EXPLORING TEACHERS‚Äô WHYS: Understanding Motivation Among Teachers in the Philippines**](https://www.seameo-innotech.org/portfolio_page/exploring-teachers-whys-understanding-motivation-among-teachers-in-the-philippines-2/)\n\n\n#### Other \"Teacher Factors\"\n##### \"Teacher Factors\"\n![[images/Pasted image 20220829151128.png]]\n\n1. **Gender**\n\t1. According to research, male teachers are often more dominant, authoritarian (Dunkin, 1987; Winer, 1995 in Cruickshank, et al, 2009) and use more aggressive discipline toward boys (Rodriguez, 2002 in Cruickshank, et al, 2009).\n\t2. While, female teachers more often maintain \"warmer\", more nurturing classrooms (Dunkin, 1987; Winer, 1995 in Cruickshank, et al, 2009).\n\t3. However, despite these differences cited, others also report that neither teacher gender, race or ethnicity seem to affect how much students actually learn (Ehrenberg, Goldhaber \u0026 Brewer, 1995 in Cruickshank, et al, 2009).\n\t4. All this research shows that impressions on teachers based on gender still does exist.¬†_As a learner, do you recognize this? Do you find yourself feeling differently about your teachers, depending on their gender?_\n2. **Age**\n\t1. According to studies, there seems to be difference between novice and experienced teachers in terms of how they approach their work and their ability to adjust in teaching. \n\t2. For example, new teachers are more open to trying things (Barnes, 1987¬†in Cruickshank, et al, 2009) yet tend to be more controlling (Fuller and Bown, 1975 in Cruickshank, et al, 2009). \n\t3. While, more experienced teachers, though not as open to change, are able to adjust their teaching well and be flexible to the needs of the students and learning context (Ainley \u0026 Luntley, 2004 in Cruickshank, et al, 2009).¬†\n\t4. _As a learner, when you compare younger to senior teachers, do you experience the same?_\n3. **Personality**\n\t1. In a research of Zamorski \u0026 Haydn in 2002, students aged 11-15 reported that they thought that these characteristics were most important (here are the top 5):]\n\t\t1. Interacts 'normally' (63%)\n\t\t2. Friendly (63%)\n\t\t3. Enthusiastic (54.3%)\n\t\t4. Sense of Humor (52.2%)\n\t\t5. Lets pupils talk as they work (50%)\n\t2. When we know our \"default\" natural tendency, we know if there is a need to move out of our comfort zone when it is called for.\n\t3. _How about you, what would be your \"default\" personality? What are adjustments that you think you might need to make in some teaching contexts?_\n4. **Beliefs**\n\t1. Sometimes, without us knowing it, we bring these paradigms when we teach, and whether they are true or not, according to research, teachers often act on them (Fang 1996 in Cruickshank, et al, 2009).\n\t2. There are many things that might influence your belief, such as how you were brought up, or the kind of education that you yourself experienced as a learner.\n\t3. Teacher's example:\n\t\t1. When I was starting out as a teacher, I remember telling myself that I didn't want to be like those teachers who spend so much time with their students - I believed that that was not my role - I am not there to be their friend, I am there to teach them something! \n\t\t2. However, after years of teaching, I realized that ==relationships are a prerequisite for successful teaching and learning!== I realized that in classes when I was able to name each student, and where I exerted extra effort to know each one, those were the classes where my students were most engaged.\n\t4. What is important is for teachers to be aware of them, so that they can be aware of situations where they make decisions based on them, even if they are unfounded.\n\t5. _What are your current biases and beliefs? How do you think might they affect your teaching? (the effect isn't always negative)_\n\nApart from personal characteristics, Cruishank, et al also asserts that Experience and Preparation in Education also greatly affects ones teaching.\n\n![[images/Pasted image 20220829153411.png]]\n\n5. **Our Teaching and Learning Preferences**\n\t1. These preferences are often greatly influenced by experiences in the past where you enjoyed being taught.\n\t2. Your preference may be different from what is needed in the learning context and by your learners, so, again, I think what is most helpful is to know your bias- and to know when it's okay or not okay to follow it.¬†\n\t3. _What is your \"biased\" learning preference?_\n6. **Know that whats and hows of teaching**\n\t1. . Although a lot of things are searchable online right now, and arguably, you can learn anything from google and/or youtube, expertise is still an important part of teaching - both the expertise in a subject matter and expertise and experience in actually teaching it.\n\t2. Unfortunately, you can't fake expertise! Your students will know if you \"know your stuff\". \n\t3. One way to appreciate this is to think about this question: Try to compare explaining something to someone about something you are familiar with vs. something that is entirely new to you.\n\t4. _If you are to be a teacher in the future, what subject would you want to teach? How much do you know so far about the Whats and Hows of teaching that subject?_\n\nWe cannot separate the teacher from the teaching because...\n\u003e **\"We teach who we are\" (Parker Palmer)**\n\nThis doesn't mean we should change who we are, but if we are to be teachers, we must be aware of how much who we are actually affects our teaching. For example, since I became a parent, I found myself to be warmer to my students - and also eventually liking the kind of teacher I am now.¬†_So, who is it that you will bring to your teaching?_\n\n\n#### Your favorite teacher\nRecall a teacher who you think was very effective.¬†(Answer each question with a maximum of 5 sentences)\n1. What made you say that he/she was effective? (again, no need to name them, but you can situate where you encountered this teacher)\n2. What did this teacher \"bring\" to the teaching experience?\n3. What do you think were the factors that contributed to his/her effectivity?\n\n\nWhen I think about effective teaching, I can't help but think about one of my dance coaches: Coach Reflex. I've been fortunate to learn from him in multiple ways: taking his P.E. Streetdance class, getting his guidance in the Company of Ateneo Dancers, and going through his personal mentorship program. \n\nI see him as an effective teacher because of how much intention he puts into his teaching. Whenever he teaches, he always makes sure to explain why certain things need to be done; for instance: whenever he facilitates warm-up and conditioning, he explains how the exercises help you become a better dancer, such as avoiding injury. He also adapts his teaching based on the students' background; for example: when I was personally learning breaking from him, he gave me feedback and drills that helped me \"unlearn\" the form I've acquired from years of ballet + contemporary.\n\nHe brings to the teaching experience tons of expertise. He's already proved that he's a great dancer, haivng years of experience competing in various battles. However, good dancers don't necessarily make good teachers, and I believe he's also proven that he's qualified to teach. I see this in how he's constantly taking up initiatives to develop himself as an educator, such as the [Leadership Tools for the Dance Leader](https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/18039387652255529/) program and the Adaptive Design for Learning course.\n\nThe main factors that I believe contributed to his effectivity are his personality, preferences, and beliefs; I'll show how these all work together with an example dear to my heart. A few days after the release of election results, I ranted on Facebook about how useless I felt my college education was, considering that many figures in our government aren't qualified to hold positions of power (it didn't help that most of my family voted for these said figures); when he saw this, he reached out to me to share his personal views. He believes education is valuable because it equip yourself with the tools you need to better yourself and your community regardless of your profession; to him, this impact matters more than letter grades (which is why he isn't fixated on them). He works to uphold the value of dance because of its societal impact (i.e. it pushes narratives, and inspires people in so many ways); thus, he \"pays it forward\" by teaching dance to others, digging deeply into his students. In a nutshell: his approachability, understanding, and passion are what makes him such an effecive teacher to me.\n\n#### Key ideas about teacher factors\n**1. The why of teaching inevitably affects the hows and the whats.**\n_Why a teacher teachers and how they perceive their roles as teachers can affect how they approach the teaching process. Thus, it is important for current and future teachers to be aware of their whys._\n\n**2. Teachers cannot be separated from the teaching.**\n_Your background, your personality, your character, etc. is something that you will inevitably bring to your teaching. What matters is to be aware about how these might help or hurt._\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T15:56:56.99613631Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2022-09-05":{"title":"2022-09-05","content":"## Topic Proposal\n#thesis\n### Guidelines\n-   The proposed¬†**title**¬†of your paper/project\n-   The¬†**type of output**: research, applied research, or creative project\n-   Your¬†**topic**¬†(This is not yet the thesis.

Expounding on this, writer Boo Chanco states: \"[Filipinos] don't have a collective national dream...we don't even have a sense of nationhood...we are very individualistic, focused on family and friends, and at best a collection of regional tribes pretending to be a nation.\" Without imagination, there is no innovation; a country with citizens who can‚Äôt dream will forever be trapped in a status quo ‚Äî one embedded with oppressive systems (e.g. capitalism, colonization, patriarchy). So how can we encourage Filipinos to dream big?\n\t- I've found inspiration in Afrofuturism, a cultural movement that envisions the future through the experience and perspective of African diasporic communities. Having been manifested in various mediums (i.e. literature, music, fashion, etc.), this movement has served as a framework for empowerment and liberation for Black people over the globe; imagining better  ‚Äî and therefore just ‚Äî futures is what empowers them to resist the systems that oppress them until today (e.g. white supremacy). I believe Filipinos, with our centuries-long past of colonization, would benefit from this kind of ideology. What would Filipino Futurism look like? That's what I aim to answer with this thesis.\n\t- The final product would be a virtual exhibition consisting of curated materials that represent Filipino Futurism: artworks, music, articles, etc. These materials must fall under set themes that define this aesthetic; in order to make them understandable to visitors, these themes would be expounded on through a series of long-form essays. Visitors can also contribute their own materials to this exhibition. Basically, this website would act like a glorified Pinterest/Are.na board. I also plan to have an Instagram for promoting this project.\n\t- I see this attempt to define a new aesthetic as an act of collective worldbuilding. I believe Filipinos are fully capable of this, having seen our inclination towards decentralized storytelling; just look at movements like ManilaEncounters, RP612fic, and heck, even the International State College of the Philippines. Why do we constantly seek worldbuilding? Perhaps because the society we live in is so broken; thus, we're always trying to reimagine a better world. So why not work towards creating a \"collective national dream\"?\n- Conceptual underpinnings:\n\t- INFORMATION DESIGN: aesthetics, UX/UI design, \n\t- COMPUTER SCIENCE: futurism (technological aspect), web development, database design\n\n### Notes Dump\n\u003e This workshop will harness the power of collaborative imagination in our feminist communities by envisioning a distant feminist future. World building is a design-thinking tool which is used often to create sci-fi, fiction, and fantasy narratives in film, video games, and literature.  \nFirst we use design thinking activities to facilitate creative visualization and begin to define the rules of our imagined world. Then we will use hands-on construction of various artifacts from our created world and the stories that have captivated our attention.  \nWhat do shoes look like in our feminist future? How about currency? The creation of tangible artifacts brings the details of our created world to life.","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T15:56:56.99613631Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2022-09-06":{"title":"2022-09-06","content":"## Principles and Methods of Teaching\n#education #teaching \n### About Learners\n#### On being a learner\n\u003e One of the best ways to put yourself in the disposition to reflect on what your future learners might bring, is to reflect on your own experience as a learner first. Let's not look too far into the past. In this short exercise, i'd like you to share about your current experiences as an online distance learner, in this time of the pandemic.\n\u003e Based on your experience of this shift to online learning, what are some realizations you've had about yourself as a learner? What are situations/personal characteristics that have affected your readiness and capacity to learn? Give 1 concrete example of this from the past year.\n\n#### Considering diversity\n- Do we design our teaching based on sameness or diversity?\n- When you teach, and aim to teach well, one key consideration is to ==understand who your learners are== and what this means in terms of ==their readiness and capacity to learn.==\n- _What are characteristics that often affect a students' ability to learn? What are things that we might consider in preparing to teach learners?_\n\n##### Diversity of Learners lecture\n- Diversity in the **Context** of Learners\n\t- Family\n\t- Socio-economic Status\n\t\t- \"experiences\" outside school\n\t\t- E.G. most public school students haven't gone to museums\n\t- Sexual Preference\n\t- Developmental Differences\n\t\t- high school v.s. college student brains\n\t\t- [How Youth Learn: Ned's GR8 8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_BskcXTqpM)\n\t- Aptitudes\n\t- Interest\n\t- Personality/Temperament\n\t\t- Ways of thinking, behaving, \u0026 reacting (e.g. mood, activity, distractability, etc.)\n\t\t- Self-discipline\n\t- Gender\n\t- Learning Styles\n\t- Culture: \n\t\t- West v.s. East - how they perceive authority (see Yang Liu infographics)\n- Go from teaching a **class** to ==teaching **people**==\n\n#### Considering \"Priors\"\n- Apart from learners' inherent characteristics and current background. Another important consideration is a learner's prior knowledge and experience. \n- What a learner already knows and have previously experienced very much affects their readiness to learn new skills or concepts.\n- The subjects that we find most difficult to learn are those that are new or unfamiliar to us. To skirt around this issue, teachers use relatable stories and analogies.\n\t- E.G. Plato's Allegory of the Cave\n- https://www.aft.org/periodical/american-educator/spring-2006/how-knowledge-helps\n\n\u003e Here's a teaching challenge for you!\n\u003e \n\u003e 1. Think about a concept or skill that you would want to teach about in the future. It could be any topic.\n\u003e 2. Identify the specific group of students who you envision to be your learners(college students, kinder students, teenagers).\n\u003e 3. Then, think about a prior knowledge or experience that you can connect to it to help your students grasp the skill/concept easier. (Prior doesn't always mean past - it could mean the present to - something they are currently experiencing. Ex. Most of your courses have probably been making connections with the pandemic).¬†\n\u003e 4. **Share your answers below. Keep your answer to a maximum of 5 sentences.**\n\n\n- Skill I want to teach: Basic fitness, specifically the 6 essential functional movements (i.e. squat, lunge, hinge, push, pull, and carry)\n- Specific group: college students\n- Prior knowledge: cues based on experiences they are all capable of imagining (e.g. bracing your core = imagine being punched in the gut)\n\nIn the future, I want to teach basic fitness, specifically the six foundational movement patterns: squat, lunge, hinge, push, pull, and carry; I envision my learners to be college students (think P.E. instructor vibes). I'm aware that many students start college with 0 fitness experience, which may make it difficult for them to understand cues for correcting their form. In order for them to fully understand these cues, I'd compare them to sensations they are capable of imagining, even if they haven't experienced them. For example: if I'm teaching my students how to brace their core while they do these movements, I'd tell them to imagine being punched in the gut; I believe that anyone can imagine this because of the natural reactive responses we all have. If there are still some students who have difficulties understanding this cue, I'd make them do exercises to help them learn this (e.g. deadbugs).\n\n#### Key ideas about learner factors\n1. **Aim to teach learners not just students.**\n\t1. It's quite intentional that in the module I tried to consistently refer to students as learners - this is because sometimes we have the notion that being \"students\" can be a passive role - to just attend class.\n\t2. However, when we remind ourselves that our students' roles are to be \"learners\", it reminds us of their active role in the teaching and learning process.\n\t3. This means that in as much as you contribute to teaching, learners also contribute greatly to the learning.\n2. **Teach for equity, not just equality.**\n\t1. In planning your teaching, hopefully you do not just plan to teach all your learners, but every learner - to consider not just what is the same among your students, but your learner's individual differences as well.\n3. **It's about empathy.**\n\t1. Since the goal of teaching is to facilitate learning, teachers need to be able to empathize with students - to see things from their perspective. \n\t2. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYMyqiLVcPs\u0026feature=emb_title\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T15:56:56.99613631Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2022-09-12":{"title":"2022-09-12","content":"## Thesis\n#thesis\n### Advisor Notes\n#### 9/12/22\n##### Feedback\n1.

This was definitely enlightening for me. \n![[images/Pasted image 20220913101258.png]]\n\n### Culture ingested\n\u003e In understanding Philippine design, it is important to familiarize yourself with the idea of ==cultural hybridity (mestizaje)==. We are a very culturally diverse nation, and had endured several colonial regimes. This has a significant impact on the subjectivity that we form, both as individuals and as a people. In this module, we look at a creative field that is rich but also often overlooked: gastronomy.\n\n*To read: Doreen Fernandez, ‚ÄúCulture Ingested: Notes on the Indigenization of Food‚Äù*\n\n\u003e Whether on your own, or in your family or circle of friends, have you observed any particular food-related quirks or traditions which makes you feel at home? Think about it (or ask around a bit): how did this start and what conditions gave rise to it?\n\nTradition: I noticed that most of the women in my family (both sides) go overboard when it comes to feeding me and my siblings at home. My mom constantly overorders food whenever we go out, even in spite of complaints (because she's a careless spender). My tita always buys way too much snacks (e.g. chips and chocolates) whenever she goes grocery shopping, despite my requests to tone it down (it amazes me how she's a doctor yet advocates for so much processed foods). My lola frequently sends homemade delicacies to our house, my favorite of hers being strawberries and cream. To be honest, I've hated (and perhaps still hate) how obsessed all of them seemed to be with food; as someone trying to lose weight, I thought that these traditions were detrimental to me. I couldn't help thinking: \"Why are they always trying to sabotage my progress?\"\n\nOf course, I know they mean well. Now, I understand that gift-giving is one of their main love languages, and they show this through enthusiastically feeding me and my siblings. Reflecting on their lives, I can assume that this came to be because of how they grew up. My lola came from a life of poverty, where her next meal wasn't always guaranteed. My aunt's parents' managed and grew a popular restaurant, so she grew up valuing food (after all, it physically and financially sustained her family). My mom had distant parents: her mother was the neglectful type, while her father was oceans away, working as an OFW; despite the physical distance, he made up for it through constant providing, whether it be tuition or balikbayan boxes (much of which was filled with treats). Despite the differences in their upbringings, they all ended up appreciating food.

These artifacts can also be sorted and filtered through thanks to having tags like: type/format, date of release, and present characteristics (from concrete design elements/styles like maximalism to abstract thematic concepts). This archive will also come with a form that will allow anyone to contribute to it. \n- A glossary section that explains and expounds on the aforementioned characteristics. Each item here will also come with its own page, where one can learn about its defintion, history, related terms \u0026 theories, and example artifacts (which will come from the archive). \n- An editorial section consisting of a series of articles that aim to dissect how local memes reflect aspects of Filipino culture, from the values we've grown up with to the current state of our politics. These articles will allow viewers to understand the significant role of digital folklore in our lives.\n- Facebook and Instagram accounts that will be used as the archive's promotional platforms.

In online learning, it's not easy to just \"wing it\" (you know, those teachers who can just get by with their often entertaining personality and presence). \n\t- In online learning, \"learning\" - rightly so, is put to forefront. \n- Therefore, teachers, the polymorphous bunch that we are, need to evolve, not just to be performers and facilitators in front of students, but to be ==designers and guides== as well - both requiring one crucial activity: planning.\n- We will reflect broadly about how teachers plan - and we will zoom into the paradigm we will use for this course called backward design.\n\n#### Planning forward\n##### Activity\nA.¬†**Imagine that you are planning to teach**¬†any¬†of the following to a¬†grade school student.¬†\n\n‚åõ¬†**In 3 minutes**¬†(ideally setup a timer and don‚Äôt go beyond 3 minutes), ‚Äúplan‚Äù to teach about this (no need to do any research on how to do it-just go ahead and do what you think would be right). Jot down notes or questions in a sheet of paper or in a digital notebook.\n\n**Ready?**¬†Start when you are, then continue to read on to reflect on your experience.\n\n**B. Look at your plan with notes and questions.**¬†Take note of the following (you can mark them with 1, 2, and 3)\n\n1.) Notes/questions about¬†**what to teach about this**¬†(topics, facts, etc)\n\n2.) Notes/questions about¬†**how to teach this**¬†(activities, strategies, etc)\n\n3.) Notes/questions about¬†**why teach this**¬†(Application of this topic in real life, when will students use this, etc.)\n\nDo you have more of 1, 2 or 3?\n\n##### Reflection\n- When we plan to teach, there is often a tendency to focus on # 1 and/or #2. \n- Teachers, who are often experts in a certain discipline, would often jump into planning the content (what) and those who have trained to be teachers, the strategies (how). \n- This results to a \"teaching model\" that is commonly known as ==\"teach, then test\"== - teach the content, then¬†come up with a test to check if students have learned it.\n\n\u003e Is this an ideal way of planning? Why? or why not? (After all, the considerations of # 1(topics) and #2(activities/strategies) really make up most of what we do as teachers, aren't they?)¬†What do you think? What do you think is the advantage and/or disadvantage of this way of planning?\n\n#### Planning backwards\n**Moving beyond teach, then test.**\n-  If you didn't see anything wrong with the planning to \"teach, then test\" model then you are not alone. This is still a prevalent planning model in the profession.¬†\n- However, doing so sometimes leaves effective learning to chance because this type of planning ==leaves out a key player in the teaching process-the learner! ==\n- There is much wisdom in Hirst‚Äôs assertion that¬†**it is the learner that does the learning**¬†after all! ¬†This means that if we want to effectively teach, we have to first begin with the learner-or in other words, to ask questions about # 3. \n- Why should learners learn ‚Äúthis‚Äù? Think about it. Technically, you can plan out topics and activities (most specially if you just plan to present the content) without considering the learners at all!¬†\n- But, why can this be a challenge? ==If in the first place, why learners need to learn what you want them to learn is unclear, they will not naturally want to learn. ==\n- One way to understand this is to look back at our \"informal\" learning experiences (things we learned outside school) - remember some of the first few things you learned as a human being - how to walk, how to talk, etc. There was no curriculum that asked you to learn it - you learned these things because of something you yourself wanted to do (to walk, to talk and communicate with others, etc). \n\nThis leads us to consider an alternative way of planning called **backward design.** So, what is backward design? [Here's a short video to introduce you to the concept](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xzi2cm9WTg).\n\n![[images/Pasted image 20220915233553.png]]\n- ‚ÄúBackward Design‚Äù (See Figure 1.1), first introduced by Ralph Tyler in 1948 and popularly adapted by Wiggins and McTighe (proponents of the Understanding by Design Framework), reverses how you typically plan for your teaching. In more \"traditional\" teaching, planning begins with # 3 (teach-learning experiences and instruction), then # 2 (test-find evidence of learning).\n- While in backward design, you begin with the desired results and acceptable evidence first, BEFORE planning activities and strategies to be part of instruction. In the anecdote above, it is beginning by \"planning the destination\". Put in another way, this means that in this model, we begin with \"Why learners need to learn this?\" (desired results) first. This is very much aligned with Hirst's definition of teaching, where the objective of any teaching is for learners to learn \"x\" - if we clearly determine what \"x\" is, then whatever \"teaching\" we end up doing will be designed to gravitate towards it.\n- [Get a deeper overview of the process through this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbKx_tG99ho)\n- [Read more about backwards design in this whitepaper](https://files.ascd.org/staticfiles/ascd/pdf/siteASCD/publications/UbD_WhitePaper0312.pdf)\n\n\u003e 1. How do you think will planning backwards affect teaching and learning? Think about the subject area that you want to teach in the future - of you were to plan backwards, what do you think does this entail? What will be easy to do? What do you think will be challenging?\n\u003e 2. Recall your experiences as a learner - can you give an example where if the teacher planned backwards, it could have potentially made your experience as a learner better?\n\nBackwards planning makes teaching and learning more intentional, which in turn increases effectiveness. This is because it considers the learner's needs in the design of their educational experience, which makes them more inclined to engaging in it.\n\nI want to teach a movement practice in the future, whether it be a dance style or basic fitness. Planning backwards would entail for me the following: determining what successful learning outcomes look like (could be concrete, such as memorizing cetain vocabulary moves, or more abstract, like learning the value of discipline) and adapting my teachings to my students' needs (e.g. background experience, learning disabilities). The former would be easy for me thanks to years of experience (which allows me to be certain about what needs to be learned), while the latter would be difficult for me because it would require a lot of effort to get to know my students (since each one is unique).\n\nReflecting on my experiences as learner makes me think of my old dance studio, where I was a part of the elite team. The artistic director introduced a cross-training class into our training program, and I was really excited to try this. However, after a few sessions, I ended up feeling really disappointed; class sessions were only a hour long (while dance classes usually last from 90 minutes to 2 hours), and whenever I was following the exercises, I felt like I was just going through the motions, not knowing how they'd help me as a dancer. The class didn't feel effective to me at all, and it didn't seem worth the extra cost.\n\nI would've had a better learning experience if the teacher planned backwards. She could've done this by determining the students' goals and needs (because each dancer has a unique body and mind), creating our exercise program based on these, then making the objectives of this program explicit to us. For instance, she could've introduced back strengthening exercises as a way to increase the height of our *arabesques*; along with this, she also could've provided regressions and progressions of this exercise, so that students can adapt based on their back flexibility.\n\n#### Key ideas about backward design\n**1. Teach well by design, not by accident.**\n_Planning is an essential part of the teaching process. Think of it as the \"behind the scenes\" of teaching, or the rolling credits at the end of watching a great movie. Effective teachers plan well, they don't just \"show up\"._\n\n**2. Begin with the end in mind.**¬†\n_If you are familiar with this catchphrase popularized by Stephen Covey, this is really what backward design is. Being clear with what you desire for your learners is an essential first step for any good teaching and effective learning. Put another way, ask first: What is this for? What is the desired result?_\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T15:56:56.99613631Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2022-09-16":{"title":"2022-09-16","content":"## Philippine Design\n#design #culture #Filipino \n\n\u003e Each of the abovementioned living cultures manifests itself in design.

These have always been a staple Filipino accessory, advocated by everyone from trendy Instagram jewelry shops to paraphernalia vendors outside churches. I believe that the longstanding influence of these medals shows the scale of our devotion.

It's so prevalent in our culture that Filipinos from all social classes have encountered this machine; after all, how can a Filipino house party or family reunion is complete without singing?

Without reviewing your syllabus documents, remember a course you have taken in the past (1st Quarter to past few years).¬†\n\u003e \n\u003e 1. Identify the course and think about what you gained/learned from the course. (it's up to you as to how you phrase this)\n\u003e 2. Then, recall what the course aimed for (the course learning objectives) - how similar or different were your gains/learnings from what was \"on paper\"/set by the course originally?\n\n#### What are objectives for?\nAccording to Borich, there are three main reasons why educators should write objectives.\n1. Translate standards into **observable** classroom accomplishments.\n\t2. Teaching challenge 1: What is a **long-term goal** for a subject you want to teach?\n\t\t1. E.G. Long-term goal: decision making to address climate change\n\t\t\t1. A grade school student may not be able to do as much as an adult. However, a learning objective you can have is articulating what this looks like in your student's setting/context. One observable classroom accomplishment: throwing trash in the proper trash bin\n2. Inform learners of what is **expected**.\n\t1. Teaching challenge 2: What is an example of an **action** or **decision** that you think you can see students make or do, related to this long-term goal?\n\t\t1. E.G. Based on the observable classroom accomplishment, we can expect grade school students to identify the various categories of trash (e.g. types of items like plastic, what not to recycle)\n3. **Inform** and **frame** instructional activities.\n\t1. Teaching challenge 3: Based on the **action/s** and or **decisions** that you would like your students to be able to make, what do they need to **know** or be able to do?\n\t2. E.G. Aside from categories of trash, students may also need to learn about the process of recycling and ecology (non-biodegradable v.s. biodegradable). Instructional activities they can do based on these are going on field trips to see recycling plants or forests; in these places, they can be toured around by guides who explain to them what conditions are like.\n\nLearning objectives lead us to...\n- Clarity\n- Transparency\n- Depth\n- Relevance\n\n#### The anatomy of an objective\nSo, how do we actually write an objective? We'll start by clarifying what it is NOT. Then, we'll break down what goes into a learning objective statement.\n**Here's a quick exercise**¬†_(try to answer the question below - just in your head).¬†**Let's say these are statements for early grades students****:**_\n![[images/Pasted image 20220921014023.png]]\n\nThe right answer is number 3 - Students will practice the multiplication tables. How is this statement different from the other two?\n\n![[images/Pasted image 20220921014107.png]]\n\nStatement 1 and 2 point to an ==\"end state\"== or what we've started to call a ==\"desired result\"==, while # 3 is just a statement that describes a learning activity. \n\nSince the sentences seem alike, you'll have to remind yourself of the litmus test - ==is it a means or an end for the target learner?== the example above was for early grades, which helps us assume that they could not do # 1 and 2 yet. \n\nHowever, if say we change the context to the upper grades (ex. Gr5-7), # 1 and 2 seem so elementary and could be learning activities that lead to a more complex objective. This leads us to the first key idea about learning objectives: ==**üîë Learning objectives should describe a desired result, not just an activity.**==\n\n##### Writing Effective Objectives\n- Let's reverse engineer this statement: **\"Students should be able to write an essay on a given topic without grammatical errors.\"** What do you think makes this a good objective?\n- Key components:\n\t- ==**Behavioral:** ==observable and measurable; identifies the **performance** and the **product**\n\t\t- E.G. \"write an essay\"\n\t- Identify the learning ==**conditions**==\n\t\t- E.G. \"on a given topic\"\n\t- Identify the ==**criterion**==\n\t\t- Criterion: set of standards you want student to achieve\n\t\t- Standards can be of a particular discipline (e.g. writing), or time?\n\t\t- There are some times when learning objectives don't identify the criterion because what teachers do in these instances is talk about the criterion in terms of **grading**\n\n##### Moore's \"Classroom Teaching Skills\"\nClarifying the difference between conditions and criterion\n![[images/Pasted image 20220921015505.png]]\n\n##### Lesson Cont.\nIn the video and excerpt above, I touched on the following key ideas:\n\n**üîë**¬†**Learning objectives should articulate the¬†==target behavior.==¬†What is the verb that describes what you want your students to be able to do after the class or course?**\n\n**üîë**¬†**Learning objectives should articulate¬†the¬†==condition and criterion.== What is the context by which you hope for learners to do the behavior? What are the standards that you want them to achieve?**\n\n\u003e Come up with 3 learning objectives for a subject area/year level that you would like to teach in in the future. In your post:\n\u003e \n\u003e 1. Identify the subject area and year level\n\u003e 2. 3 learning objectives - label the parts (behavior, condition, criterion)\n\n\n- Subject Area: Cultural Studies of Contemporary Technology (interdisciplinary elective)\n- Year Level: 4th Year College\n- 3 learning objectives:\n\t- Students should be able to demonstrate a sufficient understanding of the interactions between culture and technology *(behavior)* through closed-book *(condition)* tests consisted of short answers and essays *(criterion)* - APPLY\n\t- Utilizing critical theory *(condition)*, students should be able to analyze contemporary technologies *(behavior)* through written long-form essays *(criterion)* - ANALYZE\n\t- Students should be able to critique timely and relevant sociotechnical issues *(behavior)* rooted in the Philippine postcolonial experience  *(condition)* through creative group presentations *(criterion)* - EVALUATE\n\nCourse learning outcomes:\n- Analyze various contemporary technologies of recent times as subjects of serious inquiry and further cultural study\n- Demonstrate a deeper understanding of the diverse and profound interactions occurring  between culture and technology\n- Competently utilize critical theory in considering the intersection of their own experience and examples of contemporary technologies\n\n\n#### Making your objectives bloom\n- Apart from articulating clear aims/goals for your course, learning objectives can also be a powerful mechanism to make sure that learning is deepened in your class or course.\n- ¬†Remember our earlier discussion forum when you said that teachers who \"didn't teach\" were those who just asked you to memorize some facts? There is a reason why, as a learner, you felt this way! \n- It's probably because you were not led to deepen or apply your thinking - much of which you can plan to happen early on, by coming up with learning objectives using a common framework called \"Bloom's Taxonomy\".\n\n##### How to write learning objectives using Bloom's Taxonomy\n- created by educational psychologist Benjamin Bloom\n- Not all learning objectives are created equal. By determining the level by which a learning objective is in, we can make sure that ur learning objectives help deepen a students' understanding and ability.\n\n\n![[images/Pasted image 20220921020340.png]]\n\n**Three Types of Learning**\n1. Cognitive: mental skills (Knowledge)\n2.  Affective: growth in feelings or emotional areas (Attitude)\n3.  Psychomotor: manual or physical skills (Skills)\n\n##### Lesson Cont.\n\n\u003e 1. In the learning objectives in the previous discussion forum, did you write more lower order objectives (remember, understand, apply) or higher order objectives (analyze, evaluate, create)?\n\u003e 2. Any questions about coming up with learning objectives?\n\n#### Key ideas about learning objectives\n**1. Objectives allow you to see learning.**\n_If the objective of teaching is for students to learn something, then ==it starts with articulating what you want to see.== Of course you do have long-term goals that you might not be able to realistically see in the time you have with your students - and though it is important to think of those, you'll have to articulate how you want to see those goals at this moment - these are what objectives are._\n\n**2. Objectives allow you to set standards.**\n_Often, learning is about a change in your students' knowledge, skills and attitude - what we know from research is that ==if this change just happens in the lower order stages, it is less likely to be retained and to be actually used in real life situations in the future.== This is why we consult Bloom. :)_\n\n## PH Design\n#design #culture #Filipino \n- Pancit as culture...pancit as design\n- Design isn't just aesthetics... we have to think about its roots...\n- There are 100+ kinds of pancit!\n- We have the privilege to do research\n- Food also counts as information!

The research will engage the term ‚Äúdigital literacy‚Äù and investigate narrative structures, relevant aesthetics (forms), the medium representation) and sharing culture (remediation and following). The rules of sharing, production and consumption and the influences of platforms will become important ways to study this topic.\n- Mythologies will be explored in terms of local embeddedness, digital versatility and their global cultural contexts\n- We will be attentive to the evolution of storytelling from an oral practice, to a written one, to film and online distributed illustrations, to video. We will focus on specific story-telling forms within the online communities we‚Äôve chosen as cases, and explore the reasoning behind their expressions of narratives. The investigation of different levels of visualisation will lead us to a thick description of and theoretical insights concerning changing narratives, genres, presentation and representational styles across different digital communities, from words to memes.\n\n##### Figures\n\u003e Who speaks the loudest, and what are they speaking about?\n\n- This track focuses on the figures (i.e. individual characters, affinity groups, influencers, bloggers, trolls, states, autonomous bots) that populate the Internet and the vernacular expression through which they become heard. I\n- While the affordances and norms of global Internet culture have encouraged the proliferation of some folkloric figures, we will consider the ==hard and soft infrastructure (i.e. physical servers, content filters, protocols)== and ==soft power (i.e. diverse net cultures, paralanguages and Internet lexicon, user rituals)== that have stimulated uniquely SEA figures to emerge since the year 2000.\n- On a larger scale, this track will investigate the insidious subversive frivolity of everyday folklore to understand ==how mythology becomes established as corporate and national ideology== and, at a theoretical level, will explore the relationship between online and offline, physical and digital, living and the continuities that exist between pre- and post-Internet figures.\n\n##### Layers\n\u003e How are real and digital worlds layered?\n\n\n##### Rumour\n\u003e Is the internet post-truth?\n\n\n### The Internet in Asia through Singapore\n\u003e The Internet or, as these authors argue, Internets (plural) in Asia are composed of cables and exchanges, protocols and firewalls, regulations and other legal devices, making them subject to investment and governance strategies, as well as treaties and court cases. But they are also composed of figures, layers, stories, and rumors. These latter descriptors provide a heuristic framework of social features that, together with metaphors from folklore, provide analytic tools for understanding the diversity, conflicts, competitions, and disengagements of the patchwork of Internet development across Asia. The authors further argue that Singapore provides an exceptionally valuable comparative site from which to explore these features. The Ô¨Årst part of this article lays out some of the comparative features, and the second part turns to the four themes or heuristics of Ô¨Ågures, layers, stories, and rumors, developed through an STS research cluster at the Asia Research Institute and Tembusu College, both at the National University of Singapore.\n\n- Studies the Internets of Singapore through 4 coference themes\n- The themes are also grounded in two key arguments: that Internets are formsof life and that Internets reÔ¨Çect and¬†produce¬†narratives.\n- The use of the¬†plural noun Internets here is deliberate, corresponding to the overallargument that no single, monolithic Internet exists in Asia (or elsewhere) despite twonation-states (India and China) accounting for the majority of the regional population.\n- To think about Internets not (only) as networks, technologies, infrastructure, imag-inations, or mediums but in terms of layers, stories ,Ô¨Ågures, and rumors provides a¬†jumping-off point and¬†a set of new¬†perspectives that have developed¬†from a ground-upcollaboration of Internet-studying scholars in Singapore. These themes can coexist,can be contiguous, and are consistent with a position that there is no one Internet inAsia.\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T15:56:57.0001364Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2022-09-26":{"title":"2022-09-26","content":"## Philippine Design\n#design #culture #Filipino \n\n- Food to package: \n\t- Lucky Me!

Although there is much to be said and learned about assessment design, in this course, we will limit ourselves to the bare minimum and will focus on understanding the different types of assessments and how they can be more closely aligned with your learning objectives. As imagery, we will refer to assessments as \"evidences of learning\"¬†üîç, and refer to the saying\n\n![[images/Pasted image 20221002212659.png]]\n\n\u003e After all, as we learned in Hirst, learning will always be the goal of good teaching.¬†==_What are different types of evidence that we can have students produce? What are the opportunities and limitations of each type of assessment?_==\n\n#### Why assess?\n¬†When we talk about assessments in education, there are usually three main purposes: ==Diagnostic, Formative and Summative.== For the purpose of this course, we will on summative assessments, but it would be good for you to know the difference among these three.\n\n- **Reasons for assessments:**\n\t- To **gauge** students' learning context\n\t- To **promote** learning\n\t- To **evaluate** learning\n- Assessments are like pins on a map; they serve as markers that help both teachers and students know that they're actually learning\n- **Types of assessments:**\n\t- **Diagnostic:** What do you know so far? What can you do so far?\n\t- **Formative:** What have you learned so far? Are you getting it?\n\t- **Summative:** Can you use what you learned?\n\n![[images/Pasted image 20221002214039.png]]\n\n#### Designing Authentic Assessments\n##### Module\nNow that we have some sense of the purpose of coming up with assessments, let's jump right into the design process. As each step is presented below, I invite you to simulate it with the lesson you are designing.\n\n1. üéØ¬†**STEP 1: Retrieve your ==learning objectives**==¬†-¬†_What is the \"change\" you want to see?\n\t1. Well written learning objectives make it easier for you to actually come up with the assessment for it. Sometimes the objectives themselves begin to describe the actual assessment to be done. \n\t2. For example, in my media and technology course, one of my learning objectives are as follows: \"Students should be able to curate and create media¬†**(behavior)**¬†to aid in teaching a particular subject matter¬†**(condition)**, abiding by instructional design principles¬†**(criterion)**\" - in this case, the main task for my actual assessment is already my learning objective. \n\t3. If your learning objectives currently do not \"spell out\" what the assessment will be like yet, that's okay! We'll do that in STEP 2.\n2. üñºÔ∏è¬†¬†**STEP 2: Choose the ==form==**¬†-¬†_How can I \"see\" the learning objective?_¬†_What is the most appropriate evidence that students can produce in their context?_\n\t1. After reviewing your objective, the next step is to envision it being attained in the context of your learner. This is where the level of your learning objective comes into play-remember Bloom's taxonomy?\n\t2. **ASSESSING HIGHER LEVEL OBJECTIVES**¬†through¬†**AUTHENTIC ASSESSMENTS**\n\t\t1. If your learning objective is stated on the higher levels (ex. analyze, evaluate, create), you will probably want to design authentic assessments. ==Authentic assessments approximate the¬†**application**¬†of the knowledge/skills you want students to attain and use in a real-life context.== When you look at the verbs under these higher order learning objectives, they describe activities that involve more complex thinking, a mix of skills and decision making. It usually involves the creation of a product, the conduct of a performance, or a set of justified decisions that students will need to make given a realistic situation/scenario.\n\t\t2. [Assessing What Matters Most: Developing Authentic Performance Tasks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zvFNR8WL3g)\n\t\t\t1. Apply and use in meaningful ways\n\t\t\t2. Teachnig is like coachnig\n\t\t\t3. Work to improve\n\t\t\t4. Teachers as coaches\n\t\t\t5. Teaching for understanding and transfer\n\t\t3. The tricky part is what we identify as \"authentic\" - and ==the answer to this cannot be removed from the context of your students.== What might be an authentic scenario for a college student might be different for a grade school student (you actually already started to think about this - remember our previous exercise where I asked you to think about the long-term goal for your subject?). \n\t\t4. One of my favorite examples to illustrate this is the [TV show Masterchef](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E86-RJe7mfA)!  What makes Masterchef authentic?\n\t\t\t1. Apart from them really doing the actual cooking, and not just participating in a quiz bee about cooking, the challenges presented call for an application of their cooking skills in realistic scenarios - and one characteristic of a realistic scenario is that it's \"Messy\" - it can be sometimes unpredictable, there is¬†no one right answer,¬†and it often involves more¬†complex decision making. These are the same ingredientes (pun intended) that make up an authentic assessment.\n\t\t\t2. Let's use another example - let's say you are teaching basic addition to a grade 1 student. It's great if students can count aloud from 1-20 and could answer a number of drills you throw at them, but wouldn't it be more authentic if they could actually use their math skills to help their parents compute the grocery, or to figure out how to save up for a toy that they want to buy?\n\t3. Authentic assessments¬†**aim for APPLICATION NOW not just APPLICATION LATER**.\n\t\t1. I remember asking a few teachers before about why we needed to learn what they were asking us to learn about, and more often than not the answer I got was \"you'll use it in the future!\" For a grade school kid, \"you'll use it it in the future\" did not sound like a compelling reason to study the subject matter - but just the same, I studied to get an A on a test, and to just forget it immediately after. Is this an experience you can relate to as well? If your answer is yes, your teacher came from an ==\"Application later\" paradigm== - they believed that students just need to \"get through school\" - anyway, they will find good use for what they have learned \"later on\". The problem with this, as the example illustrates, is ==the lack of relevance that students feel, and that more often than not, the learning that happens is just good for passing a test.==\n\t\t2. In an authentic assessment we design ways to approximate the real life applications of what you aim for them to learn. So, how do we come up with these situations. One helpful tool is called the GRASPS model.\n\t\t\t1. **G**oal ‚Äî challenge or problem\n\t\t\t2. **R**ole or Responsibility\n\t\t\t3. **A**udience\n\t\t\t4. **S**ituation or Scenario \n\t\t\t5. **P**roduct or Performance\n\t\t\t6. **S**tandards ‚Äî Expectations\n3. **Reminder:**¬†At this point, you may be thinking that authentic assessments should always be a project. The answer is: No. ==What makes it authentic is the task, not the format!== This means that a paper and pen essay could be authentic, if the situation set-up follows GRASPS.\n\t1. _Ex. In a persuasive writing class for college students, an authentic written assessment might sound like this: You have been in charge of a new national committee called the COMELEC Youth (Role). Your goal is to convince young people like you to vote wisely in the upcoming 2022 Philippine Presidential Elections (Goal). As part of your role, you have been asked to give a 20 minute speech to 1000 young leaders from all over the Philippines (Audience), in the opening convention (Situation). Write a compelling script (Product, Standards-assuming what makes something compelling has been learned in this class) for this speech._\n\n\u003e Come up with a possible authentic assessment for the learning objective you thought of in the previous exercise. If you came up with a lower order thinking objective, try to come up with a higher level one. Share about your authentic assessment idea below. In doing so:\n\u003e \n\u003e 1. Identify the subject area and year level\n\u003e 2. State the learning objective/s.\n\u003e 3. Describe the idea for an authentic assessment using GRASPS as a guide.

Optional: You may want to add a picture or video clip to help us picture what you have in mind.\n\n##### Task\n###### Learning Objectives\n**Feedback from Sir. for last exercise**\n- Students should be able to demonstrate a sufficient understanding of the interactions between culture and technology¬†_(behavior)_¬†through closed-book¬†_(condition)_¬†tests consisting of short answers and essays¬†_(criterion -¬†==this still sounds like a condition==) \n\t- To develop a criterion for this, ask: What is the degree I want my students to get to in terms of the skill of demonstrating an understanding of interactions between culture and technology?

One way to distinguish is to say that:_\n\u003e **_Criterion is the ==\"degree, to what extent, how\"== of the behavior_**\n\u003e **_Condition is the ==\"context, situation, givens, when\"== of the behavior_**\n\n\n\u003e E.G.

This study about what Dutch people think about the future and about technology shows, among other things, that they are generally positive about technology and science, but more gloomy when it comes to the future of society. People find it difficult to think about the (distant) future and spend little time reflecting on it. It is precisely the current speed and complexity of global changes that ensures a revaluation of the historical context when the world was still manageable. Another outcome is that the respondents are relatively down-to-earth. Representations of the future that are vastly different from our current state of affairs can count on little support. Dutch realism is also reflected in a long list of technologies that the respondents would rather not see developed.\n\n1 What do Dutch people think about the future in general? 2 What do Dutch people think about the possible general future courses of technology? 3 What type of futures do Dutch people desire? 4 How do Dutch people think about the possible future course of safety, robotics, digitization, and biotechnology? 5 Do the opinions of the Dutch people on the future and technology vary across sociodemographic characteristics?\n\nhttps://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0953946818807462#:~:text=By%20technological%20imaginary%2C%20I%20mean,one's%20future%20to%20be%20like.\n\u003e Here I draw on Charles Taylor‚Äôs definition of social imaginary, by which he means ‚Äòthe ways people ‚Äúimagine‚Äù their social existence, how they fit together with others, how things go on between them and their fellows, the expectations that are normally met, and the deeper normative notions and images that underlie these expectations‚Äô.[12](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0953946818807462#fn12-0953946818807462)¬†By technological imaginary, I mean the ways that technics shapes the possibility for how things fit together, how purpose and meaning shape what one imagines one‚Äôs future to be like.\n\n\nhttps://sts.hks.harvard.edu/research/platforms/imaginaries/imaginaries-faqs/\n\u003e **Q:¬† Can individuals have imaginaries?**\n\u003e A:¬† Not in the sense intended by this term. Individuals may conceive and communicate¬†[persuasive visions of the future](https://www.genome.gov/11007524), but these are not appropriately called imaginaries unless they take hold in other minds, and people start working to convert¬†[what is imagined into actuality](https://sts.hks.harvard.edu/research/platforms/imaginaries/iii.proj/imaginaries-publications/#jasanoff_kim). Individuals who lead and shape institutions or social movements may be especially effective creators of sociotechnical imaginaries.\n\n- Science fiction = sociotehchnical imaginaries...\n\nhttps://studenttheses.uu.nl/handle/20.500.12932/1259\n\u003e Modern-day democracies are investigating how to deal with long term problems that do not incentivize enough action in the present to prevent great problems in the future, like climate change. One possible solution could be that alternative, positive futures are to be collectively imagined, different from dystopian futures that can be painted by climate models or scientific predictions. Imagining these desirable futures has been proven to be difficult: some have argued that we are currently amid a crisis of the imagination. Intriguingly, cultural artefacts could aid in stimulating imaginaries of alternative futures. More specifically, science and climate fiction could be specifically suited for this purpose. The question that was therefore asked in this research is: to what extent can (science) fiction can stimulate policy makers to think of alternative futures? Ten policy makers participated in this study, who used science and climate fiction to create imaginaries of future worlds. Results revealed that most policymakers found that science and climate fiction stimulated them to think of alternative futures. However, most policymakers found that science fiction was not the most useful tool to create imaginaries for a policy setting. Recommendations are therefore made that future thinking is policy settings is stimulated, but that improvement are made for using methods to do this.\n\n- Interview\n\t- 1st part\n\t\t- describe work activities\n\t\t- Is futures thinking central to your work? any specific project?\n\t\t- How do they envision the future?\n\t- 2nd part\n\t\t- describe what science fiction they knew\n\t\t- most impactful ones were assumed to have most influence on their development\n\t\t- imagine that the two science fiction artefacts they chose were to become reality in 10 years\n\t\t- Consequently, they were asked to describe what this world would look like by making use of the Miro board.

This is why we tend to consider technology a good thing or, at least, a neutral thing.\nhttps://www.slideshare.net/JorgeMLucena/black-mirror-13-the-entire-history-of-you\n- background? or significance?\n\n\u003e we therefore ask what are the sociotechnical imaginaries of VR? How do these sociotechnical imaginaries frame the future(s) of VR? And finally, what kind of world views do these imaginaries bring about? In using sociotechnical imaginaries as a lens, we reveal how the future is framed within the market thus stymieing any real alternatives to the current ideological order of late capitalism and furthermore, how VR, as a case study of emergent technology, serves to invisibilise the power asymmetries which are required for that order.\nhttps://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0267257X.2022.2112610\n\n\n\u003e Similarly, speculative design aims to shape people's visions of possible futures and mobilize affect in order to construct alternative futures imagined by the designers. Speculative design can thus contest, create, and enact sociotechnical imaginaries [[96](https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3313831.3376515#bib96)]. Just as sociotechnical imaginaries can be used to look both to the future and the past, we can similarly use speculative design to re-orient toward the past.\n\nhttps://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3313831.3376515\n\n\u003e I spend a lot of time talking about futures. I'm a firm believer, like some of your earlier speakers, that the world essentially runs on narratives. It runs on stories, particularly stories about the future.\n\u003e At the World Economic Forum, I led the work on¬†[The Fourth Industrial Revolution](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/01/the-fourth-industrial-revolution-what-it-means-and-how-to-respond/), focusing on how emerging technologies could disrupt industries, labour markets, societies and governments, and how technology can be used to empower communities to create a human-centred future. The story about this was very consciously related to the idea of values, and credited to this idea of technology as a public good. We tried to create a¬†[socio-technological imaginary](http://sts.hks.harvard.edu/research/platforms/imaginaries/imaginaries-faqs/)¬†by articulating an entire narrative and way of talking about the subject.\n- technological narratives: https://www.unicef.org/globalinsight/stories/technology-and-power-narratives-times-uncertainty\n\n\n\u003e The imaginaries mentioned by S√∂derstr√∂m et al. refer to ‚Äústorytelling ideological constructs,‚Äù mostly used by corporations like Google (Shaw and Graham¬†[2017](https://link.springer.com.oca.rizal.library.remotexs.co/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-94-024-1202-4_23-1#ref-CR91 \"Shaw J, Graham M (2017), to convey a positive discourse of social prosperity and technological advancement.

One of the major repercussions is the ability of those citizens to produce and hack information about their own urban environment (Foth et al.¬†[2015](https://link.springer.com.oca.rizal.library.remotexs.co/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-94-024-1202-4_23-1#ref-CR36 \"Foth M, Brynskov M, Ojala T (eds) (2015) Citizen‚Äôs right to the digital city: urban interfaces, activism, and placemaking.

In other words, facilitated by the technologies present in the so-called algorithmic culture, urban residents can become city co-producers who are imagining, communicating, and shaping the city they desire.\n\nhttps://link.springer.com.oca.rizal.library.remotexs.co/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-94-024-1202-4_23-1\n\n\u003e Evocative imaginaries of the digital have been flourishing parallel with very prosaic, everyday actions of users by screens, keyboards, and other interfaces. Imaginaries definitely offer potential for cultural analysis, even if they are ever imperfect, provisional, and mutable. This chapter explains how imaginaries evoking ungraspable and enchanting dimensions of digitisation have been related to everyday practice and the mundane. It briefly outlines the concept of imaginaries in a way useful for cultural analysis and empirical studies of digitisation. The chapter introduce the concept of mundanisation, in order to explain how technological systems, at times imagined as ungraspable, enchanting, and sublime are transmuted into the commonplace while being enmeshed in people's everyday practices. Mundanisation is the process through which the ungraspable is ignored and how imaginary frontiers are overlooked. The chapter also discusses the interplay between evocation of imaginaries and mundanisation with illustrations that explains the relationship between imaginaries, mundanisation, and digitisation.\nhttps://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781315627731-4/imperfect-imaginaries-robert-willim\n\n\u003e The legitimacy of business education and its impact on society have been debated in the context of the economic and climate crises, with curricula, learning spaces and pedagogy being the main targets of criticism. Somehow, the COVID-19 pandemic has increased that pressure and added social inequalities to the debate. Thus, this paper proposes an exercise of imagining what management education and society will be like in 2050. Using speculative imagination, we narrate three imaginaries - Techno Futurist, Sustained¬†[Inequalities](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/inequality \"Learn more about Inequalities from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages\")¬†and Eco-utopia - built upon the perspective of the students of a sustainability programme at an elite Brazilian business school. Throughout the construction of the imaginaries' narratives, we found dilemmas and contradictions that alert us that there is no clear path to an emancipatory future and that, unfortunately, the tendency is to reproduce neoliberal ideology and managerialism. Furthermore, the lack of diversity of teachers and students, a direct consequence of business schools‚Äô admission and funding, can hinder new imaginaries. We conclude by inviting business schools to include imagination as a critical exercise for students, so that they can organise outside of ‚Äúbusiness as usual‚Äù, open up alternative futures, and cope with the uncertainties that surround us.\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016328722001446?casa_token=FmB8gSxeCNUAAAAA:F4D-8RGgi2zKPGpILFGsWSCD4E0wX6X0qTXmnX1odPikInxuLfNe1ORCqQ74ueLak720bjD5KAfc\n\n- possible titles\n\t- Filipinofuturism\n\t- CyberPilipinas\n\t- Kawingan\n\t- Konneksyon\n\t- Pagkakakonekta\n\t- Kawingan; Kinabukasan\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T15:56:57.0001364Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2022-10-14":{"title":"2022-10-14","content":"## Thesis\n#thesis\n\u003e Critical Technocultural Discourse Analysis (CTDA) is a multimodal analytic technique for the investigation of Internet and digital phenomena, artifacts, and culture. It integrates an analysis of the technological artifact and user discourse, framed by cultural theory, to unpack semiotic and material connections between form, function, belief, and meaning of information and communication technologies (ICTs). CTDA requires the incorporation of critical theory‚Äîcritical race, feminism, queer theory, and so on‚Äîto incorporate the epistemological standpoint of underserved ICT users so as to avoid deficit-based models of underrepresented populations‚Äô technology use. This article describes in detail the formulation and execution of the technique, using the author‚Äôs research on Black Twitter as an exemplar.

The question is, do you need to have an authentic assessment every day of your class? \n- Answer: No. As previously emphasized, ==since tasks given in authentic assessments are complex, it usually entails using several knowledge and skills - this means that it takes some time for a learner to be able to successfully do it.== \n- For example, in this class, the lesson plan is an authentic assessment which I will have you work on - but as you can see in the module, I need to ask you to do some exercises first, that will lead to the building of the skills you'll need for your actual lesson plan. \n- ==These skill-building or knowledge-testing exercises are often referred to as \"traditional assessments\" (because, in terms of practice, most assessments still look like this - it is only recently that teachers have become more conscious of making sure that authentic assessments are done as well).==\n\n##### Authentic v.s. Traditional Assessments\n- As opposed to authentic assessments, traditional assessments are less \"messy\" and complex. They often have a particular right answer (or a set of right answers). This is often the case because typically, ==traditional assessments evaluate a students' capacity to do the subset skills necessary to build towards and authentic skill.==\n- For example, in a Physical Education Class, an example of a traditional assessment for basketball might be a shooting practical test - where the teacher can evaluate a player's capacity to shoot accurately, as well as their shooting form, etc. These (accuracy, form) are necessary skills that they will need for a more authentic task (ex. playing in a 3 on 3 game). \n- Although it is ideal for assessments to be authentic, ==traditional assessments still play a crucial role since they give teachers some feedback about the subset skills they want students to be able to gain== (ex. if a student cannot dribble, it will affect his/her ability to play in an actual basketball game). \n- Common types of traditional assessments include:\n\t- üìù¬†**STANDARDIZED TESTS:** These exams are taken by cohorts of students from different schools. They are often designed by an external body -ex. entrance exams, national achievement tests,etc.\n\t- **üìù**üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è**TEACHER-MADE TESTS OR ACTIVITIES:** This is the most common category - common examples are graded quizzes with various question types and exercises. Test items or tasks are often specifically designed to evaluate a students' ability to do a particular skill or comprehend a particular concept. Tests and exercises can measure a students' ability across bloom's taxonomy through carefully designing the types of questions or tasks.\n\t- [Review this article on the different question types](https://canvas.unl.edu/courses/97691/pages/traditional-assessment-types)\n\n\u003e Try to come up with a traditional assessment for your learning objective/s. It can either be an activity or a test.\n\u003e 1. Identify the year level and subject area\n\u003e 2. Share about your traditional assessment idea:\n\u003e \t- If you decide to come up with an¬†**activity**¬†-state the learning objective, describe the activity and explain what you will check or how you will gauge a students' success. Ex. I will ask students to write 3 complete sentences to introduce themselves. I will check for proper capitalization.¬†\n\u003e \t- If you decide to come up with a test - state the learning objective, give at least 2 examples of test questions (any question type) and explain how each question will help you determine what a student has learned.\n\n#### The Assessment Litmus Tests\nApart from the forms that the assessment takes and how much it aligned with your learning objectives, another key consideration in designing assessments is to ensure its validity and reliability.\n\n##### Validity \n- To put it simply,¬†**validity is the extent by which the assessment will be able to tell if a student has really met the objectives**/has learned what you wanted the students to learn. \n- For example, asking a question in a test about something that was never discussed or touched on in class invalidates that test question! When questions or tasks are given in an assessment, it should be clear that this is something you expect for them to be able to know or do, because of what they learned. This can be a common mistake in test making because the teacher is often an expert in a subject area, and might end up asking questions based on what they know not what has actually been taught. \n- Another version of this is a common mistake in coming up with authentic assessments. Have you ever been asked to post a multimedia project where the basis of your grade is the number of likes? Unless this is a class on social media marketing, this is usually an invalid way of assessing! Why? because the skill of getting people to like a post is often not connected to the actual skill being assessed in projects like this (ex. an infographic for a math class, or a video for a science class).\n- One helpful litmus test in checking for assessment validity is to ask this: **Can your students do this without having learned what you want them to learn?**¬†(ex. can they come up with a viral video without attending your math class?) - if the answer is yes, then you might be coming up with an invalid assessment. At the end of the day, the assessment should primarily¬†**provide evidence of your learning objectives.**\n\n##### Reliability\n- On the other hand, reliability is the extent by which your assessment can provide reliable results/measure what you want to measure¬†**consistently**. \n- For example, if you came up with a multimedia project (ex. make a video), will it favor those students who are more technologically and artistically inclined? Will that get in the way of objectively being able to tell if your students met the objectives? When you designed and gave a test across different sections, were the range of results different when compared? (In your assessment course, you will look into this more deeply - we won't get into this too much in this course).\n- One helpful litmus test in checking for assessment reliability is to ask this: **Are there factors in the assessment that might disadvantage other students?**¬†How can I minimize the chances that this affects their performance?\n\nIn ensuring that your assessments are valid and reliable, you are able to ensure that the data you get from your students' work truly give feedback about their learning - after all, that is really one of its main purposes.\n\n#### Key ideas about aligning assessments\n1. **Ideally, assessments provide evidence not just of knowledge and skills, but of application.** _Authentic assessments are great ways to make sure that you provide opportunities to actually try their skills now, not just later._\n2. **Assessments should always be anchored on objectives.** _What you assess and how you assess should provide evidence of your objectives being met. As a teacher, it is for you to see if students have really learned._\n\n### Designing Learning: Instruction\n#### Selecting Learning Instruction\n##### Module 3 Overview\n\u003e One of the most important factors in how interesting teachers are to their students is their use of one key behavior:¬†**instructional variety**. In a study of experienced and inexperienced teachers (Emmer, Evertson, \u0026 Anderson, 1980; Emmer \u0026 Evertson, 2016; Evertson \u0026 Emmer, 2016),¬†**experienced teachers who showed flexibility and variety in their instructional strategies were found to be more interesting, easier to listen to, and more engaging**¬†than inexperienced teachers who had no knowledge of alternative teaching strategies.\n\u003e \n\u003e **Knowledge of a variety of instructional strategies and the flexibility to change them both within and among lessons are two of the greatest assets a teacher can have**. It is unlikely that any other key behavior, however well executed, will have the same effect as variety and flexibility in capturing the interest and attention of your students.\n\u003e \n\u003e (Borich, 2017)\n\n##### Park your experiences at the door\n- As learners, we've been used to the \"receiving end\" of the teaching that happens. In the previous exercise, you probably had your own reasons for being able to say that those strategies/learning activities were effective. \n- However, although there is something to be drawn from our experiences, ==basing \"good teaching\" on experience alone is not necessarily sufficient. In fact, we are often \"limited\" by the experiences we've had.== \n- For example, if in the schools you've attended the lecture was the prevalent method of teaching, then you could bring that bias with you as a teacher - either positively (lectures are most effective) or negatively (lectures are boring and ineffective - if you haven't experienced a lot of good lectures). This bias can then get in the way of accommodating new methods and strategies - so, we must be ==\"bias conscious\".==\n- Therefore, as you go through this module, I invite you to ==\"park your experiences at the door\".== Leave them behind for a bit - we will draw from them when necessary, but I invite you to be open to listening to the experiences of other educators and research as we uncover a variety of teaching methods, even if sometimes they might challenge your own paradigms and perceptions.\n\n##### How people learn: Intending to ACE\n- Although we will not have time to delve deeply into what it takes to learn and the science behind it, I'd like to give you a brief overview of 3 things that we know from research about what teachers can do to lead to effective learning. \n- When designing learning experiences, here's one way to make sure you ACE your design (note: although we created this video with online learning in mind, the principles are very much applicable to any modality). As you watch the video begin to think of examples of how you, as a learner, may have experienced ACE in your own classes (online or otherwise).\n- [**Designing for Online Learning**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP3l628WZQo)\n- The short video above provides 3 brief tips about how to effectively design for learning, each of them, grounded on educational research and the learning sciences. In this course, we will treat them as ==principles or goals for our instructional activities== - that when we design instructional activities, no matter what specific strategy you will plan to use, we will keep these three instructional intentions in mind (clue: in the lesson plan format, you can use them to explain your instructional intention). Here are a few more things to expound on each of them.\n\n1. **üßçACTIVATE FROM CONTEXT**\n\t1. This first principle is grounded on one of the key findings we know about learning from Cognitive Science. That is - ==the role of prior knowledge and experience.== Tapping into a learner's prior knowledge and experience is an effective way to lead to learning because from a neuroscience perspective, what you are actually doing here as a teacher is ==activating your learner's neurons for you to connect to.==\n\t2. Notice how in our modules I would often begin with asking you to recall or remember a past experience? - this is the reason for it! Think about it. Imagine explaining something new to someone - it will often be easier for them to understand if you begin not with the new information, but with ==what they already know or have experienced. ==This is also why sometimes memes or pop culture references work when included in the teaching process.¬†\n\t3. **Think about the topic you have in mind for your lesson plan. What can you activate from your learners' context?**\n2. üêô¬†**CONNECT TO CONTENT**\n\t1. This second principle is, again, grounded on another key idea from Cognitive Science - that is, that ==the process of learning is \"active\" not \"passive\".== Sitting through the lecture and listening, without actively thinking about what you're hearing doesn't immediately contribute to learning! It's not like teachers pour knowledge onto a student's head! (This analogy about teaching is a common misconception). The actual \"learning\" happening in your students' head is ==an active process of a learner \"processing\" the stimulus presented and¬†**allowing that to modify their perception or actions.**==\n\t2. This means that another instructional intention, if we are to teach effectively, is to make sure that you ==create opportunities not just to present content but for students to connect to it.== This is why teachers who ask a lot of ==good questions== really get students to learn. \n\t3. E.G. I remember Philo classes with Dr. Calasanz - he would ask very simple questions like \"Paano kung walang Diyos?\", and get us to really grapple with it, even after the class period.¬†\n\t4. **Think about the topic you have in mind for your lesson plan. What can you ask students to do or think about that can get them to actively connect, and not just passively absorb your lesson?**\n3. üèÅ¬†**EVALUATE TO VALIDATE**\n\t1. Finally, this third principle is anchored on one of the findings of the learning sciences that ==\"retrieval practice\" is an essential part of the learning process.== This principle is very much aligned with a common saying that you might have heard before: \"If you don't use it, you'll lose it\". What we know about effective learning is that ==the act of remembering and using something you just learned== is actually one of the most powerful ways to really solidify what you are learning. \n\t3. For example (and feel free to try this out), one of the findings from research on this area said that when you are preparing for a test, instead of reviewing and rereading your notes, ==spend more time setting it aside and trying to explain it over and over to yourself.== According to research, the latter is a more effective way to learn. \n\t4. This means that as teachers, we should design experiences not just for students to \"acquire\" new content or skills, but several experiences to practice and apply it as well.¬† (Wait, isn't this already the assessment?! - yes, you're right, but apart from the assessment that often aims to measure what has been learned, it would help to have several opportunities to produce evidences of learning in the learning activities/in instruction, even if it is not something that will part of their grade.¬†\n\t5. **Think about the topic you have in mind for your lesson plan. What are practice activities that students can do?**\n\n- These will be the three main instructional intentions we will bring to our design of instructional activities. At the onset, you may look at them as a way to sequence your activities - starting with an activity to activate from context, then connect to content and to evaluate to validate. Yes, that's one approach, and as you will learn in the next part of this module, very much aligned to a method called \"Direct Instruction\". \n- However, ==this need not be treated linearly.== Some methods might just focus on one or two of them, and that's okay! ==What matters is your instructional intention is clear.==\n\n##### Aiming for Objectives\n\nApart from having clear instructional intentions, another consideration in choosing the right method or strategy is to look back at your goals or your learning objectives.\n\n\u003e \"Just as the carpenter, electrician, and plumber must select the proper tool for a specific task, you must select the proper instructional strategy for a specific learning outcome (Borich, 2017)\"\n\nIn the previous module, one way by which we started to categorise our goals/learning objectives is by using Bloom's Taxonomy. Wherein, the upper part of the taxonomy involved learning objectives that fell in the category \"higher order thinking\" while objectives that target the lower part of the taxonomy were those of \"lower order thinking\".\n\n###### **Higher order**¬†vs.¬†**Lower Order thinking Objectives**\n- According to Borich, one way we can distinguish these two broad categories of objectives is to say that\"\n\t- what needs to be taught to meet lower order objectives (Understand and Remember) are often¬†**\"==facts, rules and action sequences== (or what Borich refers to as Type 1 tasks)\"\n\t- while what needs to be taught to meet higher order objectives (Apply, Create, Evaluate, Analyze) are¬†**\"==concepts, patterns and relationships== (or what Borich refers to as Type 2 tasks) \".**¬†¬†\n- Let's compare these two sets of learning objectives:\n![[images/Pasted image 20221020100208.png]]\n\n\u003e 1. Based on the examples above, what do you think makes Type 1 objectives different from Type 2 objectives?¬†\n\u003e 2. How do you think will teaching Type 1 objectives be different form Type 2 objectives?\n\n###### Answer\n1. Based on the examples above, what do you think makes Type 1 objectives different from Type 2 objectives?¬†\n\nWhat makes Type 2 objectives different from Type 1 objectives is that they're attached to **context**. They're not only asking for the demonstration of a skill (as seen in Type 1 objectives, which asks for isolated demonstrations), but they're also asking for the **application** of this skill in a certain situation. In the examples provided, this can be seen in the following: using knowledge of photosynthesis in assessing places, using a lay-up shot in a basketball game, and using mindfulness of different belief systems to be a more respectful person.\n\n\n2. **How do you think will teaching Type 1 objectives be different from Type 2 objectives?**\n\nI think that teaching Type 1 objectives is more teacher-centered, meaning that it requires that the teacher must first deliver the information. Meanwhile, teaching Type 2 objectives is more student-centered, meaning that it requires that the student must be able to fully process that information; in order to do this, they must be able of connecting the learnings to their own context.\n\n##### Matching methods with objectives\n**What differentiates type 1 from type 2 objectives? What types of methods are more appropriate for each one?** Let's revisit the table from the previous activity.\n![[images/Pasted image 20221020100208.png]]\n\n-   **Type 1 objectives are often more \"simple\"**¬†\n\t- By simple, we mean it involves less steps, less prior knowledge and experience, and less complex decisions or synthesis of ideas and skills. This means that they can efficiently be taught by ==\"telling\" or \"showing\". ==\n\t- For example, in the reverse engineer an activity we did in class, skills like \"how to tie your shoelace\" is a topic we can imagine easily telling students about or demonstrating to students.¬† After all, for these types of objectives, the goal is for them to be able to repeat what you do or understand what you explain. \n\t- The same goes for the sample type 1 objectives in the table above (Borich, 2017)\n-   **Type 2 objectives are often more \"open ended\"**¬†\n\t- Since there is often a greater level of analysis and decision making in type 2 objectives, there usually isn't one clear cut \"right answer\". \n\t- For example, in the table above, using the appropriate type of shot may be different for one student or another, and greatly depends on the context of the game. \n\t- Although you can teach students strategies like using a lay-up shot when they are close to the basket, and a jumpshot when they are far from the basket, etc., them actually being able to decide on when to take the shot and what shot to take is something they cannot learn just by hearing you tell them about it. \n\t- In the same way, you can teach students grammatical rules, but them apply it accurately when explaining a concept of writing a narrative is something that is honed through practice. \n\t- Teaching Type 2 objectives often ==entail providing opportunities for students to do problem solving.== (Borich, 2017)\n\n##### Key ideas about selecting instruction\n1. **Focus on the learning first, then the teaching.**\n\t1. A part of you might be thinking: \"This is all great, but can't we just go straight to the strategies?\" - this is actually a common mistake of educators. \n\t2. Often, we get excited to think about the strategies and ways by which we want to teach our discipline (let's gamify it! --but why?) without first thinking of how these activities will contribute to student learning. \n\t3. If we want to aim for learning to happen, ==we must begin with the learning first, before the teaching.==\n2. **Use the right tool for the right purpose.**\n\t1. As mentioned in the beginning of this module, the teaching methods you will learn next will be like tools in your teaching toolbox. \n\t2. However, you must know when and how to use the right tool for the right purpose. \n\t3. Using a wrench to fasten a screw might work but might not be the most efficient or effective way to do it.\n\n#### Direct Instruction\n##### What is Direct Instruction?\nTeaching with¬†**Structure, Sequence and Scaffolding**\n![[images/Pasted image 20221020115054.png]]\n- For type 1 objectives, one of the most efficient instructional methods is called Direct Instruction.\n- Direct instruction, or what is sometimes referred to as explicit instruction, is a¬†**teacher-centered strategy**¬†in which the ==teacher is the main provider of information== (In light of our current context of online distance learning, \"teacher\" here can be replaced with software/module or LMS-more than the persona teaching, it's how students are learning in this method that differentiates it from others - where this is a more \"direct\" approach). \n- Since the goal of type 1 objectives is for ==learners to be able to do or know what a teacher is currently be able to do or understand==, then a ==direct instruction approach is often most efficient.==¬†_This module page is an example of direct instruction, since as you read through this text and watch the media I ask you to, the intention is to help you describe what direct instruction is for yourself._¬†¬†\n- One of the most common experiences we've probably had of this method, as a learner, is the ==lecture or teacher presentation==, but what is it that goes on in planning for this method that can make it an effective teaching method? One way to characterize this method is to refer to 3 key words:¬†**Structure, Sequence and Scaffolding.**¬†Let's unpack each of these characteristics.\n\n###### üñºÔ∏è¬†Structure\n- One of the key principles in using direct instruction is that it ==presumes a structured set of activities and presentation of the lesson.== The way a lesson presentation is structured in direct instruction allows several students to follow in a lesson, whether it be a straight lecture or a set of activities guided by the teacher. \n- This is probably why this approach is one of the most common methods used - since the ==ratio of teacher to students in most classrooms is probably 1:15== (teacher:student) and above. Another context that has kept this as one of the most adopted methods is time - that in a lot of formal teaching scenarios, ==teachers have to work with a limited contact time with their students== (Even in online learning, we can only assume that you will spend¬†_N_¬†number of hours on a module).¬†\n- In the direct instruction model, facts, rules, and action sequences are presented to students in the most direct way possible. At first, this usually takes a ==presentation and recitation format with explanations, examples, and opportunities for practice and feedback provided by the teacher.==\n- [Watch this short video to see what a typical direct instruction structure looks like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJJkkUPC_yM)\n\n###### üñºÔ∏è¬†Structure\n- The video above presented a sample structure that is common to direct instruction. If you do a quick search about direct instruction lesson plans, you might feel a little overwhelmed with the variety of different ways they look like. \n- However, there are a few key common parts, despite them being called differently. For the purpose of our course, we will follow this simplified structure:\n\n1. **PREPARE**\n\t1. In this first part of the direct instruction method, you will need to prepare students to take in the new information you want them to learn. I chose the word \"prepare\" because I think that this presupposes that more often than not, in a formal education setting, a curriculum is already set for students (It's not as if every subject they take is an elective). \n\t2. Therefore, it is important to begin by ==establishing relevance==, to hopefully motivate learners to take on the new information to be presented. Typically, there are 2 things that you would like to be able to do here:\n\t\t1. **Inform the learners of the learning objectives.**\n\t\t\t1. State your objectives in a clear and understandable fashion. If you are in a physical classroom, it is often good practice to ==write down your objectives and keep them visible== on a board so you can refer back to it. \n\t\t\t2. The challenge here is that ==sometimes younger learners have different levels of reading comprehension== - one interesting strategy I saw done in the early grades is that for some teachers, they actually ask students to rewrite the learning objectives in their own words.\n\t\t2. **Activate prior knowledge and/or experience.**\n\t\t\t1. In part 1, we called this \"Activate from Context\". Here, you can ==refer to a students' related prior knowledge/experience about the topic. ==\n\t\t\t2. For example, before introducing the concept of photosynthesis, you might ask students to draw plants, or in a Philosophy of Religion Class, an instructor might simply ask \"What do you think is religion?\". Apart from the cognitive advantages of activating from context, this also allows you as a teacher to get a ==\"read of the room\" or to understand where your students are at the moment== - what do you they already know/what are their misconceptions at this point, etc.\n\t\t\t3. One common strategy, most specially in basic education is ==the use of a KWL chart==, where students fill in the blanks for K and W in the beginning of a lesson. Sometimes, in the preparation stage, teachers also try to gain students' attention through presenting something from pop culture (something that students have previously encountered).\n\n![[images/Pasted image 20221020121553.png]]\n\n2. **PRESENT**¬†AND¬†**PROCESS**\n\t1. The next phase is the \"meat\" of the lesson, wherein ==teachers present stimulus material and where new knowledge or skills are introduced.== This comes in many forms, the most common being a presentation/demonstration. \n\t2. The short video lectures i've posted in the course, and this text you are reading now are examples of this phase. Here, the instructional intention is for you to hopefully¬†not just understand the information presented, but also process it. \n\t3. A common critique of the direct instruction method is the way this phase is implemented by educators - for example, if you recall teachers who might have \"powerpointed you to death\" (who just stood in front reading from slides), this is representative of the common critique against direct instruction - ==the lack of involvement of the students== (Remember how we established in the previous module that learning is actually an active process).¬†\n\t4. For direct instruction to be effective though teachers should not just dominate the presentation - but should ==ideally involve the students in the knowledge building process.==¬†¬†So, how do we make sure that you do this effectively? Here are some tips:\n\t\t1. **Chunk your content**\n\t\t\t1. HOW MUCH LEARNING TIME: \n\t\t\t\t1. In¬†_Brain Rules,_¬†Author John Medina reminds us that ==our brains naturally look for something else to do every 10 minutes!== This means that when you hit the 10 minute mark, the temptation to lose focus becomes very real for students! \n\t\t\t\t2. One way to address this is to ==stop giving new information/demonstrating new skills after the 10 minute mark== - what often helps is to ==insert a discussion or short practice activity==, or even just an ==open forum== for students to discuss what they have gained from the past 10 minutes. (note: this is the reason why in the modules of this course, i've broken the topics down into several pages and discussion forums, rather than one very long one).\n\t\t\t2. HOW MUCH TO BE LEARNED AT A TIME:\n\t\t\t\t1. Have you noticed how most effective speakers would say something like, \"there are three things about ___?\". \n\t\t\t\t2. There is actually some science behind this! According to Dr. Barbara Oakley, ==our brain's working memory has the capacity to take on 4 new things at a time.== This means that if you are introducing something entirely new to your learners, already keep in mind that after the 4th new concept, your learners may need a break, or time to process. \n\t\t\t\t3. The operative word here is \"new\" - ==the more prior knowledge you have about something, the less it will feel \"new\" to you== (and consequently, will cause less of a cognitive load to process). \n\t\t\t\t4. Remember our earlier discussion about student diversity and how your students' socio-economic status might get in the way? Imagine how different it would be to teach students Science if you have a student who has never been to a museum vs. those who have.\n\t\t\t\t5. Sometimes the pause you insert in between \"inputs\" can be a simple \"temperature check\". A common way this is done is for teachers to ask students to bring three pieces of paper (red, yellow and green), and occasionally, students will be asked to raise a colored sheet of paper depending on how they are doing (Trivia: in zoom, the go faster and slow down prompts which participants can click serves as a good substitute of this).\n\t\t\t\t6. ![[images/Pasted image 20221020122736.png]]\n\t\t2. **Scaffolding**\n\t\t\t1. Another common educational term that can help you plan the present and process phase is the term \"scaffolding\". You might have previously learned about this in your Psych 101 class, but scaffolding, as it also appropriately refers to ==the multi-stage structure often used in construction, presupposed that knowledge and skills actually build on each other. ==\n\t\t\t2. Recognizing this, one helpful thinking tool is to think about how your target knowledge/skills could be broken down (remember our reverse engineering activity?).\n\t\t\t3. A common strategy for scaffolding is the¬†**I do, we do, you do**¬†method (although it is often used in elementary education, I think it can easily be translated to teaching older learners). [Here's a brief demonstration of this strategy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOMF06TJAO4) In this example, a graphic organizer was used to help scaffold the learning process - ==graphic organizers and worksheets are helpful tools for scaffolding.== The KWL chart above can serve the same purpose.\n\t\t\t4. No matter how you present content, a good guiding principle is always to go back to the instructional intention which is for your learners to ==\"connect to content\", not just to absorb content.== This way, you will always be thinking of how you can make sure that the learning experience is not a passive but an active one.\n\n3. **PRACTICE**\n\t1. Finally, the third phase is when you \"evaluate to validate\". This is the \"you do\" part of the lesson, where ==a teacher often gives exercises for students to work on or questions to reflect on and discuss. ==\n\t2. The goal here is two fold: for ==\"retrieval practice\" ==to happen (which we know contributes cognitively), and for teachers to ==receive feedback on student learning== (after all, this is the goal, according to Hirst). \n\t3. Some critiques of this approach would often say that there is often no time left to do this in a class period. Because of this, strategies such as asking students to work on an \"exit ticket\" has been developed. These are short, quick exercises that students can do towards the end of a session. [Here's a brief demonstration about exit tickets.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWUxFSXEsC8)\n\n##### Teaching Challenge: Direct Instruction\n\u003e Here's a design challenge for you. Identify a type 1 objective for the lesson you are planning. Then, think about how you can use direct instruction to teach it. In your post below include the following:\n\u003e \n\u003e 1.) Identify the year level and topic (ex. Grade 9: Introduction to Algebra)\n\u003e 2.) Identify One (1) Type 1 objective (ex. Students should be able to define accurately what a variable is.)\n\u003e 3.) Propose a set of instructional activities for a 60 minute face to face class period using the Direct Instruction Method. Complete the three phases (Prepare, Present and Process, Practice). For each activity, also provide the estimated time.\n\n###### Answer\n**Year Level and Topic:** Cultural Studies of Contemporary Technology for 4th Year College students\n\n**Type 1 Objective:** Utilizing critical theory, students should be able to analyze contemporary technologies.\n\n**Direct Instruction Example:**\n1. PREPARE\n\t1. Present the learning objectives for the session.\n\t\t1. Learn critical theory\n\t\t2. Apply this to technology\n\t2. Prior knowledge\n2. PRESENT AND PROCESS\n\t1. Instructional Procedures\n\t2. Marxism\n\t3. Structuralism\n3. PRACTICE\n\t1. Student activity\n\n##### Key ideas about Direct Instruction\n1. **The effectivity of Direct Instruction depends on structure, sequence and scaffolding.**\n\t1. The 3 S-es that serve as the characteristics of Direct Instruction serve as its key ingredients, if it is to be used effectively.\n2. **Direct Instruction is a science and an art.**\n\t1. A common misconception of Direct Instruction is that it is rigid in structure and highly prescriptive. \n\t2. Although here in the module you were taught a structure to follow if you were to employ direct instruction, what you do within the 3 Ps (Prepare, Present and Process, Practice) still greatly depends on you! ==Your creativity (the activities you come up with) and your empathy (how much you understand the context of your students) are key ingredients to Direct Instruction success. ==\n\t3. For example, in the present and process part, you can insert some collaborative activities where students can play a more active role. Although we are encouraged to refer to what research has uncovered about good teaching and effective learning, making adjustments and contextualizing to your students is still of utmost importance.\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T15:56:57.0001364Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2022-10-21":{"title":"2022-10-21","content":"## Philippine Design\n#Filipino #design #culture \n\u003e Each of the abovementioned living cultures manifests itself in design. Think of one example each, and in a few sentences, explain to us why you chose these examples. Be more thoughtful and try to go beyond the obvious.\n- **Kultura ng Paglilining at Pangangatwiran:** Cultural Center of the Philippines\n\t- When I think of what can exemplify Kultura ng Paglilining at Pangangatwiran, the Cultural Center of the Philippines comes to mind. It describes itself as \"the premiere showcase of the arts in the Philippines\": music, dance, theater, visual arts, literary, cinematic and design. CCP provides both the space and time for art to be appreciated on its own (art for art's sake), compared to other settings, where art is always attached to a social activity. CCP is also designed to evoke off *sosyal* vibes, which gives off an air of exclusivity and elitism. I imagine this is how Illustrados must have made their other countrymen feel; because of their foreign education, I'm sure that many of them struggled to connect to the everyday Filipino. Same applies to CCP; I don't think it seems accessible to everyone.\n- **Kultura ng Pag-aaliw:** P-Pop groups\n\t- Meanwhile, for Kultura ng Pag-aaliw, I think of Pinoy Pop, or P-Pop. Similar to OPM, despite having \"Pilipino\" in its name, P-Pop is mostly Korean in form and style ‚Äî given that its inspiration is K-Pop. Many released songs tend to have a short lifespan since their aim is to be trendy and catchy. This is what leads others to perceive this kind of music as shallow. Despite this, idols in these groups have a huge influence because of being highly revered by their fans (e.g. stan accounts, fan meetings, photo cards).\n\n- CCP\n\t- \"the premiere showcase of the arts in the Philippines\"\n\t- THE place for showcasing music, dance, theater, visual arts, literary, cinematic and design \n\t- Art is conceived as an autonomous thing; the arts are cultivated as a separate human activity, provided its own space/venue and time for active, concentrated appreciation\n\t- Sosyal vibe lels\n- P-Pop\n\t- Obviously inspired by K-Pop, introduced by Koreans\n\t- Pop and mass media culture\n\t- This subculture specifically targets three groups: \n\t\t- First, teenagers and youths in the peak of physical power and energy who seek equally physical forms of expression; \n\t\t- second, yuppies or young urban professionals who are variously regarded as upscale, ambitious, materialistic, and faddish; \n\t\t- and third, businessmen who thrive in a more impersonal system of production and trade, largely operating within non-family managed corporations.\n\t- Rarely does any form of music be considered classic as these songs just become outmoded in the collective memory and are replaced by newer songs performed by younger artists. Other people perceive this subculture as shallow, and devoid of any deep meanings, considered as antithesis to classical music, film, literature, etc.\n\t- Popular entertainers, movie idols, sports heroes, and icons in many fields are revered. Their invasion in the mainstream media, which is powerful in molding the public‚Äôs percep- tion, is a powerful influence to the youth.","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T15:56:57.0001364Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2022-10-25":{"title":"2022-10-25","content":"## Principles and Methods of Teaching\n#education #teaching \n### Designing Learning: Instruction\n#### Indirect Instruction\n![[images/Pasted image 20221025110804.png]]\n\n**Food for thought:** What does it mean to involve learners? What should teachers to do involve learners?\n\n##### What is Indirect Instruction?\n*TL;DR: Teaching¬†**Concepts**¬†by¬†**Inquiry**¬†and¬†**Problem Solving***\n\n**What is indirect instruction?**\n- As you might easily guess from its name, indirect instruction is to teach students \"indirectly\". The best way to understand this is to compare it to direct instruction. \n- In direct instruction, or what is also referred to as explicit instruction, students are taught the content in the most direct way possible - since the goal is efficiency. In teaching explicitly, the teacher's role is quite prominent - as the expert and source of information and evaluator. \n- Critiques of direct instruction would say that the problem with this approach is that it sometimes dismisses the fact that learners have the capacity to contribute and construct knowledge, not just to be passive receivers of information. \n- This paradigm is grounded in the theory of Constructivism (same as [[Permanent Notes/Constructionism]]?). Therefore, if we are to understand what indirect instruction is, it's best to begin with what constructivism is in education. [Here's a brief overview about it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xa59prZC5gA)\n\n\u003e_\"Constructivist lessons are designed and sequenced to encourage learners to ==use their own experiences to actively construct meaning that makes sense to them==, rather than to acquire understanding through exposure to a format exclusively organized by the teacher (Borich, 2016; Llewellyn, 2007; Schunk, 2011). By reflecting on their own experiences, students continually change what they believe, discard old information and accept new information, and question, explore, and assess what they know.\" (Borich, 2017)_\n\n- According to constructivism, involvement does not just mean physical activity, but ==cognitive activity== as well - acknowledging that there is much to be draw from students' prior knowledge and experience, and that they have the capacity to construct and discover meaning. \n- This opposes a typical imagery of teaching wherein a teacher pours knowledge from his or her head to a students' head (This imagery often assumes that students enter the classrooms as \"tablua rasa\" or blank slates\"). See [[Permanent Notes/Banking model of education]]\n- According to Borich, this method of teaching is best used in helping students meet¬†**Type 2 objectives (Concepts, Patterns, Relationships).**\n- To help you further grasp the concept of indirect instruction, here's a table comparing the \"traditional classroom\" with a \"constructivist classroom\"\n\n![[images/Pasted image 20221025112725.png]]\n\n###### Discussion Board\n\u003e Review the table above. Based on how the constructivist classroom is described, have you experienced constructivism/indirect instruction yourself? Share a story and identify which of the characteristics from the table were present in that experience. (It could be in a formal or informal learning scenario)\n\n\n I see constructivism in my Philippine Design class, which I'm currently taking this semester. Usually, my Information Design classes would be traditional in terms of instruction; in these classes, teachers acted as experts (of software, of theory, etc.) that disseminated knowledge to their students. However, my professor, Sir. Karl Castro designed this class to be different than the rest. Here are traits of a constructivist classroom that I found present in his class:\n\n- The curriculum emphasizes big concepts, beginning with the whole and expanding to include the parts. \n\t- Sir. names his modules after abstract concepts (e.g. rooting,  hybridity, worlding, negotiation)\n- Materials include primary sources of information and manipluative materials.\n\t- At the start of every module, Sir. introduces us to its theme by exposing us to relevant movies, documentaries, and readings. \n\t- Another way he introduces us to the theme is through interactive activities. For example: when he was teaching us about indigenization, he made us bring food to class that went through this process. \n- Learning is interactive, building on what the student already knows.\n\t- Once we're done going through his recommended materials/activities, he makes us process them through class discussions, whether they be in Canvas or Arete.\n\t- His discussion prompts would often ask us to relate our insights to our own experiences (e.g. \"Have you encountered this in your everyday life?\")\n- Assessment includes student works, observations, and points of views, as well as tests. The process is as important as the product.\n\t- Aside from class discussions, he also makes us do creative works. The assignments he'd give are out of the ordinary; for the last two modules, I had to do the following: (1) make an installation piece with my own clothes, and (2) redesign a food product in a Filipino and un-Filipino way.\n\t- Before submitting our final output, he makes us share our process on Canvas. This is done by providing personal notes, sketches, moodboards, etc.\n- Teachers have a dialogue with students, helping them construct their own knowledge.\n\t- Once our outputs are finished, they critiqued by Sir. and our other classmates.  Sir. does critique by engaging in dialogue with the students, asking questions like \"What made you choose this direction?\" and \"Have you considered ____?\".\n\t- Sir. only does direct instruction (i.e. lecturing with slides) after making us construct our own knowledge.\n\n\n##### How is Indirect Instruction done?\nIndirect instruction comes in many forms and strategies. Sometimes, an inquiry-based approach can take the place of the whole learning process for a particular lesson, while sometimes indirect instruction type of activities are done as part of a direct instruction structure (ok, I hope I didn't confuse you there). Let's take a look at a range of examples of this method in action.\n\n- [Indirect Instruction in an elementary class¬†**- whole class discussion**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6OCMBeSwJ4): Here, notice how the teacher introduces the concepts of the hundreds, tens and ones place not by directly providing examples, but by asking students to contribute their ideas.\n- [Indirect Instruction¬†in a high school class - **Jigsaw Strategy**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dvi0ZvOhZs0): Another specific strategy is called the Jigsaw strategy. As with the previous clip, you will still see the teacher greatly involved, but in the strategy, there is a clear attempt to make students active participants in knowledge construction.\n- Indirect Instruction in an elementary class -¬†**projects and questions**: One of the reasons why indirect instruction is getting more traction in the past few years is because of the availability of technology.\n\t- In this [second example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJD_IZOLfKU), instead of the teachers giving the information to students, they frame the learning process through questions and projects instead, and provides guidance along the way.\n\t- Here's [another example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAYh4nWUkU0) of inquiry-based learning, and how this type of learning shifts the classroom from teacher-guided to student-driven.\n- Indirect Instruction-¬†**Project-based learning**: One of the most popular forms of indirect instruction is called project-based learning. In this strategy, students are presented with a problem to solve or a project to do, which becomes the impetus for them to learn the science, math, etc. that is part of the curriculum.\n\t- [Here's another example.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnzCGNnU_WM)\n\t- Sometimes, indirect teaching comes in other forms, such as the use of the case study method. In higher education, this is a more common form of implementation. [Watch this short clip of how the Case Study Method is used in Harvard MBA.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7iwXvBnbIE)\n\n##### Teaching Challenge: Indirect Instruction\nNow, you might be thinking, indirect instruction is very disorganized! Well, not really. Most inquiry-based teaching actually follow a certain framework (there are many). For the purpose of trying it out in this course we will refer to this:\n![[images/Pasted image 20221025114200.png]]\nThis is a common inquiry-cycle model, where the lesson begins with Ask and cycles through the 4 other components. In the process of inquiry, students identify problems,  \nbrainstorm solutions, formulate questions, investigate problems, analyze and interpret results, discuss, reflect, make conclusions, and present results. This cycle of inquiry serves as a general model for teachers planning inquiry activities that can guide students through the inquiry process.\n\n1. **Ask**\n\t1. To promote the desire to discover, the teacher begins by raising questions and inviting students to plan the inquiry procedures and presentation of findings. The teacher initiates the inquiry process by posing the lesson topic in the form of a question and then probing, prompting, and redirecting student responses  to establish the inquiry climate. This is called the ==teacher-initiated phase.==\n\t2. When students are comfortable with the process, the teacher encourages them to raise a question of their own, to plan a procedure for answering the question, to determine how to carry out the procedure, and to decide how the results might be presented. This is called the ==student-initiated phase.== This phase is a vehicle for building student-initiated questions and student-directed procedures that bring students to an independent level of inquiry. A question or a problem is the focus at this stage, which may be redefined later in the inquiry process.\n2. **Investigate**\n\t1. After a student question is agreed on, the next step is to investigate it. At this stage of the inquiry, students are asked to recall prior knowledge or experiences related to the question and to brainstorm possible methods of investigating it by identifying resources and designing and carrying out a plan of action. Students may also redefine their question as new information unfolds. This ==information-gathering stage== is a self-motivated process that is owned by the engaged students.\n3. **Create**\n\t1. When the teacher and students have jointly determined that sufficient information has been gathered, students are asked to begin thinking critically about the relationship between the information (evidence) and their question‚Äîfor example, how the information may or may not answer the question fully or completely. Here students ==synthesize the information they have uncovered to create new knowledge==, which may be beyond their and possibly the teacher‚Äôs prior experience. They start thinking critically about the appropriateness of their question or hypothesis, redefine their question and/or construct new ones, and decide whether to gather more data.  \n\t2. Some interim product is expected at this stage, such as a chart synthesizing the information collected, an oral presentation that summarizes progress thus far, or  a list of new or redefined questions.\n4. **Discuss**\n\t1. At this stage, students discuss their findings, new ideas, and experiences with one another. Students ==share their experiences and investigations in their learning community==, which can be a collaborative group or the entire class. \n\t2. When a small-group format is used, different groups may use the inquiry process to answer different questions that may have evolved from the previous steps (i.e. Steps 2 and 3).\n\t3. The task at this stage may include comparing notes, discussing conclusions, and sharing experiences across groups.\n5. **Reflect**\n\t1. After discussion, ==students critique and communicate their results to their learning community (group or class), during which they are expected to reflect  on their newly acquired knowledge.== Methods for presenting findings are selected in consultation with the teacher. \n\t2. These methods can include a traditional written or oral report or a more extensive multimedia presentation, production, or exhibit. \n\t3. Students‚Äô tasks include reflecting on the appropriateness of their question, their methods of investigation, and the accuracy of their conclusions. These tasks encourage students, either in groups or as a class, to evaluate whether a satisfactory solution was found, whether a new question is warranted, and, if so, what the new question might be by taking inventory of what has been done and making new observations. If new questions emerge, the cycle of inquiry can start again with a new lesson.\n\n![[images/Pasted image 20221025115700.png]]\n\n###### Task\n\u003e Here's another design challenge. Using the framework above, try to design an inquiry-based activity for your lesson's topic. Since inquiry activities can be for a few minutes to several days/sessions, I will give you the freedom to determine the timeframe yourself.¬†\n\u003e 1.) Identify the year level and topic\n\u003e 2.) Identify One (1) Type 2 objective\n\u003e 3.) Propose a set of instructional activities based on the inquiry cycle.\n\n\n**Year Level and Topic:**¬† Cultural Studies of Contemporary Technology for 4th Year University Students\n\n**Type 2 Objective:**¬†Students should be able to critique timely and relevant sociotechnical issues¬†rooted in the Philippine postcolonial experience.\n\n1. Ask: Present a technology with a prompt. How would this manifest in a future Philippines?\n2. Investigate: Relate to own experiences? Make use of insights from class?\n3. Create: process journal \n4. Discuss: share their progress so far with the other students. \n5. Reflect: multimedia output\n\nWhile creating my instructional activities, I was inspired by this experimental course called [\"Imagining Futures: Speculative Design and Social Justice\"](https://english.uchicago.edu/courses/imagining-futures-speculative-design-and-social-justice).  It seeks to disrupt dominant narratives about \"the future\" by exploring alternative futures imagined by and with marginalized communities. Instead of doing just traditional essays and research papers, students also have to create¬†\"short-form, theoretically-founded, and collaborative art projects.\" These projects come from the hands-on methods of speculative design and critical making. I wanted to apply a similar approach to this class!\n\n**ASK: 1st week**\nHere, I will present an emerging technology to the class (e.g. crypto, AI, VR, etc.). Then, I will give them this prompt: \"How would this technology manifest in a future Philippines?\" To answer this, they must create a speculative scenario. This could be done in any format they desire (e.g. presentation, film, artwork with explanation, etc.). My main expectation is that it must touch on possible sociotechnical issues (i.e. will this replicate existing systems of oppression like capitalism and classism?). The class will be divided into groups in order to make this project easier for them.\n\nI'm seeing this activity as a final project for class, so I'll probably put all of the above in a Canvas page, along with other needed details (e.g. rubric). I'll also discuss the final project during a synchronous session so that they could ask questions. \n\n**INVESTIGATE: 1st - 2nd week**\nBefore they can come up with an output, the students must go through intense research. This will primarily be done through scouring secondary resources like news articles, journals, documentaries, etc. Since this is an project, I'll also encourage them to lean on their own experiences as Filipinos. If they have prior experience with the presented technology, this could inform the creation of their output.\n\nWhile they go through this process, I'll continue to provide synchronous lectures and asynchronous modules on critical theories they could make use of (e.g. Marxism, Structuralism).\n\n**CREATE: 3rd week**\nIn the middle of the month, I'll do a checkpoint in Canvas. Here, students have to post findings or experiments from their research process so far. This could be as simple as a bullet point list of sources or as complex as a slide deck of their references. No matter what format they choose, students must demonstrate their creative process and the theories they've used from class to inform this.\n\n**DISCUSS: 3rd week**\nIn this same checkpoint page, I'll also require students to reply to at least one of their classmate's posts. This must be a substantial reply. Saying \"This is nice!\" or \"This is bad!\" isn't enough; there must be constructive feedback that can be used. I'm expecting that most of my students won't have prior experience with critique. So to help them with this process, I'll provide guidelines such as the [Describe-Analyze-Interpret-Evaluate framework](https://snazlan.wordpress.com/2017/04/10/art-critism-four-levels-of-formal-analysis/).\n\n**REFLECT: 4th week**\nAt the end of the month, the groups will present to the class. Here, they must describe the future they conceived (the final scenario), and explain what led them to this (supporting research + theory). When each group is done presenting, I will give them questions or comments on their output. Students from other groups are also free to do the same. \n\n##### Key Ideas: Indirect Instruction\n**1. In Indirect Instruction, students become ==co-creators.==**\nIn Indirect Instruction, the teacher is not the sole source of expertise and information. It acknowledges that students themselves can actively participate in the knowledge and skill building process. Because of this, ==the teacher's role inevitably shifts from expert to guide.==\n\n**2. Indirect Instruction aims for higher order thinking skills.**\nInherent to indirect instruction is that students will be participating in activities that utilize ==higher order thinking skills== (ex. analyzing, evaluating, creating) - most of which often closely relate the lesson to its ==applicability in real-world scenarios.== This presupposes that you have clearly articulated learning objectives at these higher levels.\n\n#### Module 3 Exit Ticket\n1. In this module you learned two broad approaches in designing your instructional activities. Which of the two approaches do you feel more comfortable to utilize? Why?¬†\n\nPersonally, I'm more comfortable utilizing direct instruction. This is because it's the approach that I've been exposed to throughout my whole life. Whether I'd be in a school classroom or a dance studio, I'm used to receiving lessons from teachers, who I'd see as experts.\n\n2. Based on what you learned this module,¬†**what is effective teaching?**¬†(what additional insights did this module add to your definition of effective teaching?)\n\nBased on what I've learned in this module, effective teaching...\n- ...prioritizes the student's learning experience\n- ...uses the right tools for the right purpose\n- ...is structured/sequenced/scaffolded in an intentional way \n- ...enables students to actively participate in the knowledge and skill building process.\n- ...relates lessons to real-world scenarios\n\n3. Since it's the last activity of the module, please also share about your experience as a learner in Module 3. How did you find Module 3? What helped you learn? What hindered learning? (It's okay you can be honest. Your feedback will help me make necessary adjustments in the coming modules, if necessary).¬†\n\nI found the Module 3 easy to go through because of how it was broken down through design (e.g. use of lists, takeaways). Visual aids definitely helped with this! However, I have a bias towards images over videos. This is because they are faster and easier to process; as a busy student with ADHD, I struggle to pay attention to videos for an extended amount of time.\n\n4. The estimated learning time for the whole module is about 4.5 hours (about 1.5 hours per sub module). Did it take you that long? More or less? What were factors that contributed to the length of time?\n\nI believe it took me more than 4.5 hours to go through the whole module.  I think I took longer than usual because of the extra time and effort I put into the teaching challenge, because I really wanted to make it the best that it could be.","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T15:56:57.0001364Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2022-10-30":{"title":"2022-10-30","content":"## Thesis\n#thesis\n### Outline dump\n- Imaginary crisis\n\t- dominant narratives\n\t- individualistic cultures (prompted by survival mode)\n\n\n-   Why can‚Äôt we fully maximize innovation?

With the publication of Fausto J. Galauran‚Äôs Doktor Kuba in 1933, the Philippines actually has the oldest written Science Fiction tradition in Southeast Asia. Despite an early start, the country has had comparatively few serious Science Fiction works in any medium. This is problematic as nothing shapes the vision for a country‚Äôs future like Science Fiction does. As historian Yuval Noah Harari has said: ‚Äú_Today science fiction is the most important artistic genre. ‚ÄúIt shapes the understanding of the public on things which are likely to change our lives and society more than anything else in the coming decades_.‚Äù\n\n\u003e As scholar Dominic Cimafranca observes, Philippine science fiction may not be as popular as fantasy and horror because of the predilection of Philippine writers to highlight internal characteristics, such as those found in stories of the magical and the fantastic, as opposed to external forces, such as those found in stories about technological and scientific advances. However, Philippine science fiction is an important genre to cultivate because it imagines and shapes a future ‚Äì a future that, hopefully, improves on our present conditions.\n\n\u003e For a nation to progress, to move forward, it is first necessary to dream about where it can go (as well as the scenarios it needs to avoid). Science Fiction is fertile ground for this type of thinking and this is why it‚Äôs important for every nation to create its own body of suppositional fiction.\n\u003e \n\u003e This is particularly true for post-colonial developing nations like the Philippines. The bulk of Science Fiction comes from the United States, the UK and Japan (the latter primarily for anime and its derivatives). ==The outlook and point-of-view of such culturally dominant narratives is imposed on the rest of the world simply because it‚Äôs the only one readily available in the market.==\n\u003e \n\u003e The Philippines (and by extension the rest of the world) needs its writers to add their voices to what should be a multi-ethnic, multi-perspective chorus. Never mind that the international market prefers ‚Äúwestern-style SF‚Äù at this time. Never mind that very few Filipino writers can write without any vestige of western colonialism. The country needs more stories to define the future it wants and deserves.\n\u003e \n\u003e \"...The fundamental premise of sci-fi is not spaceships and lasers ‚Äî it‚Äôs that children can learn from the mistakes of their parents.‚Äù\n\u003e It‚Äôs about dreaming the future.\n\u003e In fact it‚Äôs time for the Filipino to dream a multiplicity of futures. ==It‚Äôs time to figure out where we want to go as a nation (because you really wouldn‚Äôt want the politicians and/or showbiz personalities to do it for you).== It‚Äôs time to create our Science Fiction.\n\n### Word Dump\nWorks commissioned by the Exploration and Future Sensing team of Omidyar Network, a social change venture investing in the creation of more inclusive and equitable societies. One of them is Portals to Beautiful Futures, their Trends to Watch report for 2021. Instead of settling for a list of trends, they partnered with the Guild of Future Architects to reimagine the report as a multifaceted series of provocations.\n\n\nCriteria must be also set for the materials that will be included in the database. First, included materials must be a criticism of technology and/or cover technology through the lens of the humanities and social sciences. Next, they must also be considered long-form, whether they come in written or video content (a minimum of 1,200 words or 30 minutes). Then, they must be published by institutions like universities, nonprofits, and publications; exceptions will be made for independently published materials, like personal blog posts, if the author is considered established in their field of study (through education and work experience). Finally, these must also be in the English language, due to the personal limitations of the researcher. Materials will be collected through mainly online methods, such as personal research and crowdsourcing on social media.\n\n**The researcher also acknowledges that the study may be skewed in terms of education and social class due to the existence of a digital divide: people who have access to technology and can fully leverage it are more likely to come from privileged backgrounds.**\n\n¬†\n¬†The more creative our imaginations are, the more capable we are of achieving better futures: ones where technology is made for us, not against us. Before we can push for better innovation, we must be able to criticize the current state of the technologies that surround us, \n\nThus, in order to make equitable technological development the standard, critical perspectives on technology must be made accessible to all. Technologists are capable of this; given that they already make the act of consumption easier and more efficient for us (e.g. one-click buying and personalization algorithms), surely it‚Äôd be possible to do the same for the act of learning¬† ‚Äî a.k.a. consuming knowledge ‚Äî as well.\n\n#### RRL\n- Designing with intention can be done by developing and following evaluation criteria, guidelines, standards, codes, and laws.\n- [Future imaginaries in the making and governing of digital technology: Multiple, contested, commodified](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1461444820929321):\n\t-   Weave into the introduction na lang\n\t-   [[Permanent Notes/Imaginaries]] are collectively held and institutionally stabilized\n\t-   Nonetheless, they are multiple, contested and commodified rather than monolithic, linear visions of future trajectories enacted by state actors.\n\t-   Imaginaries are increasingly dominated by technology companies who not only take over the imaginative power of shaping future society.\n\t- They also partly absorb public institutions‚Äô ability to govern these very futures with their rhetoric, technologies and business models.\n\t- Transition: exploring technological imaginaries made by people, whether they are users or builders\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T15:56:57.0001364Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2022-11-06":{"title":"2022-11-06","content":"## Principles and Methods of Teaching\n#education #teaching \n### Facilitating Learning: Teaching with Questions\n_You will begin by exploring the whys, hows and whats of using questions for teaching._\n#### The wise old man or the conductor?\n![[images/Pasted image 20221106234657.png]]\n![[images/Pasted image 20221106234707.png]]\n\nNotice the two images above. We'll call the first one (left): \"the wise old man\"-with his arms behind him, like a supervisor inspecting goods, and his noticeably grey hair indicating age (and often with a connotation of wisdom). Then, we have the guy on the right picture. We'll call him \"The Conductor\" - portrayed looking at his orchestra, each member holding a musical instrument.¬†\n\nThese two guys are examples of ==how teachers perceive themselves.== Some perceive themselves like the wise old man, an expert and inspector, the source of wisdom and knowledge. If this teacher could choose a picture that would be posted on every starbucks, it will probably be of him talking in front of a lecture hall, with his students' eyes fixed on him. On the other hand, some teachers perceive themselves as the conductor - stepping into the classroom not just to be the source of \"music\" but to create the space for their students to \"make music\".¬†_(Ok, obviously the analogy is not perfect - the orchestra often follows a certain musical piece and does not allow the members to go astray, which sometimes prefer to happen in the classroom, but I think you get the point)._¬†If the conductor were to choose an image for the starbucks poster, it will probably feature his students playing music, not him.\n\nOf course, there is a place for both types of teachers: expertise is as important as the ability to facilitate learning. However, as we've learned from Hirst, it's not the teacher who does the learning, the students do.¬†_Therefore, ==how might we effectively encourage students to think, engage and learn with us, teachers? How might we help our students \"make music\"?_==¬†These are some of the questions we'll ask in this last module\n\n#### Who is learning?\nThe tricky part about teaching is that learning is not very visible. After all, it's happening in the heads of your learners (more about this in part 2). However, despite this limitation, we do know¬†**how**¬†learning happens.¬†_We know that learning is an active process!_\n![[images/Pasted image 20221106234855.png]]\n\nSo, the key question is: How can we create more opportunities for this active process to happen? What we know from the earliest teachers (like Socrates) is that ==we can do it through questions!== Here's a quick trivia about questions. How many questions do you think a typical teacher asks everyday? The answer: 395. To illustrate, a grade 3 teacher asks a question every 43 seconds (Stevens in Mariano and Simms, 2014).¬†\n\n==_What questions should we ask? Where will students' answers come from? How can we elicit responses from students?_¬†== These are some of the questions we'll discuss in this first part of the module.\n\n#### Questions about questions\nTo help you design your own questions for your teaching, we will ask 3 important design questions:\n1. What questions should we ask?\n2. Where will students' answers come from?\n3. How can we we elicit responses from students?\n\n##### Questioning Techniques and Teachers‚Äô Role in the Classroom\nhttps://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1268029.pdf\n\n\u003e The aim of this study is to discuss the ==efficacy of questioning techniques== of the teachers in the classroom. Proper questioning techniques are important in the teaching and learning process. Proper questioning techniques will make it easier for teachers to get feedback from students whether or not they understand the subject. This article describes some of the questioning techniques that a teacher needs to know to possess in classroom teaching and learning sessions such as ==attention, suitable voice. Pause, question content, and distribution of questions.== This is important for ==enhancing student motivation== and ==promoting positive, critical, and creative thinking== among students and ==to improve the teaching and learning process== in the classroom.\n\n###### Questioning Techniques\n1. Attention\n\t1. About this, the question must be ==addressed to the whole classroom== before a student is asked to answer.\n\t2. Teachers should also ==ask a question first before mentioning the name of a student to answer the question posed.== This is to ensure that all students are focused on the questions that are posted.\n\t3. Teachers should always ask questions to ==all students in the classroom== and not just to the students who raise their hands. Attention and care should be given to all the students in the classroom.\n\t4. In the meantime, some students who are not paying attention will ask the teacher to repeat the question. In this case, ==the teacher should not repeat the question posed when asked by the student to repeat it.== If the teacher repeats the question, then, of course, the student will not pay attention, so to attract the students, the teacher should mention the question only once.\n2. Voice\n\t1. When asking questions, teachers should make sure ==their voices are clear and that their tone is well-heard.==\n\t2. The questions should be ==presented well and clear== to the students and look forward to receiving answers.\n3. Pause\n\t1. After submitting a question, the teacher should be the one to ==pause talking for a moment and look at the whole class.== Note the ==verbal cues== that indicate that the student is ready to respond.\n\t2. After asking questions, students should be ==given time to think about the answers.== The time given should ==not be too long== because if it is too long, the interest in it will fade.\n4. Content of Questions\n\t1. In asking a question, a teacher should plan the types of questions that will be asked in the classroom. \n\t\t1. In this case, it may not be necessary for these questions to be prepared in advance, but the ==‚Äòaxis question‚Äô== needs to be designed. \n\t\t2. The axis questions should be arranged in a logical order to obtain continuity in the lesson. In a given lesson, the teacher should provide some questions like this to ==determine the desired direction.== These questions should not be too long.\n\t2. At the same time, teachers should also ask questions that are ==relevant to the age and ability== of the students in the class. \n\t\t1. Teachers are already aware of a student‚Äôs ability in a classroom. So when asking questions, teachers can ==ask difficult questions to the clever and gifted students, and ask easy questions to the weak students.== The simple questions posed to the weaker students will enable them to answer the question, and this will motivate them and stimulate their thinking.\n\t3. Teachers should also encourage ==questions that imply answers. ==\n\t\t1. Teachers should also ensure that the words used in a question are easy to understand. Students will be confused if they do not understand the words that are used in a question. \n\t\t2. If a question is misunderstood by the students, the teacher should change his or her word, but the student should be given a chance to answer first.\n\n###### Distribution of Questions\n- In asking questions, teachers should ask questions to all students in the classroom. Questions shall be given to all the students to encourage them to participate in the teaching and learning process. (Atan Long, 1980: 145) \n- Teachers should also ==avoid asking questions according to the sitting position== of students in the classroom. This is because students who sat in the back and on the sides of the classroom are not paying attention and in the class. So, questions need to be posed to all students so that all students can focus and participate.\n- In the meantime, any questions a teacher have to ask should be ==in place.== Teachers should ==avoid asking questions when students are in the process of conducting a study or project.== \n- In asking questions and receiving answers from students, teachers should always ==help the student to come up with the correct answers by pulling these answers out of him. ==In this way, students will think more deeply and will try to answer the question. ‚Äú (Sharifah Alwiah Alsagoff, 1983: 215)\n\n###### Levels of Questions\n- Questions that will be posed in the teaching and learning activity should be diversified by the levels of questioning.\n- **Bloom's Taxonomy** applies here\n\t- Knowledge: Knowledge-based questions are questions that can easily digest students‚Äô memory. These types of questions should be chosen by teachers, especially when presenting new topics or ideas for students.\n\t- Understanding: After being exposed to a concept and knowledge, teachers should ask questions that are comprehensible. This means that teaching and learning activities will take place in the dimension of understanding or understanding activities.\n\t- Application: The following features of the questions involve the use of information provided to students. The application questions are intended to help students apply their knowledge through the information provided during the teaching and learning activities.\n\t- Analysis: The feature of the analysis question is that this form of question works to separate ideas. At a higher level, students will be presented with analytical questions, and teachers need to be careful so that students can follow the content of the subject and apply all the skills to them.\n\t- Synthesis: Synthesis questions are questions that can help students to come up with a new idea through the initial information they are exposed to. These skills also require high skills in which teachers need to guide students until they can synthesize information.\n\t- Evaluation: At the highest level, evaluation based questions will be given to students. Evaluation means students should be able to make and maintain their justifications.\n\n###### Other Categories of Questions\n1. **First-Order Questions:** These types of questions are the most commonly used questions. This question is stated in sequence because it follows the sequence of disclosure of information provided in the teaching and learning activities\n2. **Uncovered Questions:** Uncovered questions are a type of question that can gradually grind out students‚Äô knowledge. This technique also requires teachers to tackle creative, clear, and easy questions so that students do not get bored.\n3. **Open-Ended Questions:** Open-ended questions are a form of independent inquiry that seeks to assess students‚Äô abilities and knowledge. Also, students may ask the teacher otherwise for the purpose of obtaining further certainty and clarification. This kind of response is something that is expected of teachers to identify students‚Äô understanding\n4. **Divergent Questions:** Divergent questions are questions that can generate a lot of thinking abilities among students. Subjective questions will help students broaden the scope of their thinking, and this is very important for them to improve their thinking skills.\n\n##### Teaching with Questions Lecture\n###### Part 1: What questions should I ask?\n- 2 paradigms\n\t- **Question Types** (LOTS to HOTS based on Bloom's Taxonomy)\n\t\t- Examples:\n\t\t\t- Ecology ![[images/Pasted image 20221107004204.png]]\n\t\t\t- Marketing ![[images/Pasted image 20221107004356.png]]\n\t- **Questioning Sequences**\n\t\t- 4 phases (+ applied to the ecology example):\n\t\t\t- Details\n\t\t\t\t- Ask questions about important details/areas of focus\n\t\t\t\t- Based on learning outcomes\n\t\t\t- Categories\n\t\t\t\t- Identify examples within a category\n\t\t\t\t- Describe the general characteristics\n\t\t\t\t- Make comparisons within and across categories\n\t\t\t- Elaborations\n\t\t\t\t- explain reasons for characteristics (WHY)\n\t\t\t\t- describe effects of specific characteristics\n\t\t\t\t- project occurences under certain conditions (WHAT IF)\n\t\t\t- Evidence\n\t\t\t\t- identify sources\n\t\t\t\t- explain reasoning\n\t\t\t\t- qualify/restrict conclusions\n\t\t\t\t- find errors in reasoning used\n\t\t\t\t- examine elaborations from diff. perspectives\n\t\t- Example (applied to ecology) ![[images/Pasted image 20221107005913.png]]\n\n\u003e For learning or understanding to happen...\n\u003e There has to be...\n\u003e ...a provocative question\n\u003e ...a puzzling, important problem\n\u003e ...a challenge to current understanding\n\u003e - Dewey, 1997\n\n![[images/Pasted image 20221107010411.png]]\n\n###### Part 2: Where will students' answers come from?\n- They come from...\n\t- Prior knowledge/experiences\n\t- Other sources\n- Zone of Proximal Development\n\t- move slowly from what students can do to what they can't do\n\n![[images/Pasted image 20221107011035.png]]\n\n![[images/Pasted image 20221107011508.png]]\n\n###### Part 3: How can I elicit responses?\n- **Wait time**\n\t- Ask \u003e Pause \u003e Listen \u003e Pause \u003e Ask\n\t- \"Research on classroom questioning and information processing indicates that students need ==at least three seconds== to comprehend a question...\"\n\t- Wait time is think time\n- **Random names**\n\t- Ask \u003e Teacher picks a random name \u003e Student answers\n- **Response chain**\n\t- Ask \u003e Student 1 answers \u003e Ask Student 2 to respond to Student 1\n- **Paired response** (a.k.a.

If you were to facilitate a discussion with your future students, what are 3 questions that you might ask? In the post below,\n\u003e 1. Identify the learning objective/s.\n\u003e 2. Identify the 3 questions and label them according to type or phase.\n\n**Learning objectives:**\n- Students should be able to demonstrate a sufficient understanding of the interactions between culture and technology¬†through closed-book short answer tests¬†where they have to cite keywords + insights from class readings.\n- Utilizing critical theory, students should be able to analyze contemporary technologies through written long-form essays.\n\n**Questions:**\n\nI imagine myself asking these questions to my future students after making them watch this documentary called *Terms and Conditions:*\n\n\u003e **Terms and Conditions:** a documentary film¬†that addresses how corporations and the government utilize the information that users provide when agreeing to browse a website, install an application, or purchase goods online. The film criticizes companies such as¬†[Facebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook \"Facebook\"),¬†[Google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google \"Google\"), and¬†[LinkedIn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LinkedIn \"LinkedIn\")¬†for having poorly worded and misguiding¬†[privacy policies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_Policy \"Privacy Policy\")/[terms of service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terms_of_service \"Terms of service\"), which use user-unfriendly language in long documents and allows the companies to collect user information and legally provide it to third-parties.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terms_and_Conditions_May_Apply#cite_note-1)¬†The film aims to warn people about the risks of clicking \"I Agree\" after scrolling through pages of uninviting text.\n\n\n1. Connect components of a social media platform to elements of structuralism. (Categories)\n\t1. Sign: user-generated content (e.g. posts, stories, comments, etc.)\n\t2. Code: user-service agreements\n\t3. Myth: \"It's okay to give away your personal data\" a.k.a. being apathetic about data privacy\n2. Why do social media platforms uphold this myth about data privacy? (Elaborations)\n3. How can users hold platforms accountable for these privacy issues? (Evidence)\n\n#### Key ideas about Teaching with Questions\n\n**1. Questions**¬†(not just answers)¬†**drive learning.**\nOften, as teachers, there could be a tendency to focus on what we will say (or present), not what we will ask. As we've discussed in this module, ==what we ask matters, because our questions prompt thinking.==\n\n**2. Interaction should be intentionally designed, not just a happy accident.**\nAlthough there are many things we cannot predict about how our class sessions will go, it still pays to be intentional with the kinds of interaction you would like to have with your students and among your students. As an expert teacher in the future, this may just end up feeling \"natural\", such that you don't feel like you need to plan it out anymore (just like in other professions), but as a novice educator, the invitation is to ==carefully plan your \"teaching moves\"¬† first.==","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T15:56:57.0001364Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2022-11-08":{"title":"2022-11-08","content":"## Soul's Gold Reading\n- Higher Guide...Soul's Blueprint\n\t- Orange tree: very stubborn, rooted, persistent (may be perceived as stuck because it looks still)\n\t- very ecosystem\n\t\t- no door...all of it is important and full\n\t- Not super vocal...

Learning objectives (simplified)\n\t\t1. not only will you be able to critically evaluate these texts reflecting diverse cultures...\n\t\t2. but also be able to know how to convey ideas for diverse audiences\n\t3. Agenda for today's session\n\t\t1. Messages/texts\n\t\t2. Semiotics\n\t\t3. Cultural texts\n\t\t4. Evaluating messages\n\t\t5. Activity\n\t4. Start with an example prompt? \n\t\t1. E.G. Does anyone here use dating apps? How would you approach online dating?\n\t\t\t1. get answers from the class...expecting answers on reading the way people text (language), judging their aesthetics (signs)\n\t\t2. After getting answers, I will point out that they all already know how to evaluate messages (unconsciously)\n\t\t3. https://isi.org/intercollegiate-review/tinder-and-semiotics/\n2. Talking about texts\n\t1. Definition of terms\n\t\t1. ‚ÄúMessage‚Äù or text: refers to any recorded message(e.g.,¬†writing,¬†audio-recording,¬†audio-and video-recording) that is physically independent of itssender or¬†receiver\n\t\t3. To produce a quality text, we need to think of:\n\t\t\t1. Structure: how the information is organized.\n\t\t\t2. Language: the means by which the information is expressed verbally and/or nonverbally.\n\t\t\t3. Presentation: the layout, format, length, oral delivery and¬†any other conventions.\n\t2. Introduce/review of semiotics\n\t\t1. How can we interpret messages? through symbiotics\n\t\t2. Definition: the study of signs and symbols, in particular as they communicate things spoken and unspoken In a semiotic sense, signs take the form of words,¬†images¬†sounds,¬†gestures,¬†and objects.\n\t\t3. Signs are composed of...\n\t\t\t1. Signifiers (represenations/modalities such as images, sound, etc.)\n\t\t\t2. Signifieds (concepts)\n\t\t4. Semiotic systems (more than just visual!)...\n\t\t\t1. Linguistic or textual system: vocabulary, structure, grammarof oral/written language, wordchoice, delivery of spoken orwritten text (tone), organizationinto sentences, phrases,paragraphs.\n\t\t\t2. Visual system: Color, vectors and viewpoint in still andmoving images, layout,style, size, perspective.\n\t\t\t3. Audio system: Volume, pitch andrhythm of music and sound effects.\n\t\t\t4. Gestural system: Movement, facial expression and body language, hand gestures, interactions between people.\n\t\t\t5. Spatial system: Proximity, direction, position of layout,organization of objects in space arrangement.\n\t\t5.  Examples: \n\t\t\t1. emojis (a Japanese word thattranslates in English as \"e\" for \"picture\" and \"moji\" for \"character)\n\t\t\t2. emoticons (digitalicons that convey human expressions)\n\t\t\t3. Processing question: ask class what they think is the signifier and the singified in emojis and emoticons \n3. Texts can reflect cultures\n\t1. Prompt\n\t\t1. Since reality is always subject to human interpretation...\n\t\t2. ...a person's background will inherently affect their interpretation of reality\n\t2. Semiotics can refer to a kind of social interaction among individuals who try to make sense out of the different interpretations possibilities of a sign.\n\t\t1. This is where culture comes in\n\t3. Definition: \n\t\t1. Cultural texts are those objects, actions, and behaviors that reveal cultural meanings. \n\t\t2. A photo is an image, but is also a cultural text, a picture with cultural information beyond just the picture itself\n\t4. Provide examples\n\t\t1. Bowing down cartoon\n\t\t2. American v.s. japanese parenting cartoon\n4. Evaluating Messages\n\t1. Why do we need to do this? (connect to examples)\n\t\t1.

He runs an experiment to monitor the level of \"thinking\" happening for one student for 7 days. Spend some time reviewing the graph below. Without delving too much into the science of the experiment, just interpret the graphs to mean that more peaks mean more thinking/more brain activity is happening.\n![[images/Pasted image 20221115141159.png]]\n\u003e note: it is unclear what is being done in class (we assume here that it is probably a straight lecture). This is not to say that lectures are bad and ineffective - they can, in fact, be quite effective!\n\u003e However, if most of the time it's just the teacher talking in front, there is less of a chance to actually \"see\" learning happen. This is what we try to address by asking more questions.¬†\n\u003e In this 2nd part of the module, we will build on this idea of making learning more visible to both learners and teachers. We'll do so by reviewing some strategies produced from the research conducted by Harvard Project Zero.\n\n#### Visible Thinking Routines\n- Overview of thinking routines: [**Development of Harvard Project Zero featuring Ron Ritchhart**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFNpxBLyFQk)\n- Example of a thinking routine: [**Think, Puzzle, Explore in the Classroom**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLXglUq5slY)\n- [**Project Zero's Thinking Routine Toolbox**](http://www.pz.harvard.edu/thinking-routines)\n\n#### Module 4 One Big Final Exit Ticket\n1. As a final exit ticket for module 4 and the course, use¬†[any visible thinking strategy¬†Links to an external site.](http://www.pz.harvard.edu/thinking-routines)to help you synthesize what you learned from this course. If you prefer to do it on paper, you can do so and just post a picture of your work. Share your answer and why you think that is the most appropriate strategy to use.\n\n2. Since it's the last activity of the module, please also share about your experience as a learner in Module 4. How did you find Module 4? What helped you learn? What hindered learning? (It's okay you can be honest. Your feedback will help me make necessary adjustments in the coming modules, if necessary).¬†\n\n4. The estimated learning time for the whole module is about 3 hours (about 1.5 hours per sub module). Did it take you that long? More or less? What were factors that contributed to the length of time?\n\n**Visible Thinking Strategy:** Color, Symbol, Image is a routine for distilling the essence of ideas non-verbally. Out of all the other strategies under the \"Synthesizing \u0026 Organizing Ideas\" category, I chose this because I'm a visual learner; as a designer and artist, I find skills such as visual association to be intuitive for me. Thus, this strategy seemed like the easiest to utilize.\n\nWhat I visually associate with the EDUC 130 course:\n- **Color:** Blue. Aside from blue being the color of our Canvas interface, I chose blue because it is great at promoting high levels of thought. For instance: blue paper, blue ink, or blue highlighting can be used to help improve reading comprehension. Blue's utility is especially seen in learning situations that are challenging. For example: people with occupations that require a high cognitive load, such as programmers and academics, are more productive in a blue environment.   Just like the color blue, the methods I've learned for designing and facilitating learning are all ways to help our students with processing knowledge (e.g. scaffolding, questioning techniques, thinking routines).\n- **Symbol:** A ticket. I associated this with Entrance and Exit Ticket activites teachers would often utilize in their classrooms, wherein a short prompt would be used to make students either recall relevant background knowledge or reflect on their learnings. This activity shows the important role of student feedback in guiding teaching decisions. Without feedback, teachers won't be able to help students connect to the lesson (Activate from Context ‚Üí Connect to Content) or gauge their understanding of it (Evaluate to Validate). \n- **Image:** Brain waves in the classroom. I thought of this image after being inspired by Dr. Ito's brain activity monitoring experiment. I chose this because I think all teachers should aim for high brain-to-brain synchrony. We can only say that our lessons are effective and engaging if we ensure that no learner gets left behind. Teachers who are mindful of student and teacher factors will be able to equitably engage with their learners.\n  \n**Sources:**\n- https://www.shiftelearning.com/blog/how-do-colors-influence-learning\n- https://www.brown.edu/sheridan/teaching-learning-resources/teaching-resources/course-design/classroom-assessment/entrance-and-exit\n- https://kids.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frym.2020.00096\n\n**My experience as a learner in Module 4:**\n- It was interesting being exposed to all the different kinds of different routines! However, I preferred the previous modules because of how they contained much more written and visual information, which made it easier for me to take notes (compared to external sources like videos and websites). I did like how Project Zero's Thinking Routine toolbox contained easily digetsible PDFs for each routine!\n- I do think that I spent the expected amount of time on this module. Perhaps because it was shorter, and there wasn't as much activities to do?\n\n#### Summary of Module 4\n**1.**¬†Design varied and deepening questions that intend to elicit learning for specific learning objective.\n**2.**¬†Accurately demonstrate the use of a visible thinking strategy for a specific lesson.\n\n## PH Design\n#design #culture #Filipino \n### Reclaiming our Narrative (2021)\n_Reclaiming our Narrative: Inclusivity and Decolonization_¬†(2021):¬†[https://www.facebook.com/nbdb.phil/videos/124056096443064/](https://www.facebook.com/nbdb.phil/videos/124056096443064/)\n\n\u003e POST-PANDEMIC FUTURES.

Pre-Hispanic Philippine art and expression were minuscule: it focused on meaning and tradition, not the grandiose. On the other hand, post-colonial art and expression are influenced by our colonizers' form of art and expression, which were grand in size and focused more on forms, not the embedded meaning.== This expression of culture is exquisite yet minuscule, may it be textile, jewelry, woodwork, sculptures, and other crafts - even in weaponry and armor.¬†As seen in the screenshot below, this shield had various inscriptions all over, which were a mix of religious texts of the Moro people.\n\u003e Other parts of the presentation that piqued my interest were her discussion of a number of terms that were to be junked and ones that should be used with care. Some of the terms to be junked that she mentioned caught my attention - specifically Malay (which she explained was a language and not a race) and race (which is not a legit category). I always thought that the Philippines came from the \"Malay\" people given the many commonalities we have in terms of culture and physique. She debunked such, explaining that the Filipinos are part of the Austronesian-speaking people that originated from Taiwan (not Chinese nor Han) and spread Southwards to Indonesia, Malaysia, and Polynesian areas. She added that the languages of the islands in the Polynesian areas actually originated from the Philippines, citing that some people from Luzon sailed out into the Pacific Ocean, ending up on a then-uninhabited island - Guam. In relation to such, Ms. Marian also clarified some terms to use with care such as dialect. I always had confusion with these two terms, but she clarified such, saying that Cebuano and Tagalog are not dialects, but languages. Some examples of dialects are the Batangas-Tagalog and Mindoro-Tagalog dialects.\n\u003e Lastly, her closing also piqued my interest. She explained that all that she has shared in her presentation, although may sound opinionated (specifically the portion of \"Words to Junk\"), are based on scientific evidence and scholarly research. The information she shared has been agreed upon by many archaeologists globally, yet is not known to the locals who are the topic of the research. She says that the problem lies in ==how this information is not circulated in mainstream media.== Furthermore, she suggests solving this problem ==not only by publishing this information to make it accessible physically but by also translating this knowledge from scientific to easily digestible terms.== She ends by saying that \"the task of knowing the updated, evidence-based syntheses about the Filipinos more than a nationalistic endeavor. It concerns social justice.\"\n\n#### Discussion Board\n**Share a screenshot of one scene or moment from the webinar. In a few sentences, explain to us why this image stood out for you.**\n\n![[images/Pasted image 20221115145317.png]]\n\nThis slide stood out to me from the webinar because of how much it reminded me of the process of *indigenization*, which we discussed in Module 2. In a world filled with tribalistic news and disinformation, the Filipino identity is being pigeonholed into restrictive definitions. We have to realize that it is impossible to define what it means to be Filipino without acknowledging how we are made up of foreign influences.\n\n### Disjuncture and Difference in the Global Cultural Economy\nIn understanding Philippine design, it is important to appreciate and understand the dynamics of cultural flows.\n\n- READ: ‚ÄúDisjuncture and Difference in the Global Cultural Economy‚Äù\n- See: [[Miscellaneous Notes/Daily Notes/2022-07-13]]\n- https://socialsci.libretexts.org/Courses/HACC_Central_Pennsylvania's_Community_College/ANTH_205%3A_Cultures_of_the_World_-_Perspectives_on_Culture_(Scheib)/13%3A_Globalization/13.02%3A_The_Acceleration_of_Globalization\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_cultural_flows\n\n\u003e Choose one particular Philippine design object that you love. (Please include an image and related links.) Using Appadurai‚Äôs five proposed landscapes, identify the cultural flows that produced the work.\n\n![[images/Pasted image 20221115152553.png]]\n\n**Philippine Design object:** Local zines! I will be using the ones made by [Mak√≥ Micro-Press](https://makomicropress.com/) as an example.\n- **Ethnoscapes** \n\t- When they settled in the Philippines, our colonizers (i.e. the Spanish, Americans, Japanse) brought with them colonial values, ideas, mindsets, etc. One of the ways they disseminated this was through presses.\n\t- One of the earliest underground publications, La Solidaridad, was created by a group of ilustrados. Many of them were educated in¬†Spain, which exposed them to European liberal¬†and nationalist ideals.\n- **Technoscapes**\n\t- The rise of alternative press publications such as zines wouldn't have been possible without the large-scale production and distribution of the printing press.\n\t- Photocopying machines also played a big role in their circulation, as seen in Xerox Journalism: the underground or illegal publishing that occurred during Martial Law. \n\t- The advent of the Internet kickstarted digital self-publishing. Creators can distribute their zines by uploading them as PDF copies to personal storage platforms or online repositories, such as Google Drive and the Anarchist Library. Blogs and social media websites like Instagram are also hopeful for promotion; these platforms can be seen as the \"modern\" equivalent of zines due to their shared self-published nature.\n\t- Despite the 21st century's primary focus on everything digital, the print format of the zine remains relevant. By sticking to print, zines rebel against the cultural dominance of internet platforms. The format also gives creators ‚Äúsafety in-print‚Äù by helping them avoid strict copyright and community standard restrictions, along with malicious attention (e.g. redtagging). \n- **Financescapes**\n\t- The introduction of electronic money through mobile wallets like GCash and Maya have definitely made it easier to sell zines to a wider audience. Now, self-publishers are no longer restricted by physical confinements and print runs that only reach those who attend events.\n\t- Financescapes can also be seen in the growing popularity of zines. It could be said that their rise stems partly from an economic shift, particularly in the creative sector. Zine veteran Paolo Jose Cruz notes how in recent times there had been a¬†_‚Äúgeneral clamor for more tangible analog and print media‚Äù_¬†as well as a commercial landscape that leans towards¬†_‚Äúmore niche or specialty arts and craft hobbies.‚Äù_¬†And with this focus on creative work, sprung more avenues; examples of these avenues are fine arts classes and workshops about¬†_‚Äúmonetizing art creation‚Äù_¬†and the emergence of mixed spaces where zines can find a substantial consumer base.\n\t- These mixed spaces are local fairs, expos, and conventions. Through a steady combination of marketing and select exhibitors, zine creators were pushed into broader public consciousness and propelled the scene towards popularity. By shunning traditional notions of marketing, self-publishers, zine fair organisers and editors are generating validity around underrepresented artists and makers.\n- **Mediascapes**\n\t- ¬†The bourgeois take control of the media industry. One example is Martial Law censorship, wherein the industry was monopolized by Marcos' regime. Newspapers, radio and TV networks run by Marcos cronies served as mouthpieces of the dictatorship. The Marcos regime also established the Kapisanan ng mga Brodkaster ng Pilipinas (KBP or Association of Broadcasters of the Philippines) as a way of controlling the broadcast industry under the doctrine of self-censorship. Now, we can still see this censorhsip today, given our current government (e.g. ABS-CBN shutdown).\n\t- In contrast to this: Self-publishing is heavily rooted in the Punk subculture, wherein musical freedom was connected with the human ability to reason and ask questions. In line with this, it was a disc jockey (Dante ‚ÄúHowling Dave‚Äù David) who introduced fanzines to Metro Manila on his show at dzRJ 810 ‚ÄúRock of Manila‚Äù. Consequently, many early local fanzines were centered around alternative music.\n- **Ideoscapes**\n\t- Writer and self-publisher Adam David states that zines must serve as manifestos, not propagandas. The latter involves messaging wherein the reader is coereced into believing false truths, while the former is a manifestation of one's inner truth, or that of the movement they choose to belong to. Manifestos, being proactive, encourage the reader to join a cause or adopt a mindset.\n\t- Through zines and other DIY (Do-It-Yourself) artwork, Mak√≥ Micro-Press aims to create and sustain counter-hegemonic cultures. Critiquing existing systems of oppression (e.g. capitalism, fascism), they advocate for alternative radical movements such as socialism and abolitionism.\n\t- Utilizing the Filipino language in their zines helps Mak√≥ helps disseminate these ideologies. This kind of translation is vital in a nation that is heavily misinformed about these movements, as seen in the pervasiveness of redtagging.\n\n**Sources:**\n- https://aramslasharam.wordpress.com/2018/02/10/19/\n- https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED311426.pdf\n- https://www.cnnphilippines.com/life/culture/literature/2017/08/30/zine-making-adam-david.html\n- https://purveyr.com/2018/09/10/zine-culture-in-the-philippines/\n- https://www.dazeddigital.com/artsandculture/article/25561/1/how-the-internet-revived-the-zine-scene\n\n### Pamumuna, pagtutol, pagka-Filipino, pagkabansa\n\nEach of the abovementioned living cultures manifests itself in design. Think of one example each, and in a few sentences, explain to us why you chose these examples. Be more thoughtful and try to go beyond the obvious.\n\n-   Kultura ng Pamumuna at Pagtutol: Culture of Social Criticism, Concern, and Protest\n\t- When I think about Kultura ng Pamumuna at Pagtutol, Mako Micropress's stickers come to mind. These would often advocate human rights and critque social issues such as neoliberalism and neocolonialism. I'd see these stickers often at local conventions and stores like Common Room. At first, I didn't fully understand what these stickers were talking about; this led me wanting to learn more. I definitely believe that these stickers influenced me to have radical values.\n-   Kultura ng Pagkabansa: \n\t- For Kultura ng Pagkabansa, I can't help but think about BBM's presidential campaign. Albeit being twisted, this campaign was built on nationalist sentiments, e.g. unity. His campaign slogan, \"Sama-sama tayong babangon muli\", is reminiscent of Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" ‚Äî both presidents reeking of right-wing populism. Unfortunately, his campaign achieved its desired, as seen with his 31 million voters. When his voters changed their profile pictures to red squares, they did it to show that they were being devoted Filipinos.\n\n![[images/Pasted image 20221115172029.png]]\n![[images/Pasted image 20221115172503.png]]\n\n### Ating Buhay\n#### Prompt\n\u003e In this module, we learned about how our culture and identities‚Äîincluding our design practices‚Äîare negotiated amid the push and pull of ideology and political economy. Our experience as a nation is full of traumas, disappointments, and lacunae; thus, we tend to feel deracinated, unmoored, lost.¬†\n\u003e \n\u003e Sometimes, we are doubtful of identifying as Filipino‚Äîafter all, what is ‚ÄúFilipino‚Äù anyway? And yet, whatever design practice you will develop from hereon will be part of the corpus known as ‚ÄúPhilippine design.‚Äù¬†\n\u003e \n\u003e In this project, we will try to locate your life as part of the historical progression of our nation‚Äôs narrative. Whatever your experience, it is part of the Filipino story.\n\n[**Measure your history with material. | Sonya Clark | The Art Assignment**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTn9N8rsm-M)\n- Today we talk to textile artist Sonya Clark, who applies the techniques of textile work to represent her personal and cultural history. Her assignment draws on her insightful approach to histories and asks you to represent yours.\n- INSTRUCTIONS - Measuring Histories \n\t1. Think about an aspect of your personal or cultural history that is hard to imagine \n\t2. Select a material to quantify, measure, and actualize that history \n\t3. Or, do something familiar to you for as long as you can and measure it to see what it lines up with from your personal or cultural history\n\n\u003e Ponder on your life so far. Think of a material available to you, and how it can embody something about your history (whether as an individual, part of a family or in relation to a community), something meaningful to you that you would like to share. Devise a work by exploring this material. Note: this exercise may require you to look into parts of you that you‚Äôve avoided or been uncomfortable talking about, and hence be met by difficulty or hesitation. Lean into that discomfort.\n\n#### Proposals\n- I think i want to lean into my girly roots\n- thinking about my struggle with identity..\n- stickers?\n- dress-up games, piccrew\n- https://society.mirror.xyz/8HWXty6Zvzje_vGv9TPFHRoJZ38feL3tFCvOPcLKz_U\n\t- Dollz, and their era, cemented the idea of the self-expression and value of the avatar creator beyond paper dolls.

This is not surprising, given that ==most digital technologies are produced by and for urban, Global North populations.== When the focus shifts to Indigenous, rural, or Global South communities, discussions tend to be much ==more instrumental and one-dimensional== (Salemink et al., 2017). In these contexts, ==digital participation is often implicitly assumed to be beneficial in instrumental ways‚Äîit enables economic advances and provides access to better services and governance.== This assumption allows focus to be placed squarely on technocratic questions related to access and digital divides (Roberts et al., 2017). Less investigated are the knowledge politics which shape and constrain the types of political and economic engagement that digital connectivity makes possible, and whether those forms of engagement are compatible with the specific needs and desires of populations that fall outside of the urban, Global North.\n\n\u003e In response to this gap, scholars are increasingly calling for new research agendas focused on ==the critical examination of ICTs outside the Global North.== D√© et al. (2018), for example, argue that ==there is currently ‚Äúinadequate theory to examine how the local context [of developing countries] is impacted by ICT and how ICTs are impacted by the local context.‚Äù== (67) They call for stronger inclusion of postcolonial thinking within ICT for development (ICT4D) interventions to facilitate the exploration of new, critical questions. Within the disciplines of geography, digital geographies researchers are exploring similar forms of research. Thatcher et al. (2016) have called for the development of a political economy of data, to better understand ==the role of the digital in everyday processes of capitalist exploitation.== In each case the researchers call for greater attention to the colonial implications of technology engagement. This paper contributes to this growing body of work by examining how digital practices facilitate new forms of knowledge politics that have colonial impacts for Indigenous communities. Specifically, I argue that digital engagement can erode the embodied and social practices that are critical to the transmission of some forms of Indigenous knowledge. I ground this argument in a critical examination of ICT usage within an Inuit community in the Canadian Arctic.\n\n\u003e This research documents how ==many ICT interventions extend globally dominant power and knowledge systems into affected communities in the Global South== (Burns, 2014; Heeks, 2008; Walsham, 2012). However, this work remains primarily focused on the institutional adoption of ICTs for development work, and there are few studies grounded in the empirical realities of how digital knowledge politics unfold in specific Indigenous communities. In the context of the Arctic, the closest research has come to examining these issues is a handful of projects on the negative impact of social media on the language (Inuktitut) and culture of Inuit (e.g. Pasch, 2008, 2010; Savard, 1998). This paper builds on that prior work by extending analysis explicitly to interactions between digital practices and Inuit knowledge.\n\n[**History of Philippine Digitalization**](https://digitaljustice.cp-union.com/publications/2021/09/09/History-Philippine-Digitalization)\n\u003e This paper entitled ‚ÄúHistory of Digitalization in the Philippines‚Äù discusses digitalization in the Philippines with a particular emphasis on the roots and current status of its information and communications technology (ICT). This research suggests that although the Philippines is one of the early colonial countries in Asia-Pacific to obtain and use early-digitized technologies, the foreign-dependent economic model under its colonial masters and neoliberalism-oriented leaders had hampered the industrialization of the country most notably in the 1960s-70s. The lost momentum to industrialize, along with economic policies that are foreign-oriented, caused the Philippines to become dependent on the service industry. ==The lack of national industry and grand political plan to do so lead the Philippine ICT to be highly reliant on foreign technologies and software which has a negative impact on the pace of current digitalization in the Philippines.==\n\n[**Introduction: the dynamics of digital communication in the Philippines: legacies and potentials**](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1329878X211010868)\n\u003e The following articles demonstrate manifestations and dynamics of capitalist \nmodernity. We identify three overlapping themes which indicate how the affordances \nand uses of digital media contribute to the accumulation of various forms of capital \nand the acceleration of social processes that create new and reinforce existing social \ninequalities (Fuchs, 2014; Rosa, 2014). The ethnographic and qualitative nature of the \nstudies provides nuances to the simultaneous possibilities for liberation and \nexploitation (Jordan, 2015) amid digital media‚Äôs embedding in everyday life. Each \ntheme characterises a socio-technical dynamic that indicates continuities, \ncontradictions and changes in society. \n\n\u003e Digital media uses, practices and experiences are rooted in pre-existing social and \ncultural formations, economic structures and political systems (Athique, 2019). Even \nas the digital media environment presents various possibilities for action and social \nrelations, uneven infrastructure and material conditions shape people‚Äôs engagements \nwith digital media. This is salient in Toyama‚Äôs (2011) argument that ==technologies are \nnot transformative or democratising in themselves, but rather, they amplify human \nforces along with existing inequalities and missing institutional capaci- ties==\n\n[**Digital Justice Perception Survey**](https://digitaljustice.cp-union.com/publications/2021/08/26/Digital-Justice-Perception-Survey)\n\u003e The Digital Justice Perception Survey (DJPS) of the Philippine Digital Justice Initiative (PHDJI) is research whose aim is to gather the perception and gauge the level of literacy of Filipinos regarding data justice and other substantially related issues. With internet-connected citizens of Metro Manila participating in the survey, it was found that a significant portion of respondents is still unequipped on the concepts of digitalization and digital justice despite the stated confidence and familiarity on their part. Although some are knowledgeable on the basics, a huge portion is still either neutral or unaware of the topic of digital justice and the like. This research concludes that further educational campaigns (preferably specialized) and movements to educate and equip the public are very much needed, especially with the rapidity of digitalization intensified by the ongoing pandemic.\n\n**Transforming Technologies: Altered Selves ‚Äì Mobile Phones and Internet Use in\nthe Philippines**\n\u003e Following these ‚Äúconclusions and extrapolations,‚Äù chapters 1 and 2 provide broad perspectives on cellphones and the Internet in the context of the Philippines. In chapter 1 on ‚ÄúScience, Technology and Culture,‚Äù Pertierra offers a pessimistic assessment of the former fields (science and technology) in the context of the latter (Filipino culture). His position is that Filipino culture is very open to receiving and consuming technologies produced elsewhere (such as cellphones), but that a cultural aversion to excellence and specialization has proven a general impediment to the development of basic science and therefore local production of innovative technologies. ==Filipino society, he argues, can take technologies from elsewhere ‚Äì jeeps or cellphones, for instance ‚Äì and refashion them for use in the local context, but due to the discouragement of specialization is less adept at more fundamental scientific or technological originality.==\n\n- relate to concept of indeginization from Philippine design\n\n[**The Role of Everyday Culture for a Scientific Orientation in Philippine Society: Are the Youth Any

the platform economy](https://www.scielo.br/j/soc/a/xsw6y66hJR6X5BQhjKc59JK/?format=pdf\u0026lang=en)\n\t\t\t- EXAMPLE\n\t\t\t- As such, we propose the term digital labor bayanihan as encapsulating a Filipino cultural value that shapes the collective ‚Äúanchoring‚Äù of digital platform workers to survive a precarious digital market. Although this ‚Äúconcept‚Äù emerges from the Philippine context, the ideas may be relatable to or extended in contexts where sources of collective imaginaries are comparable. \n\t\t\t- In the process of coaching, labor influencers also cascade imaginaries of success to their audiences...These imaginaries of success can be seen as a modern form of ‚Äúcoaching‚Äù manifested through self-branding techniques such as repetition styles and sharing of personal narratives.\n\t\t\t- While [digital labor influencers] play a crucial role in helping workers make sense of platform labor when they have no better alternatives nor access to similar forms of dynamic guidance elsewhere, they also cascade imaginaries that workers hang on to, as these nurture their economic and social aspirations, whether these latter are realized or not. It is in the heart of such contradictions that platform workers imagine new forms of sociability, visions of happiness, and economic capacities, despite uncertainty on whether these can in fact be actualized (de Peuter et al., 2017). This implies that they also perform the role not only of bridging workers with each other, but bridging workers with platforms, essentially performing unpaid labor for digital platforms. It follows that they also serve as promoters of the Philippine government‚Äôs vision of promoting Filipinos as ‚Äúworld class workers‚Äù while allowing it (along with digital platforms) to avoid its responsibility to attend to the deeper structures of labor inequality.\n\t\t\t- TL;DR by cultivating aspirations these influencers also help sustain inequities\n\t\t- \n- Developing countries and tech\n\t- The Innovation Paradox\n\t\t- https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/28341/211160ov.pdf\n\t\t- https://academic.oup.com/book/26367/chapter-abstract/194692883?redirectedFrom=fulltext\n\t\t\t- limited mental model of labor\n\t- [Participatory foresight and reflexive innovation: setting policy goals and developing strategies in a bottom-up, mission-oriented, sustainable way](https://eujournalfuturesresearch.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40309-021-00171-6)\n\t\t- EXHIBIT, METHOD\n\t\t- We might further consider how narrative generation can facilitate in bringing lofty, but ambiguous, goals back within the sphere of everyday life. In so doing, these stories can utilize various concepts (technological, legal, organizational, etc.) to illustrate how a future imaginary might impact the life choices and daily routines of a vibrant citizenry.\n\t- Technology of the Oppressed: Inequity and the Digital Mundane in Favelas of Brazil\n\t\t- inspiration for speculative design process probably....Mundane Technology\n\t\t- Scholars and technology designers have often perceived the oppressed as mere consumers of technologies rather than as agents empowered by them (Rangaswamy and Cutrell 2012). This tension between oppression and empowerment turns digital technologies‚Äîas with every aspect of the life of the oppressed‚Äîinto a site of struggle, revealing the structural violence of the information age. Rendering such oppression visible makes it available for intervention and change (Eubanks 2012). After seeing how his neighborhood was framed online, Pedro became more aware of the biases of digital platforms. But in order for people like him to survive, they need to consciously resist oppressions and appropriate technology rather than reject it.\n\t\t- Technology is not a separate world‚Äîit is an extension of the struggles we all face. Thus, in this book, I explore ==how people critically appropriate technologies to navigate both digital and nondigital sources of oppression==. To guide this exploration, I borrow Paulo Freire‚Äôs notion of oppression, which he defines as acts of exploitation and violence and a failure ‚Äúto recognize others as persons‚Äù (2000, 55). Over the course of the book, I will evolve and mature Freire‚Äôs rather vague notion of oppression, building a framework around the challenges that favela residents encounter. This framework represents how I understand the role of digital technologies in favelas: Residents grapple with daily challenges from specific axes of oppression in their lives. ==Appropriating Mundane Technologies is their act of hope; they use technology to seek liberation.== Therefore, we need to shift our understanding of the role of technology in oppressive situations.\n\t\t- Freire‚Äôs invitation to others to reinvent his ideas inspired me to develop a framework that seeks to understand why digital technologies can be simultaneously sites of oppression and tools that can be appropriated by the oppressed in their pursuit of freedom. I use the term Mundane Technology to describe this framework. It doesn‚Äôt provide a method or a set of techniques to liberate the oppressed, nor it is a pedagogical plan. Rather, I conceptualize Mundane Technology as an episteme to understand oppression and Freire‚Äôs process of conscientiza√ß√£o in the information age. Similar to Virginia Eubanks and her arguments in Digital Dead End (2012), I believe that oppression should be the central diagnostic for technology. Using oppression as an outcome of concern allows us to see complex processes of exploitation, marginalization, powerlessness, cultural imperialism, and violence as centrally driving inequities of the information age.

The codes offered a starting point for a theoretically informed textual analysis: allowing us to identify the things that people say about connectivity: both how they broadly envision it, and how they enact it in their everyday business practices.\n\t\t- All relevant sections of interviews were then reread to identify key discursive formations(4) (after Rose, 2001) and regimes of truth(5) (after Gill, 1996) that were being made persuasive.\n\t\t- Three broad themes emerged‚Äîthe global village, shrinking distance, and digital augmentations‚Äîthat broadly map onto key moments in the geographic literature on technology and connectivity.

Respondents are offered a series of questions or a set of scenarios with which they can choose to agree or disagree, and they are asked to elaborate on their remarks in written responses that provide insights into challenges and opportunities of the digital future at the time of each study. T\n\t\t- Examples\n\t\t\t- The Metaverse\n\t\t\t\t- _**The question:**¬†Considering what you know about the metaverse, which statement comes closer to your view about its likely evolution by 2040?_-   _By 2040 the metaverse WILL or WILL NOT be a much-more-refined and truly fully-immersive, well-functioning aspect of daily life for a half billion or more people globally._\n\t\t\t\t- The follow-up quantitative research questions were: Please elaborate on your answer. Tell us how you imagine that this shift of many online activities into more-fully-immersive digital spaces and digital life is likely to take place. Regardless of how you see the timing of this, how might it change human society? What are the likely positives of this transition? What negatives may emerge? How might it change the daily lives of the connected? And how will this transition change the way we think about our world and ourselves? We are also interested in hearing your thoughts about the role blockchain and its applications might play in this evolution of online life by 2040.\n\t\t\t- Hopes for Digital Life in 2035\n\t\t\t\t- The *entirety* of this particular report is based upon these participants‚Äô responses to the following prompt, which was the final question of several that were asked of this group:\n\t\t\t\t\t- We invite you to imagine a better world online: What is one example of an aspect of digital life that you think could be different in 2035 than it is today? We invite you to create a vignette of something you would like to see taking place in a ‚Äúnew and improved‚Äù digital realm in 2035. Your example might involve politics or social activities or jobs or physical and mental health or community life or education. Feel free to think expansively and specifically.\n\t\t\t\t- In order to understand the context of these responses, it is important to note that participants were asked to respond to the following sets of questions before the question that generated the answers covered in this report\n\t\t\t\t\t- The evolution of digital spaces by 2035: This canvassing of experts is prompted by debates about the evolution of digital spaces and whether online life is moving in a positive or negative direction when it comes to the overall good of society. Some analysts and activists are fearful about the trajectory of digital activities; others are less concerned about the things that are happening. So, we start with a question about the way you see things evolving.\n\t\t\t\t\t- The question: Considering the things you see occurring online, which statement comes closer to your view about the evolution of digital spaces: \n\t\t\t\t\t\t- Digital spaces are evolving in ways that are both positive and negative. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t- Digital spaces are evolving in a MOSTLY POSITIVE way that is likely to lead to a BETTER future for society. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t- Digital spaces are evolving in a MOSTLY NEGATIVE way that is likely to lead to a WORSE future for society. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t- Digital spaces are not evolving in one direction or another.\n\t\t\t\t- The following quantitative prompt and research questions of this study were:\n\t\t\t\t\t- Bettering the digital public sphere: An Atlantic Monthly piece by Anne Applebaum and Peter Pomerantsev, ‚ÄúHow to Put Out Democracy‚Äôs Dumpster Fire,‚Äù provides an overview of the questions that are being raised about the tone and impact of digital life: How much harm does the current online environment cause?

Recently, there is greatly increased attention to the ways that ==technology design, development, and deployment often reproduce existing forms of inequality.==3 There is a growing conversation about persistent gender and racial disparity in Silicon Valley.4 The use of ‚ÄúBig Data‚Äù across many areas of life has civil rights implications;5 for example, investigative reporting by ProPublica exposed algorithmic bias in predictive sentencing software, and highlighted racial inequality in the distribution of technological harms and benefits.6 Department of Homeland Security requests for software companies to help develop ‚Äúgood immigrant/bad immigrant‚Äù sorting software is feeding a debate about the ethical responsibilities of technology developers.7 Social media has become a terrain riddled with trolls, botnets, clickbait, and disinformation campaigns; some operate with political objectives, others for profit, and some just for the fun of it (or all of the above).\n\t- Filipino cultural values\n\t\t- Bahala na\n\t\t\t- Negative: Ganyan talaga ng buhay\n\t\t\t\t- Filipino resilience\n\t\t\t- Positive: risk taking; radical imagination?\n\t\t- relate to our acceptance of the status quo a.k.a. technological inequity\n\t\t\t- connect to digital justice perception survey\n\t- Design\n\t\t- Design for the unreal world\n\t\t\t- How might I use unreality to question the authority of a specific reality?\n\t\t- Liberatory Design\n\t\t\t- History is a series of design decisions\n\t\t\t- Systems produce what they were designed to produce.\n\t\t\t- Everything is by design.\n\t\t\t- We are ALL designers.\n\t\t- design justice\n\t\t\t- how does design reproduce and/or challenge inequities?\n\t\t\t- The point of this story is to provide a small but concrete example from my own daily lived experience of how ==larger systems‚Äî including norms, values, and assumptions‚Äî are encoded in and reproduced through the design of sociotechnical systems,==\n\t\t\t- Utopia v.s. dystopia\n\t\t\t\t- Popular narratives of design, technology, and social change are dominated by techno- utopian hype about ever- more- powerful per-sonal devices, ‚Äúintelligent‚Äù systems, and ‚ÄúTwitter revolutions,‚Äù on the one hand, and totalizing, pessimistic accounts of digital surveillance, disinformation, and algorithmic injustice, on the other.\n\t\t\t- My broader goal is to advance the growing conversation about the pitfalls and possibilities of design as a tool for social transformation.\n\t\t\t- designers need to explicitly identify disadvantage and oppression, call it out and act upon it. This requires designers to actively address issues of marginalisation and oppression in their designs:\n\t\t\t- The goal of this book is to ==spur our imaginations about how to move beyond a system of technology design largely orga-nized around the reproduction of the matrix of domination.==\n\t\t- ¬†Anti-Oppressive Design\n\t\t\t- an approach that considers both the values embedded in technological design and the environment that surrounds how a technology is built and researched.\n\t\t\t- Aorta Collective‚Äôs Iceberg of Oppression ![[images/Pasted image 20221206233725.png]]\n\t\t\t- By visiting the Hollaback site, the women were able to ==problematize their experiences.== By reading each others stories, they were able to u==nderstand harassment as a problem, rather than as a norm.== Usually, problematizing an issue is the work of social movement leaders‚Äîin this case, the ==stories were doing the transformation.==\n\t\t\t- This is called a \"frame transformation,‚Äù a cognitive and emotional shift in how people understood and felt about their experiences.\n\t- My personal experiences with tech\n\t\t- ive written about maintenance work, fast food education, and web3\n\t\t- from engaging with tech communities to interning and freelancing for companies\n\t- cite PH tech issues? affects of colonialism and capitalism\n\t\t- The Philippines as a hub for providing human capital: BPO industry and digital platforms -\u003e labor inequalities\n\t\t\t- digital colonialism (see Make Space for Maintenance and [[Miscellaneous Notes/Daily Notes/2022-10-30]])\n\t\t- reliance on foreign technologies and software, affected by foreign-oriented economic policies \n\t\t- sweaty startup guy\n\t\t\t- https://twitter.com/sweatystartup/status/1480161176797552640\n\t- Examples\n\t\t- Digital Justice Perception Survey\n\t\t\t- despite users professing to be literate, their actions say otherwise (i.e. carelessness with social media usage)\n\t\t- The Missing Economy of the Philippines\n\t\t\t- the most prominent tech firms that are operating in today's landscape are not founded and headquartered in the Philippines E.G. e-commerce\n\t\t\t- monopoly problem\n\t\t\t\t- even though we may have our own disruptive businesses, they are still far from changing the status quo of who is rich. Conglomerates still reign\n\t\t\t\t- e.g. prominent fintech players like GCash and Maya\n\t\t\t- the PH is a crypto-attached nation\n\t\t\t\t- some of the highest adopters of crypto coins, and largest players of crypto-based games like Axie Affinity\n\t\t- History of Philippine digitalization\n\t\t\t- The lost momentum to industrialize, along with economic policies that are foreign-oriented, caused the Philippines to become dependent on the service industry. The lack of national industry and grand political plan to do so lead the Philippine ICT to be highly reliant on foreign technologies and software which has a negative impact on the pace of current digitalization in the Philippines.\n\t\t- Digital labor bayanihan\n\t\t\t-  example of a Filipino cultural value that shapes the collective ‚Äúanchoring‚Äù of digital platform workers to survive a precarious digital market. \n\t\t\t- Digital labor influencers also serve as promoters of the Philippine government‚Äôs vision of promoting Filipinos as ‚Äúworld class workers‚Äù (imaginary) while allowing it (along with digital platforms) to avoid its responsibility to attend to the deeper structures of labor inequality.\n\t\t- Student Startup Ecosystem studies\n\t\t\t- For many Filipino students, dream career prospects end at Accenture (now with several offices across the Philippines) or at multinational pharmaceutical companies. While there is a growing entrepreneurial culture, tech isn't associated with the majority of small businesses--the startup scene is still rudimentary. For students, the lack of role models and introduction to alternative career prospects from the dominant monopolies, contributing to lack of entrepreneurial talent.\n\t\t\t- When technology is powered by the few, what happens?\n\t\t\t\t- In its current state, emerging markets must reject the same mistakes that Silicon Valley had welcomed in to invest in their own growth. Regulators and policymakers must step in to help local economies flourish, while also putting constraints on technologists. Cross-pollinators and¬†balikbayans¬†must be wary of tech saviourism and 'heropreneurship', especially when entirely unaware that the practices they parrot from Silicon Valley will few times suffice in their home country. While success breeds more success in the near-term, understanding the cultural and long-term impact of the products and economic models we breed is critical‚Äì‚Äìand we already have years of development ahead to forewarn us.\n\t\t\t- Idol worship\n\t\t\t- bayanihan seen in the community building of grassroots technology nonprofits and community organizers\n- Objectives of the Project\n\t- after listing the objectives, write paragraphs breaking down each one\n\t- perhaps explain how my tracks (information design and comptuer science)\n\t- Main question ideas:\n\t\t- How can we foster Filipinos' critical consciousness of technology? So that we can encourage a more equitable technological future for the Philippines? \n\t\t- How can we spur  Filipino imaginations about how to move beyond inequitable technological presents?\n\t\t- How can we cultivate Filipinos' critical questioning of technology through design?\n\t\t\t- How can we cultivate Filipinos' critical inquiry competence of technology?\n\t\t- How can we trigger critical thinking in Filipinos when it comes to technology?\n\t\t- How can we build Filipinos' critical consciousness about technological futures?\n\t\t- Solution: through a design provocation\n\t- Critical consciousness\n\t\t- Critical consciousness calls attention to how learning involves an awareness of understanding how inequality operates in society, including its structural roots, and the agency to engage in action toward social transformation. \n- Definition of Terms\n\t- a set of beliefs, institutions, laws, and symbols common to a particular social group and its corresponding society.

The evolving digital cultures in the Global South vividly demonstrate that there are more ways than one to imagine what digital practice and global connection could look like.\n\t- a powerful overview of the ways that technological innovation often happens on the margins of society, far from the inno-vation hubs imagined and created by city planners, state officials, and private sector investors. She describes how digital cultures that emerge organically from the peripheries, including in the Global South, are different from those produced via the universalizing imaginary of tech-nosolutionists who operate from positions of great power.\n\t- What work do universalisms do? That is how do they shape our understanding of networks and more broadly social, political and cultural change? Chan suggests that ==the way¬†**digital futures**¬†are imagined, narrated and created‚Äîthrough assumptions about innovation, progress, technologies agency ‚Äì are limited by these universal attributes and affordances of technology.==\n\t- To disrupt these, she posits an ethnographic methodology that emphasize ‚Äúvibrant micronarratives and situated stories around ==IT and innovation culture==‚Äù (xi) Specifically she wants to chart how these unhinge grand narratives of progress that are the foundation of these universalisms around technology. She examines how information technologies have become a shorthand for ‚Äúimagining global connection‚Äù (xiii) and in doing so seeks to undo the ‚Äúcontext-erasing‚Äù (5) accounts that have so far been the dominant trend in studies of global networks and information technologies.\n\t- ‚Äúthe imaginaries and innovations that underpin digital culture and surround networked connections‚Äù\n\t- The¬†**‚Äúmyth of digital universalism‚Äù**¬†manifests not only in the means by which it¬†**keeps public narratives and imaginations fixed exclusively**¬†**around**¬†so-called¬†**‚Äúcentres‚Äù of innovation**, but in the means by which it¬†**simultaneously discourages attention to digital dynamics**¬†beyond such centres‚Äîa dynamic conjuring colonial relations to data and the periphery that reporters and scholars of global digital cultures alike must be wary of reproducing.\n\t- Global imaginaries around IT in the new millennium, after all, have made Silicon Valley hackers, the obsessions and aspirations of high-tech engineers, and the strategic enterprise of competitive technology entrepreneurs, the stuff of popular Hollywood films and obsessively followed Twitter accounts. These are a cast of increasingly recognizable actors, heroes and villains.\n\t- Far from merely lagging behind or mimicking centres, dynamic activities from the periphery suggest how¬†**agents once holding minor status can emerge**¬†instead as fresh sources of distinct productivity. Their diverse threads unsettle the unspoken presumption that a single, universal narrative could adequately represent the distinct digital futures and imaginaries emerging across a range of local sites today\n\t- ‚Äúdigital universalist‚Äù models (Chan, 2014) that ==problematically elevate narrow versions of Western and elite digital practice and innovation as the only relevant pathway to the future==\n\t- Imagining technological futures withand in between the interfaces of the diverse forms of knowledge practice that come alive among them ‚Äìand that can come together across differences, rather than in spite of it ‚Äìinstead becomes a key resource for imagining new digital futures (Tsing, 2005).\n- Sustainable Technological Futures: Moving beyond a One-World-World perspective\n\t- In this critique, we ==problematize the framing of technological futures== in design and computing discourse through rhetorical devices such as the Futures Cone which we contend promotes a one-world-world perspective, in that it assumes a ==collective (western) acceptance of a particular historicity and notions of time and progress.== This perspective currently dominates the practical design and implementation of many new technological devices and systems.\n- Problematize cont.\n\t- Abstract 2 points towards the necessity of AI systems to provide meaningful explanations for their behavior and that currently ‚Äúexplanations are predominantly implemented after the fact.‚Äù Concerning this matter, the authors problematize ‚Äútechno-centric engineering processes and development teams that lack diversity and empathy.‚Äù\n- https://www.academia.edu/39021258/The_limits_of_the_imaginary_Challenges_to_raising_critical_consciousness_about_datafication_and_algorithmic_archiving\n\t- encourage people to imagine future possibilites\n\t- challenge: getting people to actually imagine in ways that do not reproduce current ideological trends or cede control/power to external stakeholders\n\t- hegemonic ideology of pwoer and control\n\t- goals:\n\t\t- to penetrate and disrupt both learned and tacit frames\n\t\t- to enable people to start thinking critically\n\t\t- to build new pathways for thinking\n\t- ACS functions\n\t\t- First, to ask participants to think about ==‚ÄòWhat is going on here?‚Äô== in relation to how their data is being formulated, stored, and fed back to them through various platforms and digital service infrastructures. This question (What is going on here?) is not stated as much as it is ==provoked==, which means essentially that we want participants to raise the question themselves.\n\t\t- This more open-ended goal was accompanied by an interventionist, critical pedagogy goal, inspired by a second question, ==‚ÄòShouldn‚Äôt we be more engaged in actively creating rather than simply accepting the future?‚Äô== and ‚ÄòOn what level might we be actually ‚Äòworld-making‚Äô as we engage in the mundane, the banal, the playful acts of everyday conversation and digital media use? \n\t\t- Therefore, each workshop tested a different set of techniques to prompt participants to ==dig beneath the surface of activities to identify some of the implicit assumptions and premises informing these actions. And then build some imaginariesof their own.==\n\t\t\t- 1st objectives: dig deep to identify implicit assumptions and premises that inform their actions\n\t\t\t- 2nd objectives: surface these imaginaries through design\n\t\t- How can design interventions help push the limits of public imagination to think in truly alternative ways about their futures?\n- Critically Conscious Computing\n\t- Computer science (CS) is often taught as a utopian discipline, full of powerful abstractions that can transform lives and society for the better. However, as computing has reshaped every part of society in both highly visible and highly invisible ways, it has become clear that the foundational ideas in CS carry explicit values: ones of automation, replacement, standardization, centralization, and amplification. These values have positioned it as a discipline of power, and due to the ignorance with which it is often applied, often one of oppression. In this book, we reconsider the technical and pedagogical foundations of CS and CS education from this lens, and offer teaching methods for secondary education that ==foster students‚Äô critical consciousness of computing, with the hope of fostering a more equitable, culturally sustaining, and just future of computing.==\n\t- Introduction\n\t\t- CS teaching, therefore, naturally gravitates toward these utopian narratives.\n\t\t- This uncritical view of CS is far from just an incomplete story ‚Äî for many, it is becoming an invisible crisis of injustice and oppression.\n\t\t- Our focus is therefore adolescents, and on a counter narrative about computing that views CS as both magical, but also fraught. It simultaneously examines the racist, sexist, ableist, classist reality of our global society, and demonstrates how CS is often used to amplify and reinforce these forms of oppression in daily life. It shows how only certain people experience the utopian narrative of CS, and those that do go on to perpetuate this narrative in higher education and industry, systematically and often unintentionally excluding those who were never included. It positions students as agents of social change, both in how they use computing, but also in whether they use it, and to what end. This is a book for secondary CS educators who want to develop the agency and skills to ==catalyze social change though their students.==\n\t- CS, Equity, and Justice\n\t\t- Computing is not neutral; it is imbued with the values of its creators.\n\t\t- Teachers can build students‚Äô critical consciousness of computing, equity, and justice by linking the injustices in their lives to the technology in their lives.\n\t\t- Raising questions about how computing does harm is an opportunity to talk about more equal, equitable, and just futures, and reposition computing from a technology that is neutral or in the way, to a technology that might be harnessed for justice.\n- Apparudai on global cultural flows\n\t- the world we live in today is characterized by a new role for the imagination in social life\n\t- the imagination as social practice: an organized field of social practices, a forom of work, and a form of negotiation between sites of agency and globally defined fieds of possibilties\n\t- the imagination is now central to all forms of agency, is itself a social fact, and is the key component of the new global order\n- STEPWISE Science Education on Sociotechnical Imaginaries\n\t- This video is intended to be used by teachers to introduce students to the concept of sociotechnical imaginaries (SIs) - which are sets of values, principles, etc. that guide assemblage of many living and non-living actants into a dispositif (network of actants) that generally promotes said values, principles, etc. Such teaching can help students to more fully understand relationships among fields of science \u0026 technology and societies \u0026 environments (STSE) and sociopolitical actions to try to overcome harms in such relationships. \n\t- [Teacher Intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_kd8JXncRM)\n\t\t- Example SIs\n\t\t\t- ![[images/Pasted image 20221206033555.png]]\n\t\t\t- ![[images/Pasted image 20221206033631.png]]\n\t\t\t- ![[images/Pasted image 20221206033655.png]]\n\t- [Teacher-Input](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxIQ1Povp_0)\n\t\t- Introduction ![[images/Pasted image 20221206032717.png]]\n\t\t- Case Study on Lumosity\n\t\t\t- ![[images/Pasted image 20221206032935.png]]\n\t\t\t- ![[images/Pasted image 20221206033218.png]]\n\t- [Teacher Input \u0026 Student Applications](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXfP3YnAIaI)\n\t\t- The problem ![[images/Pasted image 20221206034418.png]]\n\t\t- Emotions as stakeholders ![[images/Pasted image 20221206034510.png]]\n\t\t- ![[images/Pasted image 20221206034717.png]]\n\t\t- ![[images/Pasted image 20221206034753.png]]\n\t\t- ![[images/Pasted image 20221206034824.png]]\n\n\n\u003e This talk will address the potential for the imaginary as a design tool for social change.

Sorry for not getting back to you these past few months. I've been delayed by a lot of difficulties in my personal life, along with excruciating perfectionism; it took me forever to not only figure out what topic I wanted to share, but also select the best resources to feature. I hope the effort I put into answering these questions makes up for it, though! Thank you again for the opportunity :)\n\n### Questions\n**Topic Name:**\n- Non-Western Product and Service Design\n- Or Cross-Cultural Design\n\n**Why is XX topic interesting?**¬†(100-150 words)\nWhen I was getting started with product and service design, I was stuck in a Western bubble; the practitioners I first looked up to tended to be white males, while the platforms I would refer to as examples usually came from Silicon Valley.  However, design isn't fully universal; just because an app succeeds in America doesn't mean it'll do as well in Southeast Asia. A significant chunk of Internet users belong to the Majority World/Global South, yet there is so little we know about them. As a Filipino woman myself, I struggled to figure out how to adapt my design practice to my own local context, and I feel like I'm still learning. Hence why I want to advocate for this topic. I have compiled resources on how to practice cross-cultural design alongside various examples of technology in non-Western countries.\n  \n\n**A podcast worth listening to on the topic?**¬†¬†(with 1-2 sentences on why)\nI highly recommend [Traces](https://open.spotify.com/show/29LXWjJOJoBmaEaMevtvi6?si=1179809d99bf41ce): a podcast that dissects how technology and design impacts culture in developing countries (currently focused on Myanmar).\n\n**Things worth reading and watching on the topic?**¬†(with 1-2 sentences on why)\nFirst, here are some of the books I find essential:\n- [Cross-Cultural Design](https://abookapart.com/products/cross-cultural-design): Designer and creative director Senongo Akpem shares a clear and accessible methodology for designing across cultures: from performing socially conscious research, to building culturally responsive experiences, to developing meaningful internationalization and localization approaches.\n- [The Next Billion Users](https://www.amazon.com/Next-Billion-Users-Digital-Beyond/dp/0674983785): Digital anthropologist Payal Arora invalidates  multiple assumptions about internet use in developing countries by sharing insights from her extensive fieldwork in India, China, South Africa, Brazil, and the Middle East.\nNext, here are some of the online resources I constantly refer to:\n- [Web Design Across the World](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/series/web-design-across-the-world--cms-1038):  This series of articles exposes global web culture, technology, education, and design, one country at a time.\n- [Inclusive Design in Southeast Asia](https://www.projectlima.co/inclusive-design-southeast-asia/): This study explores how far Southeast Asia organizations incorporate inclusiveness and accessibility¬†into their digital products.\nFinally, a case study that has left a big impact on me is [Designing for Developing Markets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unCYqNmg7tI): a talk where Jay Demetillo, Lead Product Designer of Grab, shows how he strategizes, researches, and designs for different regions, discussing everything from ideologies to design systems.\n\t\n**Projects worth following on the topic?**¬†(with 1-2 sentences on why)\nTwo projects that I'm excited by so far are:\n- [Chamjo](https://chamjo.design/): Created by an all-Indonesian team, this Mobbin-inspired collection consists of design patterns used by Asia-based apps. \n- [AI in/from the Majority World](https://points.datasociety.net/ai-in-the-global-south-sites-and-vocabularies-e3b67d631508): This project by Data \u0026 Society invigorates existing efforts to reframe the \"Global South\" as home to the majority of the human population, while aiming to understand the diverse ethics, politics, and everyday experiences of living with data and AI. So far, this project has come up with a primer on various jargons and an anthology of parables. \n\nAside from these, I have also gained unique insights from the following publications:\n- [Rest of World](https://restofworld.org/): a global nonprofit publication covering technology beyond the Western bubble.\n- [Chaoyang Trap](https://chaoyangtrap.house/): a newsletter about everyday life on the Chinese internet\n\n\n\n### Dump\n- 99% Invisible\n\t- Person in Lotus Position\n\t- \"Big Ear\" Phone Shelters - Brazil\n\t- Balikbayan Boxes - Philippines\n- Publications\n\t- Kontinentalist\n\t\t- https://kontinentalist.com/stories/air-conditioning-in-southeast-asia-is-worsening-climate-change\n\t\t- https://kontinentalist.com/stories/covid-fake-news-and-social-media-in-asia\n\t\t- https://kontinentalist.com/stories/how-online-delivery-in-asia-hurts-essential-workers-and-the-environment\n\t- Rest of World\n\t\t- https://restofworld.org/2021/the-revolutionary-mission-to-decolonize-chinese-typefaces/\n\t\t- https://restofworld.org/2020/rebuilding-gaza-with-minecraft/\n\t\t- Tech Markets: https://restofworld.org/series/tech-markets/\n- Designing a super app for the cultural diversity across southeast Asia: In this talk, Keith Vaz, Manyu Varma, and Ronak Mokashi from Gojek talks through their journey of building an umbrella brand, a cohesive design system for 20+ products, and the lessons they‚Äôve learned along the way.\n- Designing for healthcare in India: In this talk, Daniel and Mahima of Simple discuss their UX approach, prototyping and testing, and how they‚Äôve succeeded so far in helping 1.8 million people with chronic disease to get better care.\n- [Kontinenalist](https://www.kontinentalist.com/): publication creating simple, powerful data stories about Asia.\n- Technology of the Oppressed\n- Networking Peripheries\n\n- [Between the Binary](https://open.spotify.com/show/6MW2vnMh50ppvZPIwfxEj5):¬†  This limited series podcast highlights the priorities, prospects, and challenges of technology in the Global South through the voices of experts in and from the Global South.\n- [Next Billion Users](https://nextbillionusers.google/research/): This global user research initiative by Google aims to investigate more on what people everywhere need to effectively navigate the internet (not associated with Arora's book).","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T15:56:57.0001364Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2023-01-25":{"title":"2023-01-25","content":"## Historical and Philosophical Foundations of Education: Education in Ancient Times\n#EDUC101i #education #history #philosophy \n### Framing History\nWhen reviewing history, it's quite easy to get lost in the details, most specially when you are reviewing years and/or decades worth of documentation. Therefore, it's often helpful to know what you are looking for. In this course, we will review the following features in each of the eras that we will investigate:\n- **üéØ AIM:** pertains to the underlying ==purpose, philosophy or ideology== of education. *What is the purpose of education? What was education for?*\n- **üè´ TYPE:** refers to the ==various forms== in which education appears within a ==given society or culture== (e.g., moral instruction, vocational training, physical education, military or civic training). *What were the formal and/or informal types of education present?*\n- **üìñ CONTENT:** emphasizes the ==selection of traditions, experiences, learnings, skills, crafts, or group activities thought to be valuable within a culture== and made the basis for formal or informal education. *What was included/excluded in the the types of education?*\n- **üë®‚Äçüè´üë™ AGENCY:** pertains to the ==specific influence== of the clan, the tribe or nation, the home (including parental instruction), the church or other religious orientation, apprenticeship, the formal school, or the society itself. *Who were the \"influencers\" of education in that time?*\n- **üéì ORGANIZATION:** refers to the ==various gradations, and age levels== within the educational system. *How was education organized?*\n- **üôãMETHOD:** includes the ==devices, procedures, or direction== of the formal school as well as the more ==informal influences of society, culture, or politics.== *How did education happen?*\n\n### Education in Ancient China\n#### Geography Matters\n##### Geography as Context\n- One way to understand an educational system is to investigate the **context** that brought about its development. One way to investigate context is to begin by looking at **geography**. \n- How do you think China's geography helped \"map out\" (pun intended) its educational system?\n- Video: https://youtu.be/TSp3DeNdDzU\n\t-  What can you say about the geography of China?\n\t- How do you think did China's geographic features influence or define its educational system?\n\t- How about the Philippines? Do you think that our educational system is influenced by our geography? Why? Why not? (If you answered no, what would be changes in our educational system if it were?)\n\n##### China: Molding the future upon the past\nThe previous  video illustrates how contextual factors influence the different facets of  an educational system.  The geographic features of China ==isolated== it from other regions. Consequently, the Chinese became ==self-sufficient== and learned to ==value collectivism.==\n\n###### One of the First \"Influencers\"\n- The concept of education in ancient China was mostly based on the teaching and writings of Confucius (Links to an external site.), a leader, philosopher, teacher and political figure. Therefore, one of the best ways to understand Ancient Chinese Education is to understand where Confucius is coming from.\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFt_VGG0kJU\n\t- In a warring world, Confucius exemplified benevolence and integrity.\n\t- Because of his difficult circumstances (i.e. father dying early, having to support disabled family), Confucius developed a lifelong sympathy for the suffering of the common people.\n\t- Confucius was inspired by ancient relics, even if they were considered by many as irrelevant.\n\t- He came to believe that human character is formed in the family and by education in ritual, literature, and history. A person cultivated in this way works to help others, guiding them by moral inspiration rather than brute force.\n\t- He struggled to find a ruler who aligned with his morals. In accordance with his philosophy, and contrary to the practice of the time, Confucius dissuaded rulers from relying on harsh punishments and military power to govern their lands. This is because he believed that a good leader inspires others to spontaneously follow him by virtue of his ethical charisma.\n\t- Confucius also believed that because the love and respect we learn in the family are fundamental to all other virtues, personal duties to family sometimes supersede obligations to the state.\n\t- Despite the struggles he went through, he believed that heaven had a plan for the world, and that a person could always find joy in learning and music.\n\t- \"Do not inflict upon others that which you yourself would not want.\"\n- **üéØ AIM: What was the Aim of Ancient Chinese Education?**\n\t- Education in Ancient China was aimed to preserve and perpetuate ==traditional beliefs, customs and way of life.== The Chinese believed that education was an instrument to secure ==social stability== by \"preserving the past\".   Hence, ideals and beliefs were the same from generation to generation. Life was crystallized in fixed forms. \n\t- Another  important educational aim in ancient China was to prepare its citizen for the [civil examination](https://www.ancient.eu/article/1335/the-civil-service-examinations-of-imperial-china/).  Being successful in these examinations provided opportunities for positions in government as well as achieving a higher status in life.\n- **üè´ TYPE: What was the type of education?**\n\t- To support these educational aims, ==moral training== was given emphasis.  Moral training  did not refer to right or wrong (as we know it now) but rather to the idea of of noble living.  \n\t- Noble living meant valuing the [five relationships](https://prezi.com/33o0lrhkpeow/the-five-relationships/) and following the [five cardinal virtues](http://www.goolevalve.com/news/news-detail-195.html). Vocational and domestic training were also highly valued.  Boys were taught trade skills while domestic skills were developed among the girls. \n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23095578/214774293-50d83833-acb6-4333-838a-0534efdc0457.png)\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23095578/214770589-12359c1e-d16b-4c93-8d2a-85659e163932.png)\n\n- **üìñ CONTENT**\n\t- The content of education were the [Five Classics and the Four Books](https://academics.hamilton.edu/asian_studies/home/culttemp/sitePages/fiveclassics.html).  These writings were the main content of the examinations. In the examinations, students had to show that they've memorized these texts.\n\nIn the text above, I gave you a head start by providing an overview of the aims, type and content of Ancient Chinese Education. How about üë®‚Äçüè´üë™ AGENCY, üéì ORGANIZATION and üôãMETHOD?\n- To dig deeper into how Ancient Chinese Education was like, read p.21-28 of this excerpt on Ancient Chinese Education:\n\t- AIMS\n\t- AGENCIES\n\t- ORGANIZATION\n\t\t- organized on 2 levels: (1) elementary education, exceedingly formalized and rigorous; and (2) higher education, training for the governmental tests, which formed the highest stage of the educational process\n\t\t- started at age 7\n\t\t- \"leap through the Dragon's Gate\" = gaining of  high public office through examinations and degrees; could be bestowed upon both poor and wealthy \n\t\t- Ancient Chinese education was designed for the maintenance of that which exists, without change or modification, it became the function of education to train the leaders in the knowledge of the classical learning ‚Äî all the traditional rules governing the order of society and covering the popular relationships in life ‚Äî and to train the masses in proper modes of conduct with respect to every interest and every activity throughout their entire lives.\n\t- TYPES\n\t- CONTENT \n- To aid in imagining what this might have been like, you may also want to view this [short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_ukxlUlGyI).\t\n\n###### Read and Share\n\u003e After going over the materials above, share your answers to the following questions in the Discussion Board.  Limit your answers to two to three sentences for each question.\n\u003e 1. What is the Chinese concept of learning?\n\u003e 2. What factors affected educational opportunities in China?\n\n1. The Chinese equated the act of learning to memorization. This is because the morals they aspired to develop in their educational system were merely seen as a matter of knowledge; after all, truth is what has simply been agreed on in the past, and virtue was an observance of those fixed ideas and customs. This perception is reflected in exceedingly formalized education and reliance on classical readings.\n2. Some factors that affected educational opportunities in China were gender and socioeconomic class. Private schools and public examinations were only open to males, but preparation for these examinations required much leisure time that only those of higher classes could afford to spend.\n\n##### Ancient Chinese Education Today\n- Now that you have a better grasp of what Ancient Chinese Education may have been like, let's make some connections to present day practice.\n- [Education for children on Chinese traditional culture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSVMzBFRhsQ)\n\t- The video above shows how ancient educational practices are still given premium in contemporary education in China.¬†¬†_If we look beyond China, do we also see a semblance of such practices?

In a nutshell, it's a genre defined by¬†**fictional elements that are rooted in scientific principles while still being impossible according to our current understanding and/or deployment of those principles**, but even this definition comes with caveats and ambiguity. Whose science are we using? What does \"impossible\" mean? How much can we bend scientific theory before we leave science fiction altogether and enter the realm of fantasy?\n- This is not a course whose goal is to give you definitive answers to any of those questions. This is a course founded on appreciation, discussion, and critique, which means ==treating gray areas not as problems to be solved, but as territory to be explored==.\n- Historically, science fiction has many ancestors, chief among them ==mythology==--the stories used by ancient civilizations to attempt to explain the workings of the universe. While we now refer to these as fantastical narratives, to ancient peoples, these were the result of earnest, rational striving using the tools they had at the time in order to ==explain phenomena for which they had no definitive answers==--in short, early forerunners of science and science fiction. \n- Later on, as ==political, utopia, and enlightenment stories== emerged throughout human history, they too displayed characteristics we now associate with science fiction, centering such concepts as ==alternative visions of society== and the ==primacy of human reason== in shaping and understanding the world.\n- One important thing to remember is that¬†**science fiction stories are as much about the present as they are about the future.**¬†Science fiction exists at the ==intersection of possibility and critique:== we imagine it out of our dreams of the future as much as we extrapolate it from the realities of the present. When Orwell wrote¬†_1984_, he was both speculating on how technology might enable a government to spy on and control its people as much as he was commenting on the surveillance state that already existed in the United States as he was writing. This can inflect science fiction with hope and darkness in equal parts: the bright spots we see in the present, as well as the problems, can all be amplified and hyperbolized through the lens of future society and technology.\n- The perspective of science fiction, thus, is that ==we carry our present into the future.== ==Reason and human agency and causality==, not destiny or prophecy or the associative logic of magic, are the driving engines of reality; science fiction holds that ==the universe can be understood, that history makes sense, and that logic is the ordering principle of narrative== (even if it's a logic we do not currently understand).\n\n#### Darko Suvin: \"On the Poetics of the Science Fiction Genre\"\n- Suvin's definition of science fiction hinges on two key descriptors.\n\t- First, he describes science fiction as a genre that¬†**\"takes off from a ==fictional (‚Äòliterary‚Äô) hypothesis ==and develops it with ==extrapolating and totalizing (‚Äòscientific‚Äô) rigor.==\"**¬†\n\t\t- Science fiction asks the question¬†_**what if**_, creates hypotheses that bear some kind of ==social, cultural, or symbolic resonance== (e.g. \"what if capitalism literally forced you to buy more years of life\"--see the 2011 film¬†_In Time_), grounds these hypotheses in ==scientific logic== (e.g. \"capitalism forcing you to buy years of life is possible if humanity is genetically engineered a certain way), and then builds its stories from these premises. \n\t\t- At the heart of a great science fiction story is a ==resonant (\"literary\") idea==, built up with the ==logic of currently understood science== and turned into the engine of a narrative.\n\t- Suvin further writes that ‚Äúthe effect of such factual reporting of fictions is one of¬†**confronting a set normative system‚Ä¶ with a point of view or glance implying a new set of**¬†**norms.**\" \n\t\t- Here, the \"set normative system\" is the ==\"real world,\"== the context in which the author and reader live and which the text inhabits. \n\t\t- Every fantastic fact in science fiction is an implied ==critique of reality==--if you make the sky pink on your alien planet, you implicitly ask why the sky we see¬†_isn't_¬†pink. \n\t\t- When we see a¬†_kaiju_¬†like Godzilla or a fictional alien invasion like the zerg from Starcraft, we ask ourselves how we as a society actually would react to this kind of catastrophic disaster (spoilers for the year 2020: apparently not well). \n\t\t- More realistically, a world of social control like that of Margaret Atwood's¬†_The Handmaid's Tale_¬†asks questions like, \"_**What if the sex-and-gender-based social systems that control our lives were somehow even worse and had more concrete physical manifestations?\"**_\n- Suvin anchors all this on what he terms the¬†**_[[Permanent Notes/Novum]]_**, the \"strange newness\" at the heart of a science fiction work. The¬†_novum_¬†is¬†**the fantastic element of a text, the point of difference between a science fiction text and the reality in which the text exists.**¬†\n\t- A work can, of course, have multiple¬†_nova_, ranging from people to creatures to technology to places to physical laws and phenomena. \n\t- The¬†_novum_¬†follows the logic of science fiction: in a good science fiction story, the¬†_novum_¬†has a \"literary\" resonance--it carries a kind of social, cultural, or symbolic meaning with it--but exists in the world of the story through scientific logic and rules. \n\t- When we see Godzilla, we think of a metaphor for the atom bomb, a wild force of power and destruction, but he exists in the world of the text as a mutant creature, an accident of genetics. And the best science fiction stories ==portray the metaphorical and logical sides of the¬†_novum_¬†as in harmony with each other==: Godzilla is mutated, usually, by radiation from the atom bomb, so even in the world of the text, he is the embodied power of the weapon that he represents.\n- Suvin also goes on to talk about two other principles at work in the science fiction text:¬†**[[Permanent Notes/Cognition]]**¬†and¬†**[[Permanent Notes/Estrangement]].**¬†\n\t- [[Permanent Notes/Cognition]] is our ==understanding== of something, the textual representation of our ability to recognize the ==meaning== in a symbol. \n\t- [[Permanent Notes/Estrangement]], conversely, is the ==portrayal== of something in a way that renders it ==bizarre or alien== to us (one might also call it¬†_defamiliarization_). \n\t- When we look at the¬†_novum_, or indeed at any fantastic element in speculative fiction,¬†**both cognition and estrangement**¬†are at work: we can ideally recognize what the¬†_novum_¬†represents, both in terms of symbolic meaning and scientific principle, but we can also see the ways in which the work renders it fantastic, scary, wondrous, and unreal. The creative tension between cognition and estrangement is what drives science fiction--in terms of individual text, genre as a whole, and our experience of both--forward.\n\n#### Evolution as the Framework for Science Fiction\n\u003e \"Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution.\"\n\u003e -Theodosius Dobzhansky\n\n- ^ This will be our guiding principle throughout the whole course\n- Just as evolutionary concepts inform biological studies, so do they inform the understanding of science fiction texts with biological nova.\n- [Episode 1 - Biology of Science Fiction: Cosmic Red Queen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xda7O-Fie6A)\n\t- Red Queen in *Alice in Wonderland:* \"Now, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place.\"\n\t- Red Queen hypothesis: **a species must adapt and evolve not just for reproductive advantage, but also for survival because competing organisms also are evolving**.\n\t- Evolutionary Arms Race: an ongoing struggle between¬†[competing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_(biology) \"Competition (biology)\")¬†sets of¬†[co-evolving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co-evolution \"Co-evolution\")¬†[genes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene \"Gene\"),¬†[phenotypic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotypic \"Phenotypic\")¬†and¬†[behavioral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_ecology \"Behavioral ecology\")¬†traits that develop escalating¬†[adaptations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation_(biology) \"Adaptation (biology)\")¬†and counter-adaptations against each other, resembling an¬†[arms race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arms_race \"Arms race\")\n- [Gunn - The Worldview of Science Fiction](https://www.proquest.com/openview/0037939df3181bd1f1399860ed428ef2/1?pq-origsite=gscholar\u0026cbl=1820923)\n\n**Points for Discussion:**\n1) How are Suvin's and Gunn's ideas on the science fiction genre consistent with each other? How are they conflicting?\n2) Think of a science fiction text (i.e. book, movie, anime, TV show, comics, etc.) that you know. How does evolution inform its main plot and/or characters?\n3) In her Introduction to her novel¬†_The Left Hand of Darkness, Ursula Le Guin says that \"Science fiction is not predictive; it is descriptive.\" Is this consistent with how you view science fiction? How do you relate it to Suvin's and Gunn's definitions of the genre?\n\n#### Semiotics and the Novum\n- Science fiction as a genre is highly driven by signs and symbols. We can look at Ferdinand de¬†Saussure's definition of a¬†**sign**¬†as a system of meaning consisting of a constructed relationship between a¬†**signifier**¬†(the physical form of a sign which communicates meaning) and a¬†**signified**¬†(the abstract meaning/s being communicated). \n- Because these relationships are constructed and based upon ==convention==, a signifier can have many meanings, and often we have to parse them through ==context==--the color¬†**red**¬†can be seen to represent¬†_health_¬†if seen on an apple,¬†_love_¬†if combined with the shape of an abstract cartoon heart, or¬†_caution or attention_¬†if perceived in the context of the octagon of a stop sign. We can then say that a¬†**stop sign**¬†is a¬†**sign**¬†that uses the color¬†**red**¬†as a¬†**signifier**¬†to communicate¬†**caution and attention**¬†as¬†**signified**¬†meanings. (Although it must be said that by now, the image of the stop sign is so ingrained in many of us that the signified meaning is pretty much just \"stop.\")\n- Darko Suvin's¬†_nova_¬†can be interpreted in much the same way in terms of how they operate within science fiction texts. Through the dynamics of¬†_cognition and estrangement_, a¬†_novum_¬†often ==represents a concept from reality (the signified) that is twisted into an often-literally-alien form (the signifier).== In a good science fiction work (i.e. one that integrates the¬†_novum_¬†as a core part of the text's discourse rather than simply using it as window dressing), it's often a good strategy to begin reading the work by trying to figure out what meaning/s the¬†_novum_¬†is attempting to communicate.\n- For example, the¬†**zombie,**¬†a classic monster in movies and popular culture, is often explained as the product of a virus or other infectious agent when it's in a science fiction text. The zombie virus, then, is the¬†_novum_, the science-based fictional element that makes the text a work of science fiction. \n\t- Now, depending on the specific text, zombies are often used to represent all manner of things: zombie movies set in malls often cast their zombies as mindlessly ravenous hordes against a backdrop of consumer goods, suggesting a reading based on consumerism's ability to drive us mad. \n\t- Conversely, a zombie movie where the protagonists explore a post-apocalyptic wilderness or urban landscape tends to create the feeling that the zombies involved are stand-ins for humanity in survival mode, the loss of humanity that can occur in desperate situations.\n\t- In this formulation, the¬†**sign**¬†is the¬†_novum_, the¬†**zombie plague**. \n\t- The¬†**signifier**, the concrete container and conveyor of meaning, is the science-based element of a¬†**pathogen**. \n\t- The¬†**signified**, the abstract theme/s or ideas/s that the signifier is made to represent, is¬†**consumerism or desperation--the fear of the other--**or whatever it is that the film in question wants its zombies to stand for.\n![[images/Pasted image 20230127133229.png]]\n\n- In short, a good starting point for reading a piece of science fiction might be to begin by identifying the¬†_novum_, and then trying to articulate it using a formulation like, \"The¬†_novum_¬†in this text is¬†**[sign]**, which uses¬†**[scientific grounding]**¬†as a signifier to communicate or represent¬†**[social/cultural theme/s and/or idea/s]**¬†as a signified.\" \n- It's important to note that there is even less direct correspondence of meanings between signifier and signified when we speak of the science fiction¬†_novum_¬†than there is for other signs; the metaphorization present in science fiction necessarily loses some of the meaning of the signified even as it hyperbolizes and clarifies other aspects of it. The point of science fiction is ==never to completely reproduce anything==--whether it's science or the abstract themes that it's using science to discuss--but rather to ==make us think about and appreciate the ways in which scientific theories and our conceptions about society, culture, and philosophy can inform and comment upon each other.==\n- One final note: the reason I hate the word \"symbolize\" is because it's so easy to overuse. Remember, ==a metaphor is when¬†_unlike_¬†things are compared to one another with the intention of making a point.== If a movie shows humans attacking aliens with missiles, you cannot say the missiles \"symbolize hostility\"--they're a direct consequence of hostility. Not everything is a symbol, and indeed, not every theme in a science fiction text is a direct result of its¬†_novum_¬†or¬†_nova_. Don't be too trigger-happy with your analyses.\n\n#### Language and Biology\n- One very common source of curiosity regarding non-human animals is whether or not they have or are even capable of¬†**language**. \n\t- It's interesting to note at this juncture that one way by which human language has been distinguished from other animals' modes of communication is that it is the ability to routinely invent new signs or words. That is not to say, of course, that other animals cannot read and understand signs. \n\t- There are all sorts of visual, auditory, and tactile chemical cues that animals use to understand one another, like bright colors usually meaning danger! \n\t- It's just that ==only humans may be capable of routinely inventing new signs or new meanings to existing ones.==\n- Aside from that, human language has some properties that other forms of animal communication lack. According to linguistic anthropologist Charles F. Hockett, only human language has the following features: \n\t- **displacement**¬†(communicating things that are not present)\n\t- **productivity**¬†(creating new words to add to a language, specifically to its lexicon)\n\t- **cultural transmission**\n\t- **duality**¬†(consisting of individually meaningless elements that can together form larger meaningful elements, such as sounds together making up a complete word)\n\t- **prevarication**¬†(intentionally making false or meaningless statements),¬†**reflexiveness**¬†(using language to talk about language)\n\t- **learnability** \n\t- Other features such as arbitrariness and semanticity may be present in communication among other primates or to a certain extent other animals (like dolphins, which are believed to communicate through their clicks, including unique names for one another), but ==only human language has ALL of these properties.==\n- That other animals have some form of communication is, of course, undeniable. Ants and many other insects use chemical signals in the form of pheromones. Birds use their sounds and a combination of anatomical traits and behavior, such as fluffing their feathers, to transmit a message. Cuttlefish change the color of their skin to show aggression. So that leads us to the next oft-asked question concerning language: **is intelligence necessary for the type of language that we have?** What do we even mean by intelligence and \"intelligent species,\" which is a term that we often see in science fiction?\n\t- It's not necessarily an easy question to answer. Many have linked intelligence to cognition and consciousness. \n\t- The essence of¬†**[[Cognition]]**¬†can be captured by the ==capacity for perception, thinking, memory, learning, decision-making, problem-solving, self-control, and, perhaps most importantly,¬†_prediction_.== ^cec67f\n\t\t- It has been said that only humans have a concept of the future and planning for the future. However, some recent researches such as one done in Stockholm University have shown that planning and self-control behavior can be found in some animals like ravens and the great apes, and not because of similar high-level mental faculties as humans, but through associative learning.\n\t- _**Sir AJ's Note:**_¬†This is one point in the semester where we see an interesting point of interface between biology and literature--the way we see¬†_[[Cognition]]_.  ^13f4d0\n\t\t- While Suvin agrees with the biological perspective on cognition as the ability to perceive reality through logic, he also views ==cognition as an¬†_attitude_, an¬†_approach_¬†to reality that views reality as knowable, diametrically opposed to the approach of myth, which views the world's norms as fixed, mystical, and operating on associative/symbolic logic rather than rationality¬†_per se_.== \n\t\t- There's a lot to be said here about knowledge systems and the way knowledge is constructed and how the rhetoric and language of science has been used to marginalize other systems of knowledge, but I'll stop here lest we accidentally become an epistemology course.\n- Consciousness is closely linked to [[Cognition]]. According to the physicist and futurist Michio Kaku in his book¬†_The Future of the Mind_,¬†**[[Permanent Notes/Consciousness]]**¬†is the ability to create a model of the world using multiple feedback loops in different parameters to accomplish goals. The following table shows Kaku's categorization of levels of consciousness among organisms:\n\n![[images/Pasted image 20230127133811.png]]\n\n- One can assume that the more primitive vertebrates (fish and amphibians) belong to Level I as well, and birds, which have a well-developed limbic system (that part of the brain that governs emotions, long-term memory, motivation, etc.; the amygdala, which is associated with fear, is part of this system), also are of Level II. Presumably, by Kaku's categorization, invertebrates lie somewhere between Levels 0 and I, though I would argue that by virtue of their having a centralized nervous system and the ability to move, bilaterally symmetrical invertebrates (basically all invertebrates except sponges, jellyfish, corals, and their radially symmetrical kin) have Level I consciousness.\n- The prefrontal cortex is responsible for [[Cognition]] (thus the link between cognition and consciousness!), personality expression, and the moderation of behavior according to social norms (hold onto that; we'll revisit this when we read and discuss \"Love Will Tear Us Apart\" in Module 4). Interestingly, the brain part called the Broca's Area, which is linked to speech production, is associated with the prefrontal cortex.\n- So if language and cognition are hallmarks of intelligence, then we can say that ==\"intelligent species\" that are capable of human-like language (like Klingon, for instance) have Level III consciousness...or maybe even higher?== After all, some of the most hyper-intelligent alien species in sci-fi don't bother to use conventional language as we know it.\n\t- This sets up our first major text for this course, which is the brilliant film¬†_Arrival_¬†by Denis Villeneuve. Look back at the table and see that the parameter that Level III consciousness has as its playground is¬†_time_. That's going to be useful when discussing¬†_Arrival_'s Heptapods.\n\n#### *Arrival* - The Heptapods\n- _Arrival_¬†revolves around a first-contact scenario, with an enigmatic race of aliens making themselves known to humanity but being nearly impossible to understand, with Adams playing Louise Banks, a linguist recruited by the U.S. military to try to bridge the gap. The heart of the film is ultimately Louise's struggle to understand and be understood by the aliens, as well as the ripple effects this has on both her own life and the rest of the world's response to the situation.\n- Key to our understanding of¬†_Arrival_¬†is, of course, the aliens, termed heptapods by the film. The heptapods are mysterious seven-limbed aliens that look like crosses between hovering squid and gigantic hands; they lack facial features, humanity never really comes to understand the sounds they make, and their language consists of circular glyphs of ink projected by the heptapods onto the transparent glasslike walls that separate the heptapods in their ship from the human-safe \"guest chamber.\" They are, in short, a far cry from the stereotypical greys or little green men of typical science fiction stereotype; the heptapods are well and truly alien, in every sense of the word.\n\n![[images/Pasted image 20230127134650.png]]\n\n- Perhaps unsurprisingly, the heptapods themselves are the central¬†_novum_¬†of¬†_Arrival_; every other science fiction element in the film (their ships, their language, and so on) flows from them. When we read¬†_Arrival_¬†as a text, therefore, it makes sense that we must look at the design of the heptapods and their related¬†_nova_¬†in order to begin our reading of what ideas the film is trying to introduce as well as what it is trying to say about these ideas.\n\nLet's do a little close reading. In the comments section, respond to any of the following questions:\n1.  If we are to look at the heptapods as a¬†**sign,**¬†what do you think the¬†**signified**¬†is? What kind of abstract ideas and themes do you think their design is meant to communicate?\n2.  What¬†**signifiers**¬†do you think¬†_Arrival_¬†uses to communicate its ideas and themes? What aspects of the design of the heptapods, as well as their ships and language, do you believe are used to communicate the ideas you believe they stand for?\n3.  What can you say about¬†**Louise Banks**? How do her profession, actions, and overall plot and character arc serve to make a statement about the ideas you believe are signified by the film? Why, of all possible protagonists, is she our hero?\n4.  Discuss the heptapods' language as its own¬†_novum_¬†(a¬†_novum_¬†within a¬†_novum_!) in the context of semiotics and our discussion in the previous page of language, intelligence, cognition, and consciousness.\n\n#### Wonder, Critique, and Possibility\n- Science fiction, at its heart, is a genre rooted in ==possibility.== \n\t- That can be hopeful or it can be terrifying--as stated, science fiction is as much about wonder as it is about critique--but ultimately the philosophy that drives it forward is the ==belief that norms are changeable.== \n\t- It is possible to imagine a different universe with its own logic, and it is possible for the logic of a universe to change. Even when history is driven by patterns and cycles, human logic and will and agency have the power to change things, for better or for worse. \n\t- As Suvin writes, \"Significant modern SF‚Ä¶ discusses primarily¬†**the political, psychological, anthropological use and effect of sciences**, and philosophy of science, and¬†**the becoming or failure of new realities as a result of it**.‚Äù\n- What science fiction seeks, Suvin says, is¬†**‚Äúa hope of finding[,] in the unknown[,] the ideal environment, tribe, state, intelligence or other aspect of the Supreme Good (or to a fear of and revulsion from its contrary**.\" It is driven by the belief that ==in confronting the alien, we recognize something--or, conversely, that we can best confront what we know through delving into the unknown. ==\n\t- Frequently that has meant disaster--surely the 2020's do feel like the right time to take up all sorts of dark literature, be it disaster-driven or dystopian or even apocalyptic. But¬†_apocalypse_¬†also means¬†_==revelation_, the unveiling of a new truth, one that forever changes the old order of things.== (If anyone says the phrase \"new normal\" to me, I will scream, but you get the idea.) \n\t- And one of the most radical things we can do in a time of crisis is hold onto the hope that there is something new at the end of all this, that hope persists even when we do not see or know it. As Louise Banks reminds us, ==even when we see ruin before us, we can embrace life and try to do what we can until the next thing is revealed.==\n- [N.K. Jemisin's 2018 Hugo Awards acceptance speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lFybhRxoVM)\n\t- Jemisin reminds us that even in times of hardship, science fiction and fantasy can give us hope: not just the feel-good belief that things can be better, but ==the rigorous work of imagining a different world, and the hard-edged joy of asserting that it can be real.== \n\t- \"It's been a hard year,\" Jemisin says, and that was true in 2018 and it's certainly true now. We hope that your exploration of science fiction, and the work you will put into living this year and beyond, can take something from what she has to share.\n\t- The stars are closer, true believers, and the apocalypse is upon us. Let's ride.\n\n#### Creature Spotlight: Here There Be Dragons\nThis is a part of the course that I'm calling¬†**Creature Spotlights.**¬†We know our time is limited this quarter, and we didn't want to overwhelm you with too many texts, but we also wanted the opportunity to discuss some very cool creatures from science fiction that didn't quite make the cut as full readings. Creature Spotlights are our way of remedying that--a series of quick discussions (**strictly optional--**if you're low on time, feel free to ignore Creature Spotlights entirely) about iconic or popular science fiction creatures that we can discuss without taking too much time away from the course reading list. And we're starting here because while this is specifically a science fiction course rather than a broader class on speculative fiction, we would be remiss if we didn't talk about one of the most iconic creatures in popular culture and mythology: the dragon.\n\n- The dragon's symbolic power as an exercise in applying semiotics to a fictional creature \n\t- See, the interesting thing about dragons is that while we all more or less know what a dragon is, the image of the dragon has never been entirely constant, instead shifting as one examines different eras and cultures throughout history.\n\t- ¬†[**\"The Evolution of Dragons in Western Literature: A History\"**](https://www.tor.com/2019/10/23/the-evolution-of-dragons-in-western-literature-a-history/)\n\t\t- Early in her article, she lays the foundation for her exploration of the various forms of the dragon with these paragraphs: ![[images/Pasted image 20230127135509.png]]\n\t\t- Shiau's article is a great survey of the various dragon archetypes that have proliferated throughout Western culture and history: she does a good job exploring what the dragon in all its many forms has meant to us. Where she leaves room to speculate is the¬†_why_¬†of it: why¬†_this_¬†is the image (or set of images) that has stuck with us and become so iconic and powerful in all our minds.\n\t- If you're interested in learning more about dragons, or want to watch a really cool text that treats a fictional creature as if it were real (what am I talking about, of course dragons are real), you can check out¬†[**The Last Dragon**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18X0otcm0gtq1Fu2vKD5e9IZ6VSt_hab3/view?usp=share_link), one of our suggested readings for the course. It's a 2004 docufiction film directed by Justin Hardy that examines how dragons might have evolved throughout history if they'd been real. It's totally optional, but it might be a cool source of inspiration for ways to approach the creative project for this class (and it's very much in the spirit of what this class is all about).\n- But for now, it's¬†**discussion**¬†**prompt time.**\n\t- Choose¬†**one of the \"major dragons\"**¬†which Shiau identifies (or some other pop culture dragon that you'd like to talk about). Do some background research on them and¬†**expand her brief description of the dragon**¬†you picked, paying attention to¬†**how they uphold or subvert your expectations**¬†of what a dragon is or should be.\n\t- Speculate: what is it about the traits we commonly associate with dragons (e.g. large size, reptilian appearance, supernatural breath weapon, and so on) that we find so compelling?¬†**What is it about dragons that makes them such an enduring symbol?**\n\t- Dragons can be good models for understanding the basic concepts of evolutionary biology. Why do you think so? Biologically speaking, what make/s dragons a fun exercise in speculative biology (i.e. studying the biology of fictional creatures)?\n\n### Synchronous Lecture Notes\n#### The Literature of Cognitive Estrangement\n- \"SF takes off from **a fictional ('literary') hypothesis** and **develops it with extrapolating and totalizing ('scientific') rigor.**\"\n- \"The effect of such **factual reporting of fictions** is one of **confronting a set normative system**...with a point of view or glance implying **a new set of norms**.\"\n- \"A representation which estranges is one which **allows us to recognize its subject**, but at the same time **makes it seem unfamiliar.**\" (Brecht)\n\n#### The *Novum*\n- Latin: \"new\" or \"new thing\" (in Suvin's essay, \"a strange newness\")\n- A _novum_ is a **point of difference** between the science fiction text and the empirical environment/the real world.\n- \"An SF text may be based on one _novum_...

You create an identity through the situations you've become part of\n\t\t\t\t1. Gone through shit? That's a situation, not an identity. What you make of that is your identity\n\t\t\t3. At the end of the day, you'll have to make sense of what you expereince, because that'll become part of your identity\n\t2. **Stress Engagement**\n\t\t1.

Why was that so hard?\"_\n- With these words, Sinclair identifies the ==tensions of the modernist==, which have to do with the clash of the self with forces that impact on it.\n- And what are these forces? Why, you name them! \n\t- We have social expectations, nature, what people say about us, what people say we should do, events like political issues, national elections, and war.\n- And, on top of all that, the self clashes with the self too! The ==unconscious==, the ==psyche==, is there. \n- So, the modern condition is characterized by the struggle of ==Being or 'be-ing' ==as a process against all these external and internal forces. \n\t- In other words, whereas the philosdpher, Rene Descarte, famously uttered the words,¬†_I think therefore I am_, the modern condition might as well say,¬†_I am? What is that?_¬†All these forces that we struggle against have made it very difficult to figure out who we are and¬†_live the life that is inside us_.\n\t- As you go through this module--no, through the whole class--bear in mind this struggle of¬†_be-ing_. How do I live the life that is inside of me, trying to get out? OR, what's my thing? And how will I know what it is?\n\n\u003e Can you identify some forces that impact make it hard for a person to discover a sense of self? Write no more than 150 words.\n\nFor me, some forces that have been definitely getting in the way of *being* are societal expectations and self-imposed pressure ‚Äî both of which go hand in hand. Nowadays, in a hyper-online world, we're exposed to the highlights of everyone' lives; unfortunately, this exacerbates my unhealthy tendency to compare myself to others. It leads me to working myself to the bone in order to \"catch up\", which isn't helpful at all. It gives me no time to discern whether or not a certain goal is good for me at all.\n\n#### More about modernism\n- _Modernism_¬†is not about a certain time period. Rather, it's about ==a way of perceiving, a way of be-ing, a sensibility, a way of thinking about the self==, compared to other ways of perceiving and be-ing.\n- Here are two poems that express different ways of perceiving the self, different ways of be-ing. On one hand, we have Romanticist John Keats and on the other hand, we have the Bard, William Shakespeare. Shakespeare lived two centuries before Keats; yet, his poem expresses a modernist sensibility.\n\n##### Keats' poem to the stars\n![[images/Pasted image 20230201114035.png]]\n- In this poem, the persona (and the voice of the poem can be the poet or can be someone else) speaks of admiring the ==steadfastness== of a star... the forever that stars seem to symbolize. \n- The quality of steadfastness, which the persona admires, is ==found in nature, outside the self.== The self, then, can, like nature, have this quality. \n- As we read the poem, we also get the feeling that ==natural processes are to be admired and human beings, to reach the fullness of ourselves, should aspire to have the perfection of nature.== Reading Keats and you almost have the feeling that the human and nature should be one.\n\n##### Shakespeare's Macebeth: Deathbed speech\n![[images/Pasted image 20230201114149.png]]\n- After everything he had achieved, Macbeth knows that he is about to die. If you've read the play, Macbeth did everything he could to secure power for himself and for his descendants but ==death is inevitable== and in these lines, he realizes that he has been defeated. \n- In these lines, Shakespeare uses a favorite comparison, that is, the ==similarity between an individual human life and a character (a player) in a stage play==, who enters and exits the stage on cue.\n\n##### Comparison\n- The contrast between Keats's poem and Shakespeare's illustrates some very important characteristics of the modernist sensibility. \n- For one thing, Keats, because of is allusions to nature, give us the feeling of the ==immortality of the self.== Even in death, we are like nature so we continue somehow, along with stars, grass, rocks, fields, the sea. \n- But with Shakespeare, Macbeth realizes that upon his death, he is, well, dead. His life is snuffed out like a candle, like an actor who has to leave the stage. With the modernist sensibility, ==life is rendered woefully inadequate== and it's only, in Macbeth's words, 'an idiot' who will refuse to accept that.¬†\n- But, what we learn from modernism, though, is ==despite knowing that life is finite, the process of¬†_truly_¬†be-ing itself seems to be what life is all about.==\n\n#### The power of the psyche\n- Two important figures to modernism are the great psychoanalysts, Sigmund Freud and Carl Gustav Jung. \n- When Freud wrote about the unconscious and Jung, his student, continued his work, it became ==impossible to think of the human being as 'whole'.== \n- If you notice, in Keats's poem, the notion of steadfastness is accepted as a trait that people can aspire for. The conflict comes out of the ==persona wanting that trait but maybe not quite having it yet. ==\n- With Shakespeare, though, the conflict is in the very nature of selfhood. If tomorrow will come and we all die, then what for is ==carving a self==? \n- With Keats, what is at stake are ==the qualities that the self can have.== With Shakespeare, what is at stake is ==the existence of the self.== In other words, with Shakespeare, ==the self is fractured, having a nature that is at war with itself. ==\n- Jung has pointed out that ==we are 'enigmas' to ourselves.== Because we don't know ourselves, we are in a state of conflict with ourselves.\n- Jung has also pointed out that ==self-knowledge is usually just based on what we know of ourselves socially.== \n\t- Take myself as an example. Socially, I am female, married, middle-aged, teacher, Filipino, middle-class, educated, administrator, martial artist, crocheter, cat mom, cyclist, homemaker. All these social identifiers of who I am affect my decisions and my sense of self. \n\t- But as Jung would say, these are all just on the surface. ==It's what is happening in the psyche that matters.== Hence, I sometimes have strange and vivid dreams that have nothing to do with who I am socially. And this is why ==to the modernist sensibility, we all have cracks and fissures where 'true being',== as Jung would say, come out.¬†\n- Jung has also argued that ==the problem with society is it only cares for what is external.== The psyche itself is ignored and this leads to many problems, such as mental health and behavioral issues. He has argued that ignoring the psyche will lead us all to very detrimental effects. \n- To Jung, we have long forgotten to pay careful attention to the individual; ==sacrificing the individual for the collective.== Hence, modern society ignores the authentic responses of the individual, in favor of collective conditions. \n\t- This is why history is full of movements of collective acts (like war) but the individual may feel alienated from these collective acts. There is no such thing as a whole individual, just as there is no such thing as a whole society or culture.\n- To read: **Jung's \"The undiscovered self\".**\n\n#### What is reality anyway?\n- What we also learn from the work of psychoanalysts is that reality does not necessarily exist as an objective truth. Rather, ==the world to us is defined for us by how we see it.== And how we see the world and how we are in the world are also largely ==determined by the unconscious==, by the psyche that we know so little about.¬†\n- The fact that it's difficult to put a finger on objective reality comes out in our ==languaging.== Many of the things we say, can, after all, be questioned grammatically. For example:¬†_the sky is blue,¬†isn't it_?¬†¬†_I am a girl,¬†aren't I_?¬†It can be very difficult for us to understand each other because ==we perceive reality in different ways.==\n\n#### Reading \"Demian\"\nAs you read it, ask yourself how the lives of Demian and Emile Sinclair seem to give expression to Jung's ideas, particularly:\n-  how reality is created by our own perceptions as opposed to the perceptions of others\n-   why the journey to the self can be terrifying\n-   how collective action can actually both enrich and obliterate the self\n\nQuestion: Do you think Demian and Sinclair had found true self-knowledge? Have you?\n\n## Psychology of Personal Growth\n#psychology #personaldevelopment \n### The Power of Habit\n1. **Habits are simple cue-routine-reward loops that save effort.**\n\t1. MIT experiment: mice seeking chocolate in maze\n\t\t1. When they memorized the path, brain activity lessened\n\t2. Chunking: process of turning a sequence of actions into an automatic routine\n\t3. Habit loop\n\t\t1. Cue\n\t\t2. Routine\n\t\t3. Reward\n\t4. ==Habits are incredibly resilient.== Learning and maintaining habits lies in the *basal ganglia*, a small neurological structure embedded deep in the brain. Even if the rest of the brain is damaged, this can still function normally.\n\t\t1. Same can apply to bad habits; you may always be at the risk of relapsing\n2. **Habits stick because they create craving.**\n\t1. Kicking a bad habit is hard because you develop a *craving* for the reward at the end of the habit loop.\n\t2. *Anticipation* is the neurological basis of craving, which explains why habits are so powerful.\n\t3. Craving works for good habits as well, E.G. exercise.\n\t4. ==Craving is what solidifies the habit==; cues and rewards alone are not enough.\n\t5. Companies try to create craving for their consumers too.\n\t\t1. Example application: Claude Hopkins, the man who popularized Pespodent toothpaste by creating the cool, minty feeling you get after brushing your teeth. \n3. **To create a habit, substitute a routine for another and believe in the change.**\n\t1. Golden rule for quitting any habit: *don't try to resist the craving, redirect it.*\n\t\t1. Keep the same cues and rewards, but change the routine that occurs as a result of the craving.\n\t2. While habit-replacement is effective, it can be rendered null ==whenever stress occurs.== Old habits die hard, no matter how much time you take trying to kill them.\n\t3. Those who resist relapse and remain sober often rely on belief.\n\t\t1. Importance of spirituality and God in AA philosophy\n\t\t2. It's not necessarily the religious component itself that helps people stay sober. ==Believing in God also helps the participants believe in the possibility of change for themselves, which makes them stronger in the face of stressful life events.==\n4. **Change can be achieved by focusing on keystone habits and achieving small wins.**\n\t1. Paul O'Neill as CEO of Alcoa\n\t\t1. Workplace safety\n\t\t2. Habits exists in organizations, and changing an organization's direction is a matter of changing its habits.\n\t2. Not all habits are created equal. \n\t3. **Keystone habits:** more important than other habits, because adhering to these create positive effects that spillover to other areas.\n\t\t1. Example keystone habit for individuals: keeping a meticulous food journal\n\t\t2. These habits work by providing ==small wins== -- that is, early successes are fairly easy to attain. \n\t\t3. Developing a keystone habit helps you believe that improvement is possible in other spheres of life, too, which can trigger a cascade of positive change.\n5. **Willpower is the most important keystone habit.**\n\t1. Marshmallow experiment\n\t\t1. The ones who delayed gratification often ended up becoming more successful in life\n\t2. Willpower is actually like a muscle: it can tire.\n\t\t1. If you exhaust it by concentrating on a demanding task, you'll have no willpower left after doing it.\n\t\t2. You can strengthen your willpower by engaging in habits that demand resolution (e.g. adhering to a strict diet). Like a willpower workout\n\t3. Other factors can impact willpower as well, such as people you interact with\n\t\t1. Starbucks LATTE method\n\t4. A lack of autonomy also adversely affects willpower.\n\t\t1. If people do something because they are ordered to rathen than by choice, their willpower muscle tires much quicker.\n6. **Organizational habits can be dangerous, but a crisis can change them.**\n\t1. E.G. King's Cross 1987 fire\n\t2. Crises offer a unique chance to reform organizational habits by providing a sense of emergency.\n\t3. Good leaders often actively prolong a sense of emergency or even exacerbate it.\n\t\t1. This is because it allows for various solutions to arise.\n7. **Companies take advantage of habits in their marketing.**\n\t1. DYK: filling up your cart with healthy items first makes you more likely to buy unhealthy items later\n\t2. When trying to sell anything new, companies will try their best to make it familiar.\n8. **Movements are born from strong ties, peer pressure, and new habits.**\n\t1. E.G. Rosa Parks and the civil rights movement\n\t2. She had Strong ties: concept from sociology; first-hand relationships with people across different sectors of community\n\t3. Weak ties: acquaintances rather than friends\n\t4. Weak ties, combined with strong ties, empower peer pressure.\n9. **We bear the responsibility for changing our habits.**\n\t1. Once we become aware of a harmful habit, it becomes our responsibility to address and change it.\n\n### Good Writing\n#writing\n1. Rubrics\n\t1. Grammar\n\t2. Style and Reference\n\t3.

Another simple change I can do is to replace my usual sweets with healthier alternatives (e.g. switching out ice cream for greek yoghurt).","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T15:56:57.0001364Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2023-02-02":{"title":"2023-02-02","content":"## Discerning Life Questions\n#religion #spirituality #philosophy \n- **What does God have to do with discernment?** If we don't answer this question, we will end up staying with the many misconceptions we have about God, many of which we've had since we were kids.\n- **[The Flying Spaghetti Monster and Why the Atheists are Right (Is God a being?)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_hzyCFHh1o)**\n\t- Misconception: **God is a divine being.**\n\t- Satirical religion: Pastifarians\n\t\t- Started to protest the teaching of intelligent design\n\t\t- Point here: there are a lot of misconceptions from both religious and non-religious people about God.

In**¬†**approx. 3-5 sentences, share about how the issue was dealt with in Greek education**¬†(Identifying the specific segment in Greek Education),¬†**as well as what you think might have affected this.**¬†Cite excerpts from the readings to qualify your statements (cited phrases not included in the 3-5 sentences).\n\nOne problem present in Greek Education (particularly the Late Athenian period) that still challenges us today is the emphasis of bookish and schoolroom tactics \"...in which rote learning or memorization was superseding the activities of the earlier period.\" An example of this in our present times is the study of history; I can't help but think about how most of my history classes relied on memorization methods. Solutions to this problem were offered by one of the most prominent philosophers at the time: Socrates. One is informal education; \"He believed in gaining knowledge through direct contct with people and by personal observation and experience. He felt that in such ways knowledge revealed itself through the soul.\"; the other is the Socratic method, which aimed to make students' aware of (and thus act on) their own ignorance. However, despite these methods being influential today, they weren't able to shape educational practices in Ancient Greece due to the selfish individualism of the populace; \"The people as a whole, though superficially acquainteed with their teachings, were little influenced by them; while most of the nelightened and educated class were already throughly corrupted... The lack of ethical standards developed by this individualistic education ultimately brought the Athenians to ruin.\"\n\n\n- problems\n\t- education's emphasis on memory (e.g. drills, lectures)\n\t\t- \"Education tended to emphasize bookish and schoolroom tactics, in which rote learning or memorization was superseding the activities of the earlier period.\"\n\t- I believe this can still be present in our schools today...I can't help but think about how much of my historical education consisted of memorization\n- solution\n\t- the intellectual training that developed during the late Athenian period e.g. Socratic method....ensures that the student is critically thinking\n\t- revival of activity method\n\n### Summary of Module 1\n- **CONTEXT SHAPES PURPOSE**\n\t- One of the initial patterns that we have began to explore in module 1 was how the context of an era shaped the purpose of education - ex. how China's geography led it its aim of \"self-preservation\" - or how the beliefs of the various eras in ancient greek society led to different perspectives about the aim of education. \n\t- As you reflect on your own teaching philosophy, think about today's context? ==How does your own personal vision of what education is for grounded in the needs of today's context?==\n- **PURPOSE SHAPES PRACTICE**\n\t- Another pattern we began to see was how the aim of education affected the types and methods of education. If you look at institutions today, I think we can continue to say the same thing - for example, schools like Ateneo who continues to put to forefront being a person for others encourage reflection about society and one's role in our courses.","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T15:56:57.0001364Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2023-02-07":{"title":"2023-02-07","content":"## Biology of Science Fiction\n#BIO21i #biology #sciencefiction\n### Module 2: Biodiversity in Science Fiction\n#### Evolution Explains Biodiversity Anywhere\n- One of the most fascinating things about science fiction that showcases biological tropes is ==the diversity of non-Earth species==, many of which are intelligent humanoids that are able to communicate with humans.\n- But not all life in sci-fi worlds is willing or have the capacity to communicate and cooperate. Out there are aliens so bizarre in morphology and psychology that normal means of communication are difficult at best and deadly at worst.\n\nThere are two primary questions to answer in exploring the biodiversity of sci-fi worlds:\n1. Where did all this biodiversity come from?\n2. What role does evolution play in this biodiversity?\n\nTo be able to understand these, we turn to the only real-life example that we know for now: Earth. Watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJZNOw3IA4) for a discussion on how evolution explains biodiversity.\n\n- **[[Permanent Notes/Speciation]]** is an evolutionary process that gives rise to new species from pre-existing ones.\n  - What this implies in science fiction is that all of the sci-fi aliens that we know had ancestors, unless the species itself is the progenitor of all life.\n  - But speciation is a long process (on Earth, it normally takes at least a million years) and requires **reproductive isolation** or the inability of two formerly intermingling and reproducing populations to keep on mating. \n  - Usually, that's due to a geographical barrier that physically separates them, which is the mode of speciation called **allopatric** (allo = different, patric = land). In many of these shared universes, allopatric speciation may explain why so many humanoid species look alike; they probably shared ancestors and just evolved separately because they were separated by space!   \n- Also important in understanding speciation is the concept of the **[[Permanent Notes/Niche]]**, which ecologically speaking is ==the set of all possible environmental conditions that will allow a population to sustain itself.==\n  - According to the **[[Permanent Notes/Competitive Exclusion Principle]]**, ==no two species can occupy the same niche at the same time indefinitely.== Two species can compete for the same resource for only so long; the outcompeted will have to diverge from the niche and thus potentially become a new species, or else go extinct. \n  - A lot of sci-fi worlds with vicious apex predators, especially intelligent ones, probably won their dominance in this way. And then there are those that expand their genetic reach in even more fearsome ways: through forceful parasitism and assimilation.\n\n**Points for Discussion**\n1. Can the niche of a sci-fi species be considered a novum of its own? If yes, how so?\n2. Look for examples of alien species in a shared sci-fi universe that are (or may be) results of allopatric speciation.\n\n#### The Life Out There: Attempts at Classification\n- In biology, we try to make sense of species and their evolutionary relationships through **classification**, which is ==placing them in distinct groups called taxa (singular: taxon)== like specific kingdoms (e.g. Plantae, Animalia), phyla (e.g. Chordata, Arthropoda, Cnidaria), classes (e.g. Mammalia, Amphibia, Insecta), etc. that share very similar characteristics.\n  - This, along with naming species, is a practice in the science of **taxonomy**. \n- Like what Sir. Ron says in his article \"Mutations and Metamorphoses: Body Horror is Biological Horror\" (Journal of Popular Film and Television 40:160-168, 2102) about hybrids in body horror cinema, ==the other-ness of aliens may perhaps be treated as a _taxonomic_ cognitive estrangement, because they defy Earth-based categorizations even if they seem similar to our life-forms.==\n- When trying to make sense of sci-fi aliens, it is ==safe to assume that life on these other planets have the same genetic code and follow the same genetic mechanisms and evolutionary tendencies as life on Earth==, unless the text tells us otherwise.\n  - So we can expect very similar forms to Earth's organisms, with liberal modifications, to populate fictional worlds. \n  - On Earth, the most common animals are arthropods (those like insects, spiders, and crustaceans that have jointed appendages and a hard chitinous exoskeleton), molluscs (soft-bodied often shelled animals like snails, bivalves, and squids), and chordates (the large group that includes vertebrates like ourselves). Can we expect to see the same trends in science fiction?\n\n##### Exercise\nAs a an exercise in exploring the biodiversity in sci-fi, go to the [Alien Species Wiki](https://aliens.fandom.com/wiki/Alien_Species_Wiki) and select one (1) alien species (try one that isn't too popular or obvious!) and use the following dichotomous key to try to classify it according to Earth definitions (which as of now are the only ones we have to go by!). We've said that the cognitive estrangement in these alien life-forms may lie in their blurring of our taxonomic categories, but that doesn't mean that we can't try to make sense of them!\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23095578/217153022-f01aaf3e-d173-4f2a-963d-bb28203746a9.png)\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23095578/217153095-f5154d6b-b449-4eb6-9096-43379f02ca40.png)\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23095578/217153118-20ac56f8-be88-4459-aeb3-ddb5d623dfc5.png)\n\n#### Phenotypes and Archetypes\n- One important part of reading science fiction creatures is looking at ==how their design affects their semiotic content==--the ways in which how they look and function as organisms contribute to the meaning/s they communicate as part of text.\n- While the creatures and worlds of science fiction are imaginary, this is not to say they come _purely_ from the imagination. All science fiction is produced by at least one author rooted in what we know as the real world (what Suvin calls **\"the set normative system\"**), and so ==every work of science fiction is necessarily informed by and responding to the real world==, at least as perceived by the author.\n\t  - This is ideally true on a scientific level--if we believe good science fiction is at least somewhat informed by the principles of good science--but it is also true on a literary level. \n\t  - What this means is that we, as both readers and authors of science fiction, come into it with ==our own set of biases that shape our reading==, and these are perspectives we can both employ and interrogate when it comes to examining the fantastic _nova_ that inhabit our stories. \n\n##### Hyperlanes\n  - In the Kickstarter-backed _Hyperlanes_, a sci-fi campaign setting that uses D\u0026D 5th edition rules, race (here called species) selection in the process of character generation provides more flexibility, allowing a player to create new species using template traits for common biological forms. Read Chapter 1: Species of the player's guide.\n  - For this discussion and the special quiz, you need to read the section on Physiology (starting on page 6), but we highly encourage you to read the entire chapter.\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23095578/217154024-52f14d64-125b-4a96-aba2-bf65a204dc92.png)\n\nHere are the Physiologies that the book offers as options, with Ron's notes on the biological bases for their suggested traits:\n- **Amphibian:** I wouldn't say that amphibians are naturally more dexterous than us or our fellow mammals, but their tongues are definitely quick at capturing prey! Take note that not all amphibians can leap like frogs do, because salamanders are also amphibians, and so are some limbless, snake-like animals called caecilians. Quite a number of amphibians do have poisonous skin, so that's a good call, but usually you'd have to ingest the animal or get its toxins in your blood to be affected (and that's why they're poisonous and not venomous). But the more accurate traits here are Prefers the Damp and Water Adapted. Being direct descendants of fish and spending their larval stages in the water, amphibians are largely semi-aquatic, and they cannot survive in dry environments because they need to breathe through their skin.\n- **Arthropoid:** In kingdom Animalia, the term \"arthropoid\" would actually refer to organisms that belong to phylum Arthropoda, which is distinct from other groups of animals due to their exoskeleton made of chitin or calcium carbonate, which they typically shed, and their jointed appendages (including legs and wings). So the Body Armor and Extra Limbs traits have those covered. It's good that they didn't include flight as a trait because insect wings are too flimsy to allow a human-sized individual to truly fly.\n- **Arachnoid:** Biologically speaking, arachnids are actually also arthropods, but I suppose having the ability to produce your own webbing gives you the right to your own template. The Spinnerets trait covers that and is amusingly accurate because that's really what a spider's silk-spinning appendages are called. Take note, however, that scientifically, the term arachnid refers not only to spiders but also to scorpions, ticks, mites, and harvestmen (daddy longlegs).\n- **Aquatic:** It's a catch-all template that could easily mean you're fish-like as much as it can mean that you're a giant jellyfish. The Water Mastery trait is obvious, but the 360 Vision and Pilot's Mind traits are inspired additions because being surrounded by water and receiving stimuli from all around you at the same time does give you a different sort of perspective (I could imagine). This is especially true of radially symmetrical organisms like jellyfish that have sensory cells arranged all around their bell (that round part that looks like a head but isn't), but in a certain amusing way, the same can also be said of fish because of their lateral line system and the freaky fact that they have taste buds on their skin.\n- **Avian:** The writers aren't fans of the aarakocra, are they? Instead of giving this template true flight, they limit the wings' capabilities to gliding. I wouldn't use size as an excuse, as there have historically been pretty big natural fliers in Earth's history, but it would make sense for avian characters to have lighter, hollow bones, so I would probably consider decreasing Constitution a bit. Birds, especially the predatory ones, do usually have keener eyesight and larger optic lobes than most other animals, so Superior Vision and Pilot's Mind are a nice touch.\n- **Cephalapoid:** Did anyone say Cthulhu? The amazing group of animals called cephalopods, which is a type of mollusk, deserves so much more than the typical aquatic traits and the Extra Limbs feature. I'd personally throw in a Constitution increase given their toughness, something that enhances their Perception because of their sensory acuity, and some special camouflaging ability due to their ability to control their pigmentation. Now THAT would make an awesome character race.\n- **Fungoid:** Dispersed Physiology? Iron Constitution? Mycotoxins? Saprophyte? These authors had a ball with designing this template, the most unique of all of them (maybe they were on shrooms). Each of these traits is spot-on in portraying the novelty of the lowly fungus and makes for a character design unlike any other. if I were to nitpick, I'd swap the touch-dependent Mycotoxins ability with one that allows the character to disperse poisonous spores, but that's probably asking for too much. And also, fungi don't have brains. Or a head. But we're talking about humanoid fungi anyway.\n- **Gastropoid:** Another mollusk, gastropods are a group of animals known mostly for the shells that they have on their backs, but do note that there are shell-less snails (generally called slugs). The Slime Trail is a nice (if a bit gross) touch, though I'd have added some form of communication with fellow gastropoids in that ability. Also, the Armored Body trait is cool and all, but let's all remember that you'd have to be lugging that large, cumbersome thing around with you. One question: can they hide inside their shells?\n- **Mammalian:** Given how highly social an animal a typical mammal is, the Group Behavior feature makes sense. The four subtemplates give some variation to what would have been an otherwise uninteresting template (there's only so much benefit you can gain from fur and mammary glands) and touch on peculiarities of some major mammalian lifestyles.\n- **Plantoid:** Obviously, Photosynthesis is the best and most scientifically accurate feature of this template. I would have taken that trait further to waive the character's need to eat food as long as it gets regular sunlight exposure. And what about thorns?\n- **Reptilian:** The Natural Weaponry, Scaly Armor, and Darkvision traits are expected. Venom would have been a nice touch, but of course not all reptiles have venomous bites.\n\n(Sir AJ's Note : The way games address race--or, if you prefer, species or ancestry or physiology--is a highly animated area of discussion in gaming circles, particularly in systems like Hyperlanes and D\u0026D where there are multiple sapient species. If we distinguish these species mechanically, how much of that is rightful respect for biological diversity, and ==how much of that is reproducing the colonial mindset that some races are inherently better than others at certain things?== Consider how humans are always portrayed as a jack-of-all-trades species in fiction, whereas nonhuman species tend to be pigeonholed into particular cultures or stereotypes--goblins are almost always savage enemies, elves are almost always ethereal and graceful and wise, and so on--and then think about how that lines up with real-world stereotypes about different human ethnicities.)\n\n##### Arrival's Heptapods\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23095578/217154518-74241d2f-f8cd-4263-a46c-0fabc44636c6.png)\n- Broadly speaking, the heptapod's design is reminiscent of three things: a squid or octopus, a seven-fingered hand, and at the top, the barest suggestion of a human head and torso. \n  - Cephalopods like squid and octopi are among the most alien-looking creatures we have on Earth, largely because their bodies are so dissimilar to ours: they have tentacles instead of jointed limbs, the tentacles are all in one place, and it's more difficult to ascribe orientation (e.g. forward, backward, up, down) than it is for ours. \n  - The heptapods take these traits and echo them, even moving in a squidlike manner and communicating through disgorging squid-like ink. Much about the design of the heptapods is meant to ==intentionally invoke our conceptions of squid and octopi==, which then draws on all our associations of them as ==strange, alien creatures. ==\n- ==This design philosophy is echoed in the heptapod script:== just as the heptapods have \"no forward or backward movement,\" so too does their language not read in a linear way, and this is further echoed by their perception of time. \n  - The [[Permanent Notes/Sapir-Whorf hypothesis]] quoted in the film--the real-world theory that ==the structure of our language affects the way we see the world==--is born out in the way the creatures' language, perceptions, and appearance all reflect and reinforce each other: radial, nonlinear, otherworldly.\n- But the heptapods are more than just calligrapher squid--==they also incorporate some human elements, but in a highly _defamiliarized_ manner. ==\n\t- The top of the heptapod looks like a human head and torso, but stripped of all identifying features. \n\t- The form of the squid, which already sort of resembles a tentacled hand, has the hand-like aspect of its design heightened: the limbs of the heptapod look more like spider legs or human fingers, and each of them ends in its own set of starfish-like fingers or tendrils. \n\t- The hand is traditionally seen as an image of familiarity and affinity: humanlike hands are things we can shake, things that hold things the way we do, things we associate with caresses and intimacy and humanity. \n\t  - But the heptapods subvert that expectation by estranging the image of the hand: the hand becomes the entire body (which then has its own, smaller hands, which totally isn't creepy at all), the number of fingers becomes seven (a number we are not used to seeing in anatomy), and the fingers at once resemble tentacles and spider limbs. \n\t  - This design exemplifies ==the blend of cognition, the understanding of the familiar, and estrangement, the divergence from expectations of normality==, that is at the heart of science fiction. The heptapods are bizarre and relatable, known and unknown to us.\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23095578/217154819-b1972edb-2b0e-478c-a5d6-f6e0616faa4e.png)\n\n- Often, we humans judge other creatures according to their proximity to the human norm: ==we find things that \"look more human\" more appealing, while othering and fearing things that are less so. ==\n  - This shapes, for example, our perceptions of the human-looking aliens of the Star Trek universe vis-a-vis the way we see the alien bugs from properties like Alien, StarCraft, Warhammer 40K, Ender's Game, and George R. R. Martin's \"Sandkings\" (which, spoiler, is one of our readings for this module!). \n  - On one level, this is natural, but on another level, it can be problematic if not outright dangerous: ==the very natural human affinity for things like us is also one of the ingredients that can fuel prejudice, racism, the violent subjugation of the other== that we see in both colonialism and fascism, you name it.\n- Indeed, ==the very human-centric-ness of science fiction==--again, natural, as most science fiction that humans read is also written by humans (citation needed)--==is often used to center the dominant point of view== (often cis, straight, white, and male), ==while othering aliens and relegating \"non-normative\" characteristics== (e.g. queer-coded traits and androgyny, or those associated with indigenous people or people of color) ==to the realm of the exotic and different==, the alien zoo or safari which our heroes explore and subject to their gaze.\n  - This is not to say that all evil bug aliens are actually the good guys, or that we should stop writing human protagonists and alien antagonists entirely and that all works that operate this way are Bad and Wrong. \n  - This is merely to say that ==we need to be conscious of our biases when we explore science fiction==--who it centers, who it marginalizes, who and what it portrays as complex and sympathetic versus flat and stereotypical, what characteristics from real-life cultures and communities it invokes and in what contexts--==in much the same way as we should be conscious of them in real life. ==\n  - A lot of good science fiction, especially these days, is likewise conscious of these biases, and may use and explore them as part of its project, and this is an exciting step in terms of seeing where the genre can go.\n\n#### \"Sandkings\" - Alien Ant Farm\n- \"Sandkings\" by George R. R. Martin is a story about pets and God. Or, to be more accurate (and less potentially heretical), pets and ==\"God,\" as in the general concept of a higher being (and the way we perceive and construct it, and the conditions under which we do so)== rather than any particular belief about one. \n- It's a story about ==gazing and being gazed upon==, and whether the one can truly happen without the other. \n- It's a story about a man named Simon Kress, an altogether terrible person who is utterly familiar to anyone who has ever fantasized about burning ants with a magnifying glass or playing The Sims just to watch virtual people suffer. And, as with so many works in our syllabus, it's ==a story about power, and what power does to those who wield it and those who do not.==\n- But mostly it's about bugs.\n\n##### Sandking Lane Build\n- The central _novum_ of the story is the titular sandkings, a creature best described as what happens when your ant farm decides to play DotA. Sandkings are social insect-like creatures with telepathic hive-minds centered on their maws, fertile queens that are described as looking like relatively large, slimy, featureless pieces of meat. \n- The maws spawn and control mobiles, the ant-like warriors that comprise the bulk of a sandking colony that eventually metamorphose into second-stage forms and possibly even rare third-stage forms designed by the maw itself. \n- Sandking colonies live in castle-like structures, and neighboring castles go to war with each other (or at least that is how they behave in captivity), and they seem to instinctively make art based on their keepers' appearance (again, in captivity, at least).\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23095578/217155643-9768880d-204d-43f5-b501-dfb4cb38972e.png)\n- The main quartet of sandking colonies around which the story revolves are divided by color, with black, red, white, and orange colonies all displaying different tendencies, battle skills, and aesthetic preferences, although we know these aren't the only colors that exist (Jala Wo has a yellow colony in her set). \n  - We don't know if the maws always come in sets of four, and we don't know if each color is necessarily associated with a certain set of traits. What we do know is that the sandkings behave very differently when abused, something the story highlights in a number of ways.\n- The sandkings are George R. R. Martin's take on a classic science fiction trope: that of the **alien bug**. \n  - From the tyranids of Warhammer 40K to the Brood who menace the X-Men to the Formics from Ender's Game, bug aliens are a common science fiction trope seen in a variety of texts across many media. \n  - Whether they are sapient, feral, or individually animalistic but controlled by impossibly intelligent hive-minds, they very often fall into the \"other\" category: whether deserved or not, whether subverted by the text or played straight, they are the alien to our human, the them to our us.\n- Some traits often shared by bug aliens are the following:\n  - Often not humanoid; even the more humanoid ones often have extra limbs (insect/non-human-like traits emphasized)\n  - Far too large (amps up their creepiness and unfamiliarity; giant bugs are scary)\n  - Collectivist societies, often ruled by hive-minds (this is an estrangement of the way real eusocial insect colonies behave)\n\n##### Sir. Ron's Notes\n- Let's dwell a bit on something that Sir. AJ just mentioned: **[[Permanent Notes/Eusociality]].** Among animals, eusociality is the ultimate expression of altruism: ==individuals in a colony are willing to sacrifice themselves for the benefit of the colony. ==\n  - Think bees, which die when they sting threats to their hive and their queen. As you may have guessed, such selfless living is quite rare in the natural world. Most known eusocial species, of which there are only few, are insects like bees and termites. There are a few in the marine environment like certain species of sponge-dwelling shrimp. \n  - Among mammals, there's only one type of animal known to be eusocial. No, it's not humans. It's the naked mole rat. \n- What do eusocial species have in common? It's important to take note that they live in tightly knit groups, specifically colonies, where a distinct division of labor is dictated upon by genetically predetermined roles. \n  - Because young that are born into the colony do not leave the home, there ends up being an overlapping of generations. Typically, there is only one reproductive female and so is the source of all progeny, making all her offspring virtually identical (especially in cases where there is also one only reproductive male). That's partly why self-sacrifice is ok, specifically from a genetic perspective; ==the loss of one individual isn't too much to bear if there are many other individuals that are genetically identical== (and since we're talking about organisms like insects, when we say \"many,\" we mean many). \n  - All non-reproductive individuals have roles in maintaining the colony, with the largest ones usually being relegated to defensive functions (and that's why most eusocial species are characterized by some weapon, like a bee's sting, an ant's mandibles, a shrimp's claws, and a naked mole rat's...naked ugliness? It's a confusing animal.).\n- It's fascinating how ==true altruism has been used by sci-fi as the basis for many of the most frightening characteristics of malevolent alien bug races, including the \"hive-mind\" social structure== (which, luckily enough for us feeble humans, is also often their greatest weakness, as exemplified by Starship Troopers and Ender's Game). \n  - Speaking of the hive-mind, the members of a eusocial colony are of course not joined telepathically and they don't \"think and act as one,\" but their collective actions are certainly guided and their social structures maintained by pheromones, which are hormones used within a species for a variety of purposes like finding mates, marking territory, tracking food sources, etc. \n  - And killing the queen will weaken the colony and cause a lot of disarray for a while, but it won't kill all the other individuals like some sort of kill switch. In fact, queens that die are usually quickly replaced by the next dominant female.\n- Having said all of that, the sandkings have many other peculiarities that don't have an analogue in the real biological world, which I think begs the question: _**Do they behave like this in the wild?**_ Or maybe an even better question is: _**Do they actually exist in the wild, or are they a scientific creation, such as through genetic engineering?**_ They're as mind-boggling as naked mole rats.\n\n##### The Pet-Owner's Gaze As Power Dynamic\n- It's impossible to really talk about the sandkings without also talking about Simon Kress, their owner and the ostensible protagonist (if not hero) of the story. \n- Kress' relationship to the sandkings is ostensibly ==panoptic, quite literally a relationship built around watching them:== he buys them as entertainment and keeps them in a clear tank that allows them to view them from above. \n- The sandkings' ability to look back up at him is limited by their small size, his great height and distance, and the rather more pressing matter of the other sandkings trying to kill them. \n- The sandkings can only escape Kress' perception by burrowing underground or remaining within their castles, while Kress can fully evade and manipulate the sandkings' perceptions of him through leaving the vicinity of the tank and changing the hologram of his face that he willingly and voluntarily provides them. \n- More, while Kress can always affect the sandkings--through giving or withholding food, manipulating their environment, stabbing them from above, and so on--the sandkings in turn cannot affect him in turn without leaving the tank.\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23095578/217156411-570363fc-a081-4aff-bf2c-6036d985c7b9.png)\n- The power relations at play between Kress and the sandkings have elements of the **[[Permanent Notes/Panopticon]]**, the ==system of surveillance and social control== theorized by Michel Foucault, as well as a **colonial** setup with ==Kress acting the part of surveilling colonizer to the sandkings' observed colonial subjects. ==\n  - The gaze signifies ==the power of the colonizer--the power to perceive==--and the story shows us how this is detrimental to the sandkings, as under Kress' abusive gaze they are no longer \"courtly ritual warriors\" but starving, desperate, and angry. \n  - The text likewise shows the ways in which the colonized can strike back: at first subversively, through the art that the sandkings make of Kress, and then more openly, through their conquest of his home. (#TeamSandkings, btw.)\n- ==Colonized and colonizer alike are scarred by the relationship of domination:== the sandkings are warped and traumatized, both while Kress is in control and even after they escape the tank. Kress, meanwhile, eventually begins to be subsumed into the telepathic hive-mind himself and is later forced to flee his home, but even before the sandkings escape, we see how the sandkings bring out his worst tendencies, encouraging him to make insane choices that center them, and his obsession with and control over them, in his life. \n\n##### Sandkings, Unite\n- Ultimately, \"Sandkings\" is a story about power-- ==the power we wield over those we perceive, the ways in which the powerful and the seemingly powerless interact, what power does to us all. ==\n- It's also just a really fun story about a terrible asshole of a man and the incredibly interesting bugs with which he becomes obsessed. \n- It's a great example of part of the course's spirit: ==our encounter with the alien, our recognition that the alien is at once more different from and more similar to us than we realized, and the ways in which we are changed by this recognition.==\n\n**Discussion Questions**\n1. Do you think the sandkings' status as bug aliens affects the reading of them as colonial subjects?\n2. Pick one of the sandking colonies. Discuss what your chosen colony represents in terms of oppression and how the oppressed respond to it.\n3. \"Sandkings\" focuses a lot on the sandkings' portraits of Simon Kress--Jala Wo explicitly describes them as \"worshipping\" their owners. Do you think the story is making a point about worship? If so, what is it? If not, what else might this theme be trying to interrogate?\n4. From a biological perspective, why are bugs so common in science fiction, especially as hostile invading alien races?\n\n#### Love, Death \u0026 Robots (\"The Swarm\") - Oops, All Bugs\n- The sixth episode of the third season of¬†_Love,_¬†_Death \u0026 Robots_¬†introduces us to the Swarm, an alien species that seems like the 2020's answer to the Zerg or the Tyranids. \n- The creatures of the Swarm are a teeming collective with all the characteristics of a classic bug alien hive: multiple specialized castes that work together, a central queen, and a mode of communication that is complex, sophisticated, and largely impenetrable to humans. \n\t- (Although the Swarm uses pheromones and chemical signals, funnily enough much closer to how actual eusocial insects communicate than the psychic hive mind trope that defamiliarizes real-world ant and bee communication.)\n![[images/Pasted image 20230208004402.png]]\n\n- The Swarm is also an example of another classic science fiction trope, one that often occurs in combination with the alien bug trope: the **assimilator**, ==a type of creature that integrates other species into itself. ==\n\t- When combined with the alien bug, the assimilator trope produces inhuman hordes of creatures that are often described as ravenous spacefaring locusts, devouring entire worlds and integrating their native sapient and non-sapient populations into themselves to create new breeds and castes. \n\t- Semiotically, this takes the alien-as-inhuman-Other image that is so associated with the bug alien and takes it a step further: the assimilating bug alien is an Other that is not only inhuman, but an inhuman Other that is potentially capable of taking what is human and transforming it into something inhuman. Other-ness as infection, as contagious, as disease. \n- If you want to read ==alien hives as a defamiliarization of collectivist societies as imagined by predominantly white writers from individualistic Global North cultures==, it's pretty telling that such writers often write these swarms to be actively bent on **expansion**, as if the biological ability to assimilate necessarily brings with it the desire to do so (or alternatively reinforces it, as if expansionism is a natural, assumed way of thinking, which is itself an interesting notion to unpack). \n\t- In that same vein, it might be worth exploring how this trope lines up with ==how the Global North has portrayed collectivist cultures, philosophies, and ideologies in general==, but that's a whole 'nother thing. (I imagine that for many writers, envisioning conquest as literal biological assimilation, outside of any statements about collectivism, whether implied or intentional, is just too tempting a metaphor to pass up!)\n![[images/Pasted image 20230208004717.png]]\n- But in \"Swarm,\" the titular creatures aren't conquerors or genetic expansionists--they're a largely insular, defensive species, one that seems to defend its own territories and assimilate invaders into itself but otherwise not possess a drive for conquest. \n\t- The queen isn't a psychic warlord; if we're to believe Dr. Mirny, the queen is primarily a producer of offspring, much closer to real-world insect queens. \n\t- The Swarm is framed as an impregnable biological fortress, an inscrutable machine that humanity wishes to penetrate with its gaze rather than an all-consuming tsunami that \"we\" must halt.\n- I say \"penetrate\" deliberately--==just as the gaze is a tool of domination, so too can \"understanding\" be one of violence, as careless categorization can flatten complex rationalities into oversimplified caricatures and pave the way towards exploitation==, as demonstrated by Dr. Afriel's plan for the Swarm's creatures. \n\t- When we impose labels without leaving space for nuance or complexity--when we use our knowledge to speak over and pigeonhole other intelligences without allowing them to speak for themselves or share their own knowledges with us--==we too are attempting a kind of assimilation==, a subsuming of other rationalities into our own systems of knowledge, misrecognizing the Other and seeing only their Other-ness and how we ourselves define it. \n\t- (Put plainly: relating to other people purely through our own preconceptions and preexisting biases, rather than allowing ourselves to meet them as they present themselves and speak of themselves, is a really shitty way to get to know anyone.)\n![[images/Pasted image 20230208004847.png]]\n- What the Swarm does with Dr. Mirny and Dr. Afriel--take direct control of the former via a \"brain\" caste specializing in intelligence, coerce the latter into breeding with Mirny (or Mirny's body) and raising humans loyal to the Swarm--is as terrifying as it is inhuman, and certainly plays into the horror-esque tropes associated with assimilator aliens. \n\t- But the brain creature claims to only be a few weeks old; if we believe it, it seems as though this behavior is simply the Swarm's way of retaliating against an invader who'd sought to control it first (the \"brain\" explicitly says its creation is the result of \"certain genetic protocols\" being triggered by Afriel's experiments). \n- If \"Sandkings\" showed us a nightmarish, hyperbolized version of ==colonized subjects speaking back to their abusive colonizer in the colonizer's own languages==, \"Swarm\" shows us another side of the coin: ==a \"people\" that refuses to be colonized==, that refuses colonizer definitions even up to and including their conception of being a political collective or a \"people\" at all, that uses a prospective conqueror's own methods against them while remaining fundamentally unknowable, such that as the colonizer seeks to pigeonhole the alien into human categories, the only \"human\" knowledge they find in the alien is their own face weaponized against them.\n\n**Discussion Points**\n1.  Dr. Afriel claims that because the Swarm creatures are nonsentient, breeding a Swarm queen and having her create a nest loyal to humanity would not harm anyone, as the human-controlled Swarm creatures wouldn't be \"staring up at the stars pining for their freedom.\" Ignoring the ramifications of such an endeavor on the intergalactic balance of power,¬†**assuming humanity actually could create and control a new Swarm queen and nest, do you think this would be as harmless or victimless an endeavor as Afriel claims?**\n2.  **\"Intelligence is not a winning survival trait.\"**¬†Discuss.\n3.  Discuss #2 in line with the brain creature's description of the Swarm's strategies when confronted with hostile aliens (\"[breeding] smarter, tougher versions of their [races] to fight them\") as well as its own stated specialty likewise being intelligence.¬†**Is the brain creature contradicting itself?**\n\n#### \"The Great Silence\" - Reimagine the Humble Parrot\nWe can attempt to talk about this in a number of ways (any number of which, if you wish, you can elaborate on in the discussion board):\n\n1.  What did you think of the work? Is this the kind of text you enjoy?\n2.  How does the text re/imagine parrots? How does it affect the way we view them?\n3.  What statement is the text offering about intelligence, sound, and the ways in which we see them?\n4.  If \"The Great Silence\" uses parrots as signifiers, what does it use them to signify? Do you think the signifier-signified model even applies to a work like this?\n5.  The story mentions the [[Permanent Notes/Fermi Paradox]]. What are some reasons why we haven't heard (as far as we know) from extraterrestrial life, even if they're likely out there?\n6.  The¬†_novum_¬†here is the premise: the narrator of the text is a parrot speaking to us, the audience. But you can also argue that this work might be considered nonfiction rather than science fiction,¬†_if_¬†you take the narrator parrot as a literary device rather than a literal presentation of a parrot who knows this much and is telling us about it. Do you have a view about what genre label or expectations to apply to this work? Do you think it matters?¬†\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T15:56:57.00413649Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2023-02-09":{"title":"2023-02-09","content":"## Biology of Science Fiction\n#BIO21i #biology #sciencefiction \n### Module 3: Origins, Life, and Species\n#### Origins, Endings, and Evolution\n![[images/Pasted image 20230209001919.png]]\n- Speculative evolution is the science and/or art of looking at the long, rich, complex history of how life came to be as it is on our planet and saying, ==\"Okay, but what if...?\" ==\n\t- We do this for a variety of reasons: because it's an interesting thought exercise, because we want to extrapolate from known patterns and take stock of how far life has come and imagine where it might yet go. Imagining the fantastic ways in which life on Earth could develop (or might have developed, in an alternate timeline) is something we do as scientists and as fictionists for any number of reasons, up to and including the fact that it's just plain fun.\n- But why do we find this exercise so compelling?\n\t- One reason is, of course, the fact that the creatures of speculative evolution are cool. As many of you will no doubt agree, the power of cool creatures can never be underestimated. And it's even cooler when we bring actual research and scientific grounding into the exercise, because it allows us to see that the same principles which keep our world familiar to us can also be extrapolated to create things that are both unlike anything we've ever seen and at the same time utterly plausible.\n\t- Where this all gets much more loaded is the concept of **speculative¬†_human_¬†evolution**: ==the exploration of the idea that there might be other kinds of people that we might become in the future or who may already be sharing the planet with us.== We ascribe a lot of value and weight to the term \"human,\" a word that has both social and biological connotations, and so the idea that there might be other types of creatures that might lay claim to the term on a social/identity level despite not being \"like us\" biologically is an idea to which humanity has always had varied and intense reactions, to say the least.\n![[images/Pasted image 20230209002243.png]]\n- As we know from science fiction in general, our questions about the future are really questions about the present: ==\"What will happen next?\" is really a question about what's happening now that we can't see==, and ==\"Who will we become?\" is really a question about who we already are.==\n\t- We see this tendency in our creation stories from religion and mythology: if you believe that humanity was shaped by hand in the image and likeness of God, for example, that's a metaphorical statement about our nature, value, and place in the universe. \n\t- Creationists thus might react violently to the idea that we are the product of random chance, because that can be read as an implicit denial of the idea behind the creationist credo: the belief that humanity is uniquely valued by a divine being who deliberately shaped us a certain way. \n\t- ==The story we believe about how we came to be is also, implicitly, the story we tell ourselves about why we are the way we are.== And you can project this logic forwards as well as backwards: a story about where you think we're going is really a statement about where you think we are now, and about our response to that. If you believe we will become better people in the future, that's also a belief that in the present, we¬†_can_.\n\n#### Origin of Life on Planets\n- In the previous Module, we discussed the diversity of life-forms on science fiction planets, with an emphasis on how evolution explains this biodiversity. Let's now look at how all of this life could begin on a planet in the first place. As I'm sure you've come to appreciate by now, evolution plays a very important role in that as well.\n- Not a lot of sci-fi goes so far as to explain the origins of their home-world and the beginning of life on them. Perhaps not surprisingly, this is usually important only in sci-fi universes that are featured across several novels, with the books showcasing different planets and species. In this way, the origin of life in these universes serves as an explanation and common thread for the diversity in the books. \n\t- In such sci-fi universes, ==the shared origin of species can be considered its own¬†_novum_.== \n\t- The two most apparent examples are Larry Niven's¬†_Known Space Universe_¬†and Ursula Le Guin's¬†_Hainish Cycle_. What they have in common is the idea of a ==hyper-advanced species intentionally seeding other planets.== We actually have a term for that in biology:¬†**directed panspermia**. Why does biology have a term for a trope in science fiction? Well, that's because panspermia isn't completely sci-fi.\n- Before we go into how¬†_life_¬†can begin on a planet, let's first talk about what types of planets can have life in the first place. For that, we need to begin with what provides the energy for the sustenance of life on any world: the stars. **[Episode 7 - World-building 101: O M G! Star Classes and Life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxwQ9tYKIIU)**\n\t- So, not all stars are viable candidates for hosting planets that have life. You might want to keep this in mind when creating your own sci-fi world.\n\n**Points for Discussion**\n1. What types are of stars are most likely to host life on their satellite planets? Why?\n2. Do you think sci-fi authors should be more deliberate in identifying the type of host star of their created worlds? Why or why not?\n\n- So now you have your host star. For obvious reasons, a great majority of sci-fi takes place on rocky planets, but of course there's nothing stopping you from creating one that happens entirely on a gaseous planet! \n- However, the environmental conditions (i.e. gasses, rocks, minerals, water availability, pressure, gravity, temperature, etc.) on your planet would definitely matter in shaping the life that evolves on that planet, because those environmental conditions will serve as the¬†**evolutionary pressures**¬†that will determine the ==survivability== of the various life-forms. \n- But even before we talk about the evolution of life, we have to explore first how life could begin in the first place in a barren, lifeless world. Did life on a planet come from pre-existing life outside the planet (**panspermia**), or did it develop¬†_in situ_¬†from non-living environmental components? Or is it some combination of the two? Watch this next video for an overview of the well-accepted ideas on how life could have began on our own planet: **[Episode 20 - World-Building 101: How Life Can Begin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAyvAiJooPo)**\n- In many ways, panspermia is the most exciting among the three origin hypotheses given the extraterrestrial source and even the possibility of a hyper-intelligent alien species having a hand in our beginnings! \n\t- So it shouldn't be surprising that Niven's and Le Guin's universes are built on that idea. \n\t- Heck, even the anime mega-franchise¬†_Neon Genesis Evangelion_¬†uses it to explain the origins of humans, Evangelions, and Angels!¬†\n\t- In the episode of¬†_Star Trek: The Next Generation_¬†entitled \"The Chase,\" which is one of our primary references for this Module, panspermia is also used as an explanation for the diversity of intelligent life in the¬†_Star Trek_¬†universe.\n\n**Points for Discussion**\n1. Think of a¬†_novum_¬†for one of the three origin hypotheses OR your own \"origin of life\"¬†_novum_.¬†\n2. How does \"The Chase\" use panspermia to support the bigger themes that the¬†_Star Trek_¬†franchise has been exploring?\n\n#### Genetics and Evolution\n##### A Brief Review of Basic Genetics\n![[images/Pasted image 20230209163611.png]]\n- You've likely heard it said before: ==our genes determine who we are.¬†==\n- **Genes**¬†are found on chromosomes (those things in the nucleus that move around and are split apart during mitosis, which all of you know) and are made up of, among others,¬†**DNA**¬†(deoxyribonucleic acid), which structurally consists of a sugar (carbohydrate, one of the four organic compounds), a phosphate group, and four¬†**nitrogenous bases**, namely adenine (A), cytostine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T). DNA contains the information on who we are as a species and as an individual, primarily depending on the sequence of those nitrogenous bases.¬†\n- How does that actually work? The short of it is this:\n\t- In¬†**replication**, the double-stranded, helical DNA molecule unwinds and each strand becomes independent of the other, thus leaving each strand to bind with another strand. But because of the unique pairing of bases (adenine with thymine and cytosine with guanine, as seen in the topmost figure), ==the resulting two DNA molecules are identical to the parent DNA molecule.== This DNA replication is what happens during S phase of interphase prior to mitosis and is the main way by which genetic material is copied from parent cell to daughter cell.\n\t- During a process called¬†**transcription**, one strand of an unwound DNA molecule binds not with another strand of DNA but with a strand of¬†**RNA**¬†(ribonucleic acid), a different type of nucleic acid from DNA. Specifically, this RNA is called¬†**messenger RNA**¬†or¬†**mRNA**. Like DNA, it consists of a sugar, a phosphate group, and four nitrogenous bases, but instead of thymine it has uracil (U). It's the unique pairing of adenine to uracil and of guanine to cytosine that allows the binding of two strands of nucleic acids. The mRNA molecule will detach from the DNA strand that it used as a template so that it can move to the next step.\n\t- During¬†**translation**, the mRNA strand, being on its own and thus capable of binding with another nucleic acid strand, binds with another RNA molecule, but this time it's¬†**transfer RNA**¬†or¬†**tRNA**. There are two very important things to note in this process: \n\t\t1) tRNA binds to the mRNA template in clusters of three nitrogenous bases (e.g. AUG, GGU, CGA, etc.) called a¬†**triplet codon**¬†\n\t\t2) each tRNA triplet codon brings with it an¬†**amino acid**¬†(like glutamic acid, serine, lysine, methionine, etc.), which is the building block of proteins. \n\t\t3) So essentially, an mRNA template will produce a string of amino acids whose identity is determined by the specific triplet codon. For example, AUG always codes for methionine. This coding system, which we believe to be universal to all life (at least all carbon-based life!), is called the¬†**genetic code**. When the amino acids are strung together and detach from the tRNA molecules that had carried them, we now have a¬†**polypeptide**¬†or more commonly referred to as a protein.\n![[images/Pasted image 20230209163933.png]]\n\n- What's the importance of producing proteins from the specific DNA base sequence? \n\t- In many ways, ==our protein make-up determines who we are==, because proteins are extremely important structural components (i.e. they make up or muscles, hair, nails, cell membranes, skin, eyes, etc.), are used as enzymes (which catalyze chemical reactions, including those involved in transcription and translation), and even determine our behaviors, which are mediated by specific pairings between proteins and cell receptors! \n\t- These processes involving DNA coding for our protein make-up is so central to our genetic identity and physical traits that collectively, they are referred to as ==the¬†**Central Dogma**¬†of molecular biology.==\n\n##### Biological Evolution\n-  One good definition of evolution is¬†==_gradual genetic change at the population level_.== Let's dissect that definition. \n\t- Evolution is, first and foremost, ==change.== Organisms change over time; they are not static. Most of these changes are accounted for by¬†**mutations**, which are ==random (i.e. unpredictable) changes in our genes== (such as in the sequence of our nitrogenous bases, and now you can appreciate what that would mean!). \n\t- By gradual, we mean not necessarily that evolution takes a very long time (some evolutionary events have taken only decades!), but that it's usually ==an accumulation of small, incremental changes== instead of one big sudden mutation. \n\t\t- For example, the evolution of amphibians from fish involved independent changes in the shape of the head, the development of the ribs, the position of the eyes, the shaping of the limb bones, etc. We say it's genetic change because only traits that can be passed from one generation to the next (i.e. heritable) can be subject to evolution. \n\t- And lastly, individuals do not evolve. If you suddenly grow wings, sorry but you ain't evolving, my friend! Evolution works on the level of the¬†**population**, which is ==a group of organisms of the same species living together in the same place and interbreeding.== We see this through changes in the frequencies of¬†**alleles**¬†in a population over time. \n\t\t- Simply put, alleles are alternative forms of genes. For example, the gene for seed color can have the yellow allele and the green allele. If there has been a significant change in the proportions of alleles in a population (i.e. the number of individuals bearing the alleles) over time, then evolution is happening.\n- Here's a very good example to illustrate that: there is a species of moth that's quite common in North American and European forests called the peppered moth (_Biston betularia_). There are commonly two forms: the white¬†_B. betularia_¬†f.¬†_typica_¬†bearing the allele for white coloration and the black¬†_B. betularia_¬†f.¬†_carbonaria_¬†bearing the allele for black coloration. \n\t- Prior to the industrial revolution, when the air was much cleaner and the trees' trunks were covered in lichen and thus gave them a white color, the white form was much more common than the black, having allele frequencies of 0.80 (i.e. 80% of individuals have the allele and are thus white) or higher. \n\t- This was because white moths that perched on the tree trunks blended with their surroundings, whereas the black moths stood out like a sore thumb. Guess what the birds ate? The frequency of the black allele was so low because most black moths were being eaten before they could mate, produce offspring, and pass on their alleles for black color to the next generation!\n\t- But when the industrial revolution created soot and ash that over centuries killed the lichen and coated the tree trunks, thus darkening them, the fates of the two forms were reversed: now it was the white ones that stood out and were being eaten by the predatory birds. This caused a drastic reversal in the allele frequencies, with the black moths becoming much more dominant. Thus, this is evolution at work on the population level. And bird predation was the major evolutionary pressure here (though human activity had its part in influencing the evolutionary trajectory of the species).\n![[images/Pasted image 20230209164319.png]]\n\n- That, my friends, is evolution in a nutshell, particularly Darwinian evolution (named after the man Charles Darwin, who introduced us to the concept of¬†**variation**).¬†\n- **Natural selection**¬†is but one of several mechanisms for evolution but it's the most popular one. It's based on ==competition for resources and the consistent differences in the fitness of individuals in an environment==; some individuals are more fit than others, and thus they will outcompete others and survive. \n\t- Biologically speaking,¬†**fitness**¬†is ==the ability of an organism to reproduce and pass on its genes to the next generation.== Traits that raise fitness are called¬†**adaptations**.¬†\n\t- So in the¬†_B. betularia_¬†example, the white form had higher fitness prior to the industrial revolution, then the black form had higher fitness after its onset; their colors were adaptations against bird predation. As you can imagine, the fitness of an individual or of a group of individuals will depend on what's happening to the environment at any given moment. ==So what's fit at one time will not necessarily be fit all the time, and the strongest and largest aren't always the fittest!== That's what makes the term \"survival of the fittest\" rather problematic.\n- One very good way to understand more about what evolution is is to understand what it¬†**is not**. Watch **[Episode 5 - How Pop Culture Usually Gets Science and Evolution Wrong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-T7rzM5pis)**\n\n**Points for Discussion**\n1. Relate panspermia to evolution in explaining the diversity of species coming from the same origin in sci-fi universes.\n2. Relate the concept of fitness to the Evolutionary Arms Race.\n3. Relate the concept of the niche to what you've just learned in evolution.\n4. What does \"The Chase\" say about DNA and evolution that is not necessarily consistent with the widely accepted biological views?\n5. What ideas have¬†_you_¬†had about evolution that you now know are misconceptions?\n\n## Discerning Life Questions\n\u003e **Articulating Your Life Question** + 300-word explanation\n\n**\"Why do I constantly feel anguish when it comes to dance?\"**\n\nOutline:\n- dance is my main passion\n- however, it is also a huge source of stress for me\n- recount what happened in the past year\n\nI consider dance as one of my core passions in life. Ever since I decided to pursue it seriously half a decade ago, it has been an integral part of my identity and lifestyle. My day isn't complete without going to a dance class, training with teammates, or simply exercising on my own. And so many of my most treasured relationships ‚Äî friends and mentors ‚Äî came from dance. However, it has also been a huge source of stress for me. Most of the traumatic experiences I've had are related to dance, such as the following: failing to make the competition team in high school three years in a row, and having to leave my old dance studio, which turned out to be a toxic environment. To be honest, I feel like I'm struggling as a member of CADs right now; in this past year, I got rejected from most of the org opportunities I applied for (e.g. deputy positions, competition team line-ups, involvement in core projects).

In his inspirational talk, Guy Winch tells us that ==‚Äúyou can‚Äôt treat a psychological wound if you don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre injured‚Äù.== Guy teaches us a lesson on why it is so important to practice emotional hygiene.\n\n- Types of Psychological Wounds\n\t- **Loneliness**\n\t\t- [[Loneliness creates a deep psychological wound]] -- one that distorts our perceptions and scrambles our thinking. \n\t\t\t- It makes us believe that those around us care much less than they actually do.\n\t\t\t- It makes us really afraid to reach out because why set yourself up for rejection and heartache when your heart is already aching more than you can stand?\n\t\t- Happens even when you're surrounded by people. Why? Loneliness is defined purely ==subjectively.==\n\t\t\t- It depends solely on whether you feel emotionally or socially disconnected from those around you\n\t\t- Loneliness can kill you\n\t\t- It's important to ==pay attention to emotional pain== because psychological wounds are also capable of killing you. But you can't treat them if you don't know that you're injured in the first place.\n\t- **Failure**\n\t\t- We all have a ==default set of feelings and beliefs== that gets triggered whenever we encounter frustrations and setbacks\n\t\t- Our mind is hard to change once we become convinced\n\t\t\t- So it might be very natural to feel demoralized and defeated after you fail but you cannot allow yourself to become convinced you can't succeed\n\t\t\t- You have to fight feelings of helplessness you have to gain control over the situation and you have to break this kind of negative cycle before it begins\n\t- **Rejection**\n\t\t- [[Permanent Notes/Stop emotional bleeding]]\n\t\t\t- Our minds and feelings aren't as trustworthy as we'd like them to be\n\t\t\t- After a rejection, we usually start thinking of all our faults and all our shortcomings, what we wish we were, what we wish we weren't...\n\t\t\t- Our self-esteem is already hurting; why would we want to go and damage it even further?\n\t\t\t- We exacerbate our psychological injuries because of poor emotional hygeine \n\t\t\t- Instead, the first thing you should be doing after a rejection is ==reviving your self-esteem==\n\t- **Ruminate**\n\t\t- Protect your self-esteem\n\t\t\t- When you're in emotional pain, you have to ==treat yourself with the same compassion== you would expect from a truly good friend\n\t\t\t- We have to catch our unhealthy psychological habits, one of which is rumination (a.k.a. replaying/dwelling on upsetting events)\n\t\t\t- Spending so much time on negative thoughts makes you more vulnerable to alcoholism, depression, eating disorders, etc.\n\t\t\t- Studies show that even a two-minute distraction is sufficient to break the urge to ruminate in that moment.\n- Takeaway: by taking action when you're lonely, by changing your responses to failure, by protecting your self-esteem, by battling negative thinking, you won't just heal your psychological wounds -- you will build ==emotional resilience.==\n\n### Stress\nWhile¬†**emotional hygiene**¬†is something that happens¬†_within_¬†us,¬†**stress**¬†is something that happens¬†_to_¬†us from without.¬†\nThus, it would also be good to talk about stress--but in a different and more constructive way:\n**[How to make stress your friend | Kelly McGonigal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGyVTAoXEU)**\n\u003e Stress. It makes your heart pound, your breathing quicken and your forehead sweat. But while stress has been made into a public health enemy, new research suggests that stress may only be bad for you if you believe that to be the case. Psychologist Kelly McGonigal urges us to see stress as a positive, and introduces us to an unsung mechanism for stress reduction: ==reaching out to others.==\n\n- Mindblowing study insights\n\t- ==People who experienced a lot of stress but did not view stress as harmful== were no more likely to die; in fact, they had the lowest risk of dying of anyone in the study, including people who had relatively little stress.\n\t- 182 000 americans died prematurely not from stress but from the ==belief== that stress is bad for you.\n- When you change your ==mind== about stress, you can change your ==body's response== to stress.\n- Oxytocin\n\t- also known as ==\"the cuddle hormone\"== because it is released whenever you hug someone\n\t- oxytocin is a neurohormone it fine-tunes your brain's social instincts it primes you to do things that strengthen close relationships\n\t- oxytocin makes you crave physical contact with your friends and family itenhances your empathy it even makes you more willing to help and support the people you care about\n\t- What most people don't know: oxytocin is a stress hormone\n\t\t- when oxytocin is released, it is motivating you to seek support. Your biological stressresponse is nudging you to tell someone how you feel instead of bottling it up. Your stress response wants to make sure you notice when someone else in your life is struggling so that you can support each other when life is difficult. Your stress response wants you to be surrounded by people who care about you.\n\t\t- oxytocin doesn't only act on your brain it also acts on your body and one of its main roles in your body is to protect your cardiovascular systemfrom the effects of stress\n\t- Your stress response has a built-in mechanism for stress resilience and that mechanism is ==human connection==. [[Human connection is the built-in mechanism for stress resilience]]\n- Takeaways\n\t- When you choose to view your stress response as helpful, you create the ==biology of courage==\n\t- When you choose to connect with others under stress, you can create resilience.

To guide our thinking in this module, we will anchor our discussions on this essential question¬†==**\"Who is an educated person?\"**==\n\n#### What if you lived during the middle ages?\nThere are 2 themes that describe the backdrop for Medieval education:\n1. **Moral Degeneracy**\n\t1. Prior to this time, the Early Christian Church was born. However, (and Jesus would not have been happy about this) the church grew much in terms of structure and rituals, but have often fallen short in terms of moral practice. \n\t2. It was present as an institution but it focused more on the ==ceremonies== than on living a Christlike life.\n2. **Individualistic Feudalism and Rise of the Classes**\n\t1. Kings, knights, lords, slaves, etc. \n\t2. This was also a time when several Kingdoms rose to power where ==a hierarchy of social class== was prominent.\n\nThis video (**[What If You Lived During the Middle Ages?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydXi-KiMv7o)**) gives you a bird's eye view of what life was like during the middle/dark ages.¬† As you watch the video, take note of the following: the ==social classes== that emerged during this period, and the ==knowledge and skills== that were valued by each social class.\n\n\u003e¬†_If you lived during the medieval period, what kind of education would you need not only to survive but to thrive_?\n\nAs you saw in the video, the Medieval times is a mixed bag, but what's clear is that it's given rise to some \"personalities\" that can clue us into what education was like then: ==the monk, the scholastic, the knight and the craftsman.==\n\n### The monk and the scholastic\n_First, we will look into two forms of education that believed in the pursuit of purity and the intellect: [[Monasticism]] and [[Scholasticism]]._\n\n#### The religious men\n- These first two characters in medieval education anchored the conception of an educated man on religious piety, giving rise to two forms of education - [[monasticism]] and scholasticism. \n- If you think about it - ==\"the religious person\" as the educated person is not really an outdated paradigm.== In the Philippines alone a lot of the first schools were established by religious orders (the Jesuits included), and continues to put front and center the ideal Christian as an ideal person, but how similar or different was their perspective then in comparison to the present?\n\n#### The monk: Ora et Labora (Prayer and Labor)\n- When you think of monks, one of the first things that probably come to mind is a ==solitary life. ==\n\t- Remember that one of the contexts that gave birth to this was the ==un-christlike behaviors of Christians. ==\n\t- Therefore, one of the big ideas of Monasticism is to ==stay away from things that are \"worldly\". ==Thus, the seclusion. \n- So, if [[monasticism]] suggests a solitary life, away from the affairs of the world,¬† how could it have influenced education?\n- A starting point is to distinguish between two forms of monasticism - **anchoritic** and the **cenobitic**.¬† \n\t- The **anchoritic** form called for pure seclusion.\n\t- The **cenobitic** form allowed monks to live in small communities and form monasteries. These monasteries were developed into educational institutions.\n\n\u003e _\"The monasteries were the schools, the libraries, the publishing houses, the literary centers, the hospitals, and the workshops of medieval time\" (Wilds and Lottich, 1965)._\n\n##### A Mini Guide to Medieval Monks\nWhat was monastic life like? Here's a brief overview: **[A Mini Guide to Medieval Monks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbT6IkMQxck)**\n\u003e There were many different religious communities in medieval Britain. Many of English Heritage‚Äôs religious sites were once home to one of the four major monastic movements ‚Äì the Benedictines, Cluniacs, Carthusians and Cistercians. But do you know the difference between these religious orders?\n- **Benedictines**\n\t- At the core of the Benedictine day was communal prayer; everyday the monks gathered in church to sing eight services\n\t- Time was also set aside for reading and manual work\n\t- Monasteries also had an obligation to offer hospitality to travellers and alms to the poor\n\t- The Rule of St. Benedict was summed up with the motto \"Pray and Work\"\n- **Cluniacs**\n\t- The Cluniacs wanted a grander style of worship. So their interpretation of the Rule called for a celebration of God through beautiful art, architecture, and elaborate services.\n\t- Servants did most of the manual labor\n- **Cistercians**\n\t- The Cluniac life was too opulent for the Cistercians\n\t- Monasteries were plain and secluded\n\t- Services were shorter, and they farmed and carried out their own manual labor\n\t- Aim: simpler, more austere spiritual life\n- **Carthusians**\n\t- The most austere out of all the orders\n\t- Wore hooded robes, only came together for a few services each day, and unlike other orders, lived and prayed in solitary cells\n- Henry VIII suddenly dissolved all the moansteries; this forced those who committed to religious communities to step out into an uncertain future\n\n##### The 6 Key Features of [[Monasticism]] Lecture\n- [[Monasticism]] comes from the Greek word ***monos***, meaning **alone**.\n\t- Sets the context for [[Monasticism]], since this is a form of education born from the experiences of monks who secluded themselves from the rest of society\n- 6 Key Features\n\t- **Aim:** ==\"salvation of individual souls\"== \n\t\t- Context: this type of education was a response to the degrading quality of Christianity\n\t\t- Through... (methods)\n\t\t\t- Bodily mortification\n\t\t\t- World renunciation -- chastity, poverty, obedience \n\t\t\t\t- Described as **[[Permanent Notes/Ascetism]]:** the ==disciplining== of all ==bodily desires== and ==all human affections and aspirations== so that the mind and soul might be devoted to the interests of the higher life.\n\t\t\t\t- This works with the assumption that the higher life cannot mix with the worldly life\n\t- **Type:** Moral and Religious education\n\t\t- Types of training\n\t\t\t- Literary Training: reading, copying, and writing of manuscripts\n\t\t\t- Manual Training: agriculture (for men), skilled artisanship (wood, metal, leather), embroidery\n\t\t- Motivation behind these\n\t\t\t- Rule of Benedict: \"==Idleness is the great enemy== of the soul, therefore the monks shall always be occupied either in manual labor or holy reading\"\n\t- **Content:** Seven Liberal Arts (grammar, rhetoric, dialectic, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, music)\n\t\t- Also done in service of the church/religion\n\t\t\t- \"The novitates were required to learn to ==read== in order to ==study the sacred books==; to ==write== in order to ==copy manuscripts==; to ==sing== in order to take part in ==religious ceremonies==; and to ==calculate== so that they could ==compute the time of the church festivals==\"\n\t- **Agency \u0026 Organization:** Monastic schools\n\t\t- Boys admitted at age 10, and enters the order at 18\n\t\t- Later on, \"outsiders\" were admitted too *(interni v.s. externi)*\n\t\t\t- Externi: those coming from the external world\n\t\t\t- Interni: those who decided to stay to continue living a religious life\n\t- **Method:**\n\t\t- Cathethical: question \u0026 answer method\n\t\t- Dictation: since they had limited copies of the manuscripts\n\t\t- Meditation \u0026 Contemplation\n\t\t- Corporal Punishment (use of the rod)\n- Takeaway question: Who was the **educated person** in [[Monasticism]]?\n- Finally, to deepen your understanding, read more about Monastic Education, you may do so in¬†this excerpt.\n\n\n\u003e 1. What feature of Monastic Education did you find most interesting? Include a brief quote from the text about this.\n\u003e 2. Describe the educated person in monastic education.\n\nWhat I found most interesting about Monastic Education was the motivation behind keeping the monks constantly busy. This was because they worried that having too much free time could make one vulnerable to \"tempation or brooding\". As declared by the Rule of Benedict: \"Idleness is the great enemy of the soul.\" I can't help but think of how similar this aim is to modern productivity culture, where people try to optimize their time in order to do as much as possible; workaholics like me are most guilty of this.\n\nThe educated person in monastic education is a single-minded devotee. Similar to the Spartans, who dedicated their whole lives to the state, educated monks dedicated their whole lives to God. They sacrificed their bodies (through phsical torment) and relationships (with the home, economy, and state); they   believed that this would free them from worldy tempations, which would allow them to fully focus on studying and serving God (which can be seen in the purely religious content of their education).\n\n#### The scholastic: Faith and Reason\n\u003e Let's start this section with this question:¬†What is the relationship of **faith** and **reason?**\n\n![[images/Look at something beautiful for a long time.png]]\n\n- The late middle period (11th to 12th century) was a time of peace and¬† intellectual activities.¬† People now began to speculate about Church doctrines, which were previously accepted unquestioningly. This resulted in pursuing theology with more vigor and hence the start of scholasticism as a movement.¬† [[Scholasticism]] aimed to ==support the doctrines of the church using rational argument.==\n- Malik Shawal in his article¬†[Scholasticism: Nature, Purpose and Method of Education](https://www.yourarticlelibrary.com/education/scholasticism-nature-purpose-and-method/69156)provides an overview of the educational system that developed during this period.\n- One of the prominent characters in Scholasticism is St. Anselm of Canterbury, a Christian Philosopher and Theologian. Here's one of his famous quotes:\n\t- ![[images/Anselm of Canterbury.png]]\n\t- As you read the quote above, think about how similar or different this point of view is with the monks of Monastic education. For the scholastics, [[Faith and reason need not be worlds apart]].\n- Definition of [[Scholasticism]]\n\t- The word ‚Äúscholasticism‚Äù has its roots in the Latin word ‚Äúschola‚Äù which means school. \n\t- In Latin medieval universities, the heads of the schools are called ‚Äúmagistris scholarum‚Äù (masters of the schools) or simply ‚Äúscholastici‚Äù (scholastics or schoolmen). \n\t- During the Medieval times, the scholastici were recognized as the bearers of authentic philosophical and theological views\n- 6 Key Features of [[Scholasticism]]\n\t- **Aim:** intellectual discipline (faith seeking understanding)\n\t\t- The aim of Scholasticism was mainly to be able to ==defend the faith through reason.== This was a response to ==heretics of the church that questioned belief based on faith alone.==\n\t\t- \"Scholastic education sought also to develop the ability to ==formulate beliefs into logical systems== and to ==defend these against any intellectual arguments==\"\n\t\t- Another prominent figure in this time was St. Thomas Aquinas. [One of the most famous prayers attributed to him](https://www.thereligionteacher.com/saint-thomas-aquinas-prayer-before-study/) speaks volumes of what the scholastics believed in.\n\t- **Types \u0026 Content:** Theology and Religious Philosophy (new system of philosophizing about theological beliefs)\n\t\t- Mainly influenced by [Thomas Aquinas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJvoFf2wCBU)\n\t\t- Developed a new understanding of theplace of Reason in human life\n\t\t- His monumental contribution was to teach Western European civilization that ==any human being== (not just a Christian) could have ==access to great truths== whenever they made use of God's greatest gift to human beings: ==reason==\n\t\t\t- He thus universalized intelligence, explaining how one could have both wisdom and no faith in God\n\t\t- The modern world, in so far as it insists that good ideas can come from any quarter regardless of creed or background, remains hugely in Aquinas' debt. \n\t\t\t- This is because he opened the Christian mind to the insights of all of humanity from across the ages and the continents\n\t\t- He proposed that the world could be explored through reason, and not just through faith\n\t\t- He did this by proposing that the universe and all its dynamics operate according to two kinds of law: ==(secular) natural law== and ==(religious) eternal law.==\n\t\t\t- Related to Philo class?\n\t\t- \"Do unto others what you would have done to you\" belongs to natural law, not eternal law\n\t\t\t- this explains how it was a moral cornerstrone even outside of religion\n\t\t- While God can work through eternal law (e.g. miracles), most useful knowledge can be found within the realms of natural law\n\t\t- Ensured that radicalization wouldn't harm intellectual culture (compared to what happened with Islam)\n\t\t- Though Aquinas was a man of deep faith, he provided a philosophical framework for open scientific inquiry; he reminds us that knowledge can and should come from multiple sources (i.e. intuition and rationality, science and revelation, pagans and monks)\n\t- **Agencies:** cathedral schools, monastic schools, universities\n\t\t- Apart from Scholasticism naturally finding its way to Monastic and Cathedral Schools, one of the important contributions of scholastic education is the development of [medieval universities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ly9BPvFJfqo).\n\t- **Methods:** lecture (dictation), debate, syllogism\n\t\t- There were two prominent teaching methods in Scholasticism: The (all too familiar) Lecture - where teachers read text together with students and debates - where a thesis was proposed and objections were raised and refuted.\n\t\t- One of the favorite forms of argument was [syllogism](https://youtu.be/1UmPbfuGfKk) - a form of reasoning that is composed of 3 propositions - a major premise, a minor premise and a conclusion.\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T15:56:57.00413649Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2023-02-14":{"title":"2023-02-14","content":"## Biology of Science Fiction\n#BIO21i #biology #sciencefiction\n### On Human Evolution and Speciation\n- In the 1930 sci-fi classic Last and First Men by Olaf Stapledon, Homo sapiens undergoes drastic evolutionary processes throughout its history that ultimately results in no less than 17 descendant species, with the fourth of those onward being found on other planets, namely Venus and Neptune. Is this the future of our species? Are we even still evolving? Yes, we are still evolving. But not our species as a whole! \n- Remember that ==evolution works on the level of a **population**, which is a group of individuals living together.== Of course, our various modes of transportation complicate that definition and virtually prevent total isolation of any one human population, but the distinction is important. There have been several documented cases of human evolution, such as the following:\n  - Tibetans, living in very high altitudes where there is less oxygen in the air, have more efficient oxygen-utilization mechanisms;\n  - The Buriat tribe of very cold Siberia have wider than normal skulls at the forehead, which by virtue of resulting in a smaller surface area:volume ratio causes less heat to escape through the head;\n  - Certain native African tribes develop a non-lethal form of sickle cell anemia that protects them from malaria;\n  - Alpine dairy-farming communities in Europe have 1.0 frequency for the allele for lactase, allowing them to digest lactose in milk unlike most other people in the world;\n  - The Bajau, who have been free diving for subsistence for a thousand years, have larger than average (as much 50% larger!) spleens, which recycle red blood cells and hold a reserve of blood.\n- These are just a few of the most fascinating and well known examples. As the Bajau example shows you, ==these evolutionary trends can take a relatively short period of time.== \n  - Dairy-farming communities evolved the lactase gene in around 5,000 years. For a species that is only around 200,000 years old, it's important to note these quick evolutionary rates. \n  - Also take note that these are evolutionary events occurring independently in certain human populations; they are not all happening concurrently in all humans! That's what we mean by evolution working on the population level.\n- There has been the question of whether or not the human species is still driven by natural selection the way other organisms are. \n  - Certainly, there are things we can do that other species can't in response to environmental change, such as locking ourselves in a well-stocked, air-conditioned bunker during a nuclear holocaust that will kill most other species. \n  - But as we've seen with the examples above, evolutionary pressures are still working on certain human populations. \n  - Many biologists speculate that disease may be the greatest evolutionary pressure molding our trajectory, with resistance to disease being selected for. This is very timely given the situation that we find ourselves in now.\n- Now let's talk about [[Speciation]]. Recall: evolution and [[Speciation]] are NOT the same process. \n  - As we've seen with Biston betularia, evolution can happen without [[Speciation]]. The mutants of X-Men may be products of evolution but they're not necessarily a new species. \n  - Yes, humans are currently evolving but there is no evidence to suggest that any one human population is speciating. Recall: in order for speciation to occur, there should be reproductive isolation. Rarely is any human group so completely cut-off from the rest of humanity that such isolation can take place.\n\n#### _The Time Machine_\n- Our key reference for this topic is The Time Machine (1895) by H.G. Wells, which supposes that H. sapiens has evolved into two offshoot species: the Eloi and the Morlocks.\n- In the timeless classic, the protagonist (simply called the Traveller), creates a time machine and with it zooms to the future, 802701 AD to be precise. At this time, it seems that H. sapiens as we know it no longer exists, at least in far-future London. \n  - (Who knows what the rest of the world looks like? As we have learned, it's populations that evolve, not entire species, so it's possible that there's still H. sapiens elsewhere on the globe.) \n- In London and probably throughout Great Britain, the pleasant, indolent Eloi live on the surface while the monstrous and cunning Morlocks live underground. Given the absence of H. sapiens, it's reasonable to suspect that both species are offshoots of humans, especially considering that 800,000 years is definitely enough time for speciation to have occurred, as long as there was sufficient reproductive isolation between the two formerly human populations.\n- What could have caused this reproductive isolation? Obviously, it involved keeping one population of humans above the surface and casting away another population below the ground. \n  - Physically, the Eloi represent current humans much more closely than Morlocks do, and the novel makes it a point to emphasize how pretty they are compared to the grotesque, animalistic other. \n  - It's almost impossible not to have a Marxist reading of the book. The distinction between the two new species practically screams \"class struggle!\" \n  - The most obvious sign of this is the presence of the machines underground. Sometime in our future, capitalists force the laborers underground to drive the machinery that keeps the surface world going. \n  - And for the allopatric speciation scenario to work, this means that the laborers weren't just made to work down there and then be able to return to the surface when they're done with work; the Eloi ancestors forced them to stay there! Think miners, but they can't ever leave their place of work. Laws must have been put into place to prevent mixing of the two populations, which could have only meant a social milieu where it became unacceptable for the capitalist elite to interact with the lowly workers. Such a grim future! It's almost completely antithetical to the harmonious future that Star Trek envisions.\n- The physical transformation of the subterranean humans into Morlocks over 800,000 years is typical of speculations on the evolution of animals that are bound to underground habitats. \n  - These animals are called troglobites (a similar word, troglodyte, has been used to refer to humans living in caves and has been co-opted by fantasy literature as a name for any sort of repulsive, barbaric creature, such as in Dungeons \u0026 Dragons). \n  - Typically, troglobites have evolved to have slow metabolism (likely an evolutionary response to the scarcity of food underground compared to above-ground), absence of pigmentation (colors being biologically costly to produce but not useful in caves, whether for display purposes or protection from ultraviolet radiation), and decrease or loss of sight, if not the eyes themselves (which do not fully develop). \n  - The cunning and aggression displayed by the Morlocks, which is atypical of cave denizens, is not surprising given that they are an offshoot of an intelligent species that has had to fight for survival. The cave creature in the excellent 2005 horror film The Descent is another good example of such a creature.\n- In several ways, the Eloi as future human is even more frightening a concept, at least from a biological perspective. Here we have a species that still looks human and yet has lost many of the things that make a human human: strong emotional responses and drives. \n  - The Eloi is a lazy creature reduced to feeding and reproducing out of need, barely stimulated by external forces. In this way, it's easy to argue that Morlocks are even more human. \n  - Eloi seem to have lost even basic survival instincts, which most animals have! \n  - In Wells's view of the world, the capitalists' dependence on and harsh treatment of laborers dehumanizes them, perhaps not physically, but certainly behaviorally.\n  - Honestly, it's difficult to speculate a future where humans reach this level of helpless complacency. Wells's future must have been absolutely utopic (at least above ground), with diseases and senescence and natural disasters a thing of the past, for natural selection to have bred out survival instincts and non-essential desires (which are admittedly energetically costly) from the surface humans! \n  - Anatomically speaking, the Eloi's limbic system (recall: it's the part of the brain that's involved in behavioral and emotional responses, including those critical to survival) is probably quite different from H. sapiens's. Whatever cataclysm caused the collapse of this society left a remnant of humanity (or of Brits, to be specific) that's but a shade of what humans used to be, unable (and even unwilling) to defend themselves against the Morlocks, who are now able to return to the surface.\n\n#### Possible Avenues for Human Speciation\n- Many biologists and futurists seem to believe that there are two major avenues by which humans could possible speciate. **[[Transhumanism]]** is the ==philosophical movement of human transcendence through technological enhancement such as but not limited to the use of cybernetics.== \n  - This is a common trope in cyberpunk fiction, which include William Gibson's Neuromancer (1984) and the Ghost in the Shell properties as key examples. \n  - More modern technological breakthroughs have allowed the addition of genetic engineering methods as transhumanist innovations. \n    - Orphan Black's Neolution is a group that advocates all of these. \n  - The main advocacy in transhumanism is to ==better the lives of humans through enhancement==, such as replacing lost limbs with synthetic parts or fixing eyesight with cybernetic implants. \n  - But transhumanists are also beginning to advocate doing so even for ==purely cosmetic purposes==. \n    - It should be clear that speciation is not the main goal here, and in fact most of these tweaks on the human body aren't evolutionary and so cannot result in another species...unless the tweaking extends to the germ line, or those cells (i.e. gametes) that can pass on genetic changes to the offspring. \n      - CRISPR-Cas9 is an astounding technological breakthrough that allows edit parts of the human genome for potentially an insanely large amount of applications. If these changes are made in ==the germ line==, such changes coupled with reproductive isolation may result in speciation. \n- Speaking of reproductive isolation, it's much easier to imagine how an ==intergalactic diaspora or migration== would result in speciation. \n  - Imagine humans eventually colonizing other moons and planets in our galaxy or even outside it. The space between Earth and any of those moons or planets is the largest geographical barrier imaginable! \n  - And then each moon or planet will subject the colonists to unique evolutionary pressures that will favor particular adaptations over time. \n  - **Reproductive isolation** and **adaptations** are two key ingredients for speciation. \n  \n #### Points for Discussion\n1. Discuss human evolution and disease in the context of the Evolutionary Arms Race.\n2. What do you imagine will be a specific transhumanist trajectory that will result in the origination of new descendant species from Homo sapiens?\n3. What type of speciation will likely result from intergalactic diaspora?\n4. What do you think are other ways by which H. sapiens can give rise to a new species?\n5. How likely do you think The Time Machine's speculation of the future humans is?\n\n### Star Trek (\"The Chase\") - Image and Likeness\n- The Star Trek: The Next Generation episode \"The Chase\" unfolds in classic Star Trek fashion: ==science and exploration used as the scaffolding for philosophical inquiry.==\n- Narratively, \"The Chase\" is ==a science fiction take on the creation myth==: a story about a group of people that explains their history. And in the same way that science fiction about the future is really about the present, ==creation myths are stories we tell about the past to explain ourselves to ourselves in the present.== \n  - The story of Adam and Eve, for example, tells Christians that they have a God who loves them, but that they were disobedient and shunned that love. \n  - For the Greeks, the story of how the Olympian gods overthrew the Titans to become the reigning pantheon is a story about how the world is ruled by conflict and children rebelling against their parents. And so it goes, and so it goes.\n- Scientifically, the central novum of \"The Chase\"--the advanced precursor race that happens to look like many of the races in Star Trek--is a take on ==the idea of life arriving on our planet through being seeded== (a.k.a. panspermia). \n  - The idea that we might have been created by a higher power together with all other life on Earth is not new--see: religion--but \"The Chase\" hyperbolizes this, exploring the notion that ==we might even share a common creator with aliens from other worlds.== \n\nSo, game--let's look at what's going on here. Respond to any of the following questions!\n1. From a storytelling perspective, why do you think the program had to be encoded in DNA? What does this do for the ideas the story is trying to forward?\n2. What assumptions did the precursors have about the life that would come after them? Based on the actions of the various characters and factions in the episode, do you think they were right?\n3. Professor Galen says the discovery he's working on will shake galactic civilization to its core. Let's say this knowledge becomes widespread in the Star Trek universe. What do you think will happen? (You don't need to invoke any extra Star Trek knowledge beyond what's in this episode, but Trekkies, if you'd like to geek out, you absolutely can.)\n\n### Sense8 - Mutants and Mindlinks\n- While the psychic/empathic abilities possessed by sensates would seem to lump them in a category together with 99%[citation needed] of science fiction enhanced humans, Sense8 limits and nuances its specific version of an otherwise-well-worn novum in a really interesting way, making the sensate power set and narrative a very specific one: these aren't mind readers, coercives, or brainwashers, just otherwise-normal people ==capable of communicating with each other and borrowing skills from each other.==\n- In terms of affecting the outside world, nothing any sensate does is in any way superhuman, but in terms of their inner lives, ==the sensate experience is infinitely more complex than our own==, and this is something reflected in how the series is put together.\n- Sense8 is a science fiction property that employs something called the **mutant metaphor**: the trope of people born with ==extraordinary powers== being used as a metaphor for ==real-world conditions of marginalization and oppression.== \n  - We'll look at the most iconic example, the X-Men, later in the semester, but Sense8's shadowy sensate-hunting organization neatly fills the role of persecutor in this show, particularly in the second season. \n  - With texts like this, especially with a diverse ensemble cast, it's worth looking at the ways in which the ==mutation functions as both source of power and site of oppression==--the way the sensate connection allows Whispers to track Will, for example, but also allows Will to receive support from his cluster.\n- Beyond that, though, it's also necessary to examine the sensate mindlink itelf as the central novum of the text. We know it's a superpower, and often we tend to kind of gloss over superpowers as literary devices (especially in our superhero-saturated world where everyone's got a power), but the sensate ability is both very specific and much more ==semiotically rich== than, say, the ability to shoot heat beams from your eyes. \n  - Consider both Marvel's Luke Cage and Heroes' D. L. Hawkins, both Black men and ex-convicts--victims of the highly racialized criminal justice system in the United States--whose superpowers (invulnerability and intangibility, respectively) make them Black men who cannot be shot, a powerful image in a world where so many young Black men die in exactly that way. \n  - Or look at Jessica Cruz, DC's first human female Green Lantern, seemingly a walking paradox in that she wields a ring powered by willpower but is afraid to leave the house--her whole deal is that she's traumatized and agoraphobic, so unlike the former soldiers and cocky test pilots who are her senior Lanterns, to her, even leaving her apartment proves to her ring that she can \"overcome great fear.\"\n- Sense8 then is a wonderful text for examining identity, power, and the intersections of the two, ==the ways in which the site of our suffering can also be what saves us==--whether it's how we look, who we love, or what superpowers we wield--and how even superhuman abilities can be fertile ground for discourse and critical exploration.\n\nSo! Discussion questions; as usual, answer any or all.\n1. If the novum of the sensate superpower uses telepathy and mind-linking as the signifier, what exactly is being signified? What concept or capability is being heightened and hyperbolized to create the sensate experience?\n2. Do you have a favorite sensate? If so, fanboy/fangirl/fanperson over them for a bit. (Mark spoilers if you've seen episodes other than the one we've given you. But also help us convince your classmates to watch this show.)\n3. If sensates were real, would you want to be one? Why or why not? (Assume no shadowy sensate-hunting organization exists.)\n4. Discuss the potential of sensates for speciation.\n\n### The Time Machine - The End of Humanity\n- If Sense8 concerns itself with a fictional subspecies of humanity that might be living alongside us in the present, and Star Trek concerns itself with humanity's ancestry--our ultimate past--then The Time Machine, perhaps unsurprisingly, concerns itself with our future: the question of where we're going. \n  - This is very much the stuff of classic science fiction, but we're saving it for last in this module for two reasons: one, it's our first novel, so we figured you might want more time to read it, and two, we wanted to make a point: ==all this stuff is contextual.== ==The future in science fiction, along with the past, remains very much rooted in the present.==\n- **Class-based human speciation:** Wells' novel posits that in the year 802,701 A.D., humanity will have split into two different species: the Eloi, the lethargic and childlike above-ground species which the Time Traveler believes to be the descendents of the bourgeoisie upper class, and the Morlocks, the apelike, cave-dwelling creatures that the Time Traveler thinks evolved from the working class. Through the Time Traveler's interactions with both species, he reflects on what might have caused the divide, and on what characteristics from humanity might have remained within each of the descendent species.\n- This is, then, a text in which ==point of view matters a lot.==  \n  - At first glance, the Eloi seem far more sympathetic: they look like us, they wear clothes, they are coded as victims, and so on. \n  - The Morlocks, conversely, look inhuman, move at night, hunt and eat the creatures that look like us--our brain sees them and thinks, \"Monsters!\" \n  - But while the Time Traveler never really leaves that perspective, the text gives us enough hints and evidence for us to ask whether the Eloi truly are the more \"human\" of the two species, and whether the Morlocks might in fact be as human if not more than they are. And once we cross that line, our reading of the Eloi-Morlock dynamic can get a lot more interesting.\n- It's interesting that the text is so explicitly class-based and Marxist in its analysis of what might happen to humanity 800,000 years in the future. \n  - One belief of [[Marxism]] is the idea that [[History is dialectic]], ==driven by class struggle towards the ultimate end of a classless society.== \n  - On the one hand, if we believe the Time Traveler's theory about where the Eloi and Morlocks came from, then class struggle clearly remains even that far in the future, albeit hyperbolized into species war. (Plus, when he goes even further into the future, he sees that version of Earth where the sun is red and everything is crabs, so, hey, classless society!) \n  - But on the other hand, if that's our takeaway, then damn is this a pessimistic future: one in which class conflict runs so deep that it cleaves us into separate species and keeps going, so unlike the utopian future envisioned by Star Trek and texts like it.\n- Evolution is messy and wondrous, and often when we think of human evolution, we imagine where we as a species might go together. But texts like The Time Machine remind us that all our theorizing is ultimately rooted in who we are now, and if we don't account for and address the divides between us, they're not going to stop being there just because we've started dreaming of tomorrow.\n\nBut for now, let's do some reading. Feel free to answer any or all!\n1. How are the Eloi and the Morlocks coded in relation to each other? How does this shape our perceptions of them and the kinds of people they represent?\n2. How is the conflict between the Eloi and the Morlocks rendered? What statements is the text making using this conflict? (And do you agree?)\n3. Could there be an alternative explanation for where the Eloi and/or the Morlocks came from? If so, how would that change your reading of their interactions?\n4. Fan-fiction time! Make up your own story on how Homo sapiens speciated into the Eloi and the Morlocks. What were the major evolutionary forces that led to this split? Bonus question: do you think there are remnants of the original H. sapiens species somewhere in this future world?\n\n### Crimes of the Future - Surgery Is The New Sex\n- This David Cronenberg film depicts a borderline post-apocalyptic future defined by an intriguing central novum whose very premise seems to be rooted in evolution: at some point, ==the humans of the film's setting stopped feeling pain or getting infected with illness.== \n  - If you think this sounds too good to be true, you'd be right--this radical shift in the human condition has led to society (or at least the snippet of society that the film shows us) becoming stricken with a fundamental, fatalistic ennui. Without pain, humankind seems trapped in a self-destructive search for pleasure, often resorting to bodily mutilation in an attempt to feel anything at all.\n- In addition to being post-apocalyptic, the world of Crimes of the Future is incredibly dystopian, in the truest sense of the word. \n  - While in general the term **\"dystopia\"** usually refers to an imagined society which contradicts the author's ethos, often characterized by fear, oppression, and propaganda, some scholars define a specific type of dystopia--the _[[Anti-utopia]]--as something which specifically critiques the concept of utopia. \n  - It's the sort of thinking that leads to the notion of the monkey's paw: ==if we believe that nothing good comes without a commensurate cost, then it follows that the cost of a perfect society must be high indeed, and an anti-utopian dystopia is what happens when the cost is too high.==\n- It's worth pointing out that the \"perfection\" in Crimes of the Future--the absence of pain and infectious disease--doesn't seem to be deliberate on the part of humankind, but rather it's described as ==something that \"happened.\"== The worldbuilding seems to imply that it's the ==product of evolution==, but the text doesn't focus too hard on the history of this novum, opting instead to pay attention to the people and societies it creates.\n  - People are changing in Crimes of the Future, and one of the other nova in the text literalizes that idea even further: people's bodies seem to be developing new structures and processes, many of whose functions are unknown.\n- As a work of social science fiction, the film presents us a society shaped by a particular biological shift in humankind, but suggests pretty heavily that ==that shift itself may be a response to the world humanity created==, the species changing in accordance with the increasingly decadent, derelict world it's constructed for itself, a sort of perverted Red Queen world where we are perpetually adapting to ourselves in a masturbatory, almost cancerous inward spiral. \n  - And by the journey's end, even as some of the mysteries that drive the plot are solved, we're left with more questions about this world than answers--and, like mutations or the search for pleasure or the strange recursive links between biology and society, many of these questions may never fully resolve themselves.\n\nDiscussion time! You know the drill.\n1. Why is the mutation of the boy from the beginning of the movie significant?\n2. Why are the government and the evolutionists at odds? What does this conflict represent in context of the setting?\n3. This film is horny as shit.

It involves developing core psychological resources and becoming aware of how you think, behave, and feel. When you are mentally fit, you lean into challenges and feel able to navigate change and stress, no matter what day-to-day life presents. Mental fitness enables you to reconnect with what it is that you love in your work and your life.\n\u003e Mental fitness is more than the absence of mental illness. It‚Äôs beyond self-care and recovery. It's about growth and thinking, feeling, and performing at your best in all areas of your life. Mental fitness is developed by equipping people to treat¬†[mental health as something that they can strengthen and improve](https://www.betterup.com/en-us/resources/blog/prince-harry-chief-impact-officer?hsLang=en).\n\u003e When you‚Äôre physically not well, you know it ‚Äî the symptoms come on and you know it‚Äôs time to get some sleep (and a cup of tea). When you‚Äôre¬†[experiencing anxiety, depression, or a sense of languish](https://www.betterup.com/en-us/resources/blog/not-ill-not-well-massive-middle?hsLang=en), you don‚Äôt always know it.\n\u003e When it comes to our physical health, many of us aspire for more than just to get back to ‚Äúfine‚Äù ‚Äî that is, the absence of undesirable symptoms. We know that, ==even if we're not ill, we can increase our fitness and health to achieve a goal or level of performance.== Our physical fitness can be integral to our desired way of life.¬†\n\u003e The same can be true of our mental health.¬†[Fine is just fine ‚Äî it‚Äôs not thriving](https://www.betterup.com/en-us/resources/blog/why-fine-is-good-but-not-good-enough?hsLang=en). And that‚Äôs not good enough. With our mental health, we don‚Äôt even know the upper bounds of how fit we can become. ==Mental fitness embraces the idea that individuals can develop a positive mental state that exceeds ‚Äúfine.‚Äù==\n\n\u003e Mental fitness, though, means much more than living without pain or disability. It is about building strength and improving your well-being. Someone who doesn‚Äôt have an ailment may still not be at the level of fitness that they want to be at, and that may impede their goals. Put another way, just because you‚Äôre not ill¬†[doesn‚Äôt mean you can climb Mount Kilimanjaro](https://www.betterup.com/en-us/resources/blog/the-most-valuable-lesson-i-learned-climbing-mount-kilimanjaro?hsLang=en).\n\n\u003e Changing our focus from mental health to mental fitness means asking people about what ‚Äî and how ‚Äî they want to be. What are you training your mind for ‚Äî that is, what is your mountain?¬†[The conversation starts with a new definition of mental health](https://www.betterup.com/en-us/resources/blog/why-mental-fitness-is-of-strategic-importance?hsLang=en)¬†that embraces the idea that people can be more or less mentally fit. Everyone‚Äôs needs and journey to mental strength and fitness is unique. But with support, everyone can be the best, healthiest version of themselves.\n\n\u003e Our brains carry thoughts along neural pathways. These pathways are like ruts that we create and reinforce over time. You can think of these as your brain‚Äôs ‚Äúhabits.‚Äù When we repeat a thought pattern many times, that neural pathway gets reinforced. This makes it more likely that you will repeat the pattern in the future.\n\u003e Sometimes, these thought patterns can make us react in ways that aren't helpful. Instead of reacting to the current situation, we take well-worn pathways to past behaviors. It‚Äôs as if you were taking your usual route to work, taking the same exit on autopilot ‚Äî even when you meant to stop somewhere else.\n\u003e As you build mental fitness, you'll have the awareness, strength, and agility to identify options. You can choose another route instead of responding automatically. Improving your mental fitness is good for your brain‚Äôs¬†[neuroplasticity, which benefits our emotions and memory](https://www.betterup.com/en-us/resources/learning-to-doing-to-being?hsLang=en).\n\u003e Automatic thinking comes from our survival brain, the limbic system. It is constantly scanning the environment for threats and has been throughout evolution. We inherited the limbic system from chimps and it can protect us. But, left unchecked, it can give rise to thoughts and actions that don‚Äôt align with our values and our goals.\n\u003e The good news is that we can reprogram our brains. With the same kind of practice that we use to build muscle, we can create neural pathways that better serve us.\n\n**Emotional push-ups**\n\n\u003e One possible solution, says clinical psychologist¬†[Emily Anhalt](https://www.dremilyanhalt.com/), is to add an ‚Äúemotional workout‚Äù to your self-care regimen. ‚ÄúJust like working out prevents high blood pressure and heart disease, emotional fitness can be a proactive stance toward stress management,‚Äù says Anhalt, the co-founder of¬†[Coa,](https://www.joincoa.com/)¬†a gym for mental health.\n\u003e In Coa‚Äôs virtual classes, Anhalt and her team teach exercises called ‚Äúemotional push-ups,‚Äù which are small ways to work on yourself each day. ‚ÄúThe purpose is to strengthen your mental health muscles so that you‚Äôre in a better position to face life‚Äôs challenges,‚Äù she says.\n\n\u003e Being interviewed recently, Dr Anhalt defined Emotional Fitness as ‚Äòthe ongoing proactive practice of strengthening your mental and emotional health, helping build the tools we need to face and move through the inevitable ups and downs of life‚Äô. The ambition cited was ‚Äòto make working on your mental health as accessible and proactive a practice as working on your physical fitness‚Äô and one example used was that of ‚Äòemotional push-ups‚Äô\n\u003e _A regular push up is a small physical exertion that puts you a little bit outside of your comfort zone - it helps you grow and when you do them often not only will you be able to do more push-ups you‚Äôll also be able to do more of other things, as well as preventing (physical) issues down the line. The emotional equivalent is ==putting ourselves a little bit outside of our emotional comfort zone so that we can grow and do more emotional work and also prevent mental health issues later.==\n\u003e _\n\nThree tips:\n- Build resilience with a self-esteem file\n- Increase productivity by scheduling a worry hour\n\u003e These include striking up conversations with strangers, saying thank you, or accepting compliments without deflection.\n\n**Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria**\n\u003e Instead of relying on avoidance or the negative expectancy that fuels¬†[anxiety](https://www.additudemag.com/slideshows/do-i-have-anxiety-treatment-types/), understand that your responses to rejection follow a pattern. Your goal is to create new patterns of responding, thinking and behaving to reduce both the perceptions of rejection and the reactions when it actually occurs.\n\n##### Outline\n###### Draft 1\n1.

Aspire not just to be emotionally fine, but to be emotionally fit\n\n##### Draft/Final\n###### ChatGPT template\nRejection is a difficult emotion to grapple with, but it is something that we all face at one point or another in our lives. From job rejections to romantic breakups, the sting of being rejected can leave us feeling helpless and unsure of ourselves. However, with a bit of work and dedication, it is possible to become more resilient against rejection and build up your emotional fitness.\n\nEmotional fitness refers to a person's ability to manage and regulate their emotions in a healthy and constructive way. It involves developing skills such as self-awareness, mindfulness, and resilience, which can help us deal with the ups and downs of life. Emotional fitness is important because it allows us to be more in control of our emotions, and not be overwhelmed by them.\n\nSo, how does emotional fitness work? It involves actively working on our emotional health, just as we would work on our physical health. One way to do this is through what I call \"emotional push-ups\". Just as physical push-ups help to build strength and endurance, emotional push-ups help to build emotional strength and endurance. This involves intentionally practicing skills that will help you become more emotionally fit.\n\nHere are some strategies that you can use to help develop self-awareness, mindfulness, and resilience:\n\nSelf-awareness: One way to develop self-awareness is through self-reflection. This can be done through journaling, which allows you to examine your thoughts and feelings in a structured way. Another way to develop self-awareness is by relying on external support, such as family, friends, counselors, or therapists, who can provide you with feedback and insights about your emotional state.\n\nMindfulness: One way to develop mindfulness is by starting a yoga or meditation practice. These practices help you to become more aware of your thoughts and feelings, and to cultivate a sense of calm and clarity. Another way to develop mindfulness is by writing a gratitude list daily. This helps to shift your focus away from negative thoughts and toward positive aspects of your life.\n\nResilience: One way to develop resilience is by creating a file of your past successes and praises, which you can refer to during tough times. This helps to remind you of your strengths and capabilities, and can give you a boost of confidence when you need it most. Another way to develop resilience is by talking back to your harsh inner critic. This involves challenging negative self-talk and replacing it with more positive and affirming thoughts.\n\nIn summary, the key to becoming resilient against rejection is to actively work on your emotional fitness. Instead of trying to avoid rejection (which is impossible), become capable enough to face it head-on. Aspire not just to be emotionally fine, but to be emotionally fit. By practicing emotional push-ups and developing skills such as self-awareness, mindfulness, and resilience, you can become more in control of your emotions and better equipped to deal with life's challenges.\n\n###### Writing\nRejection is an ineradicable part of our lives. While it is already a difficult emotion to grapple with, some struggle with it more than others ‚Äî particularly those with Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder (ADHD). One of the most understated symptoms of ADHD is emotional dysregulation, which can manifest as rejection sensitive dysphoria (RSD): extreme emotional sensitivity and pain triggered by perceived or actual rejection, teasing, or criticism (Dodson, 2022 \u0026 2023).  What distinguishes RSD from normal emotional responses is this unbearable intensity; it is often experienced as a \"physical\" wound, making the afflicted feel like they were stabbed in the chest. When internalized, RSD leads people to subject themself to negative thought spirals; when externalized, it causes people to explode at  whatever is responsible for their pain. To avoid this unpleasant emotional response, people cope in a variety of unhealthy ways: people-pleasing, giving up on trying, and overachieving. While these defense mechanisms can initially help with relieving internal stress, sole reliance on them prevents people from feeling their emotions, hindering their ability to process them. This enables the fear of rejection to overwhelm their minds, preventing people from making the most out of their lives. \n\nThey key to overcoming RSD is growing thick skin; this can be developed by maintaining emotional fitness: \"an ongoing, proactive practice that increases self-awareness, positively affects relationships...and prevents mental and emotional health struggles down the line\" (Anhalt, n.d.). Ryan Howes, Ph.D (n.d.), defines thick skin is ‚Äúthe ability to adapt and roll with changes and challenges common to life, as well as the ability to bounce back from particularly difficult times.‚Äù; consequently, those who have thin skin (whether it's because of trauma or growing up sheltered) will end up experiencing all of life's hazards with excruciating precision. Thus, emotional fitness is important because it serves as preventative care. Instead of getting stuck in the endless cycle of reacting to and healing from emotional pain, the emotionally fit have the strength to take on life's challenges, making them less vulnerable to getting hurt by them.\n\nWhat makes emotional fitness possible is neuroplasticity: the brain‚Äôs ability to change in response to new experiences and information. It does this by carrying thoughts along neural pathways, which are created and reinforced over time. These pathways act as habits; frequently occuring thought patterns reinforce the involved neural pathway, which in turns increases the likelihood of repeating that pattern (Cooks-Campbell, 2021).  The brain's neuroplasticity can work can work for us or against us. Traumatic experiences like rejection can make the brain develop and default to maladaptive pathways like rumination; conversely, the brain can also rewire itself to overcome such traumatic experiences (Schweig, 2022). \n\nBetter neural pathways can be built through \"emotional push-ups\": small  emotional exertions that puts one a little bit outside of their emotional comfort zone (Anhalt, 2022). The more push-ups one does, the more they grow outside of their comfort zone; this allows  them to do heavier emotional work (e.g. processing rejection) and protect them from mental health issues in the future. Listed below is a list of exercises you can do to develop self-awareness, practice mindfulness, and build resilience (Anhalt, n.d.):\n\n1. **Reflect on yourself through journalling.**\n\t1. If your mind often gets too loud, journalling can help clear out your brain. When you're unloading all your problems and worries onto the page, you're able to slow down and work through your thoughts and feelings.\n\t3. Looking back on previous entries can help you notice thought patterns in your life. After this, you can determine what's keeping you in those patterns. Then, you can break these loops by coming up with solutions.\n\t4. attitude of gratitude... deemphasize negative thoughts\n2. **Take up a yoga or meditation practice.** \n\t1. Through guided breathing and held poses, both yoga and meditation require getting comfortable with the uncomfortable ‚Äî  which is what mindfulness is all about.\n\t2. A greater understanding of your relationship with discomfort gives you more power to change your reaction towards it.\n\t3. So instead of automatically moving away from discomfort, try to sit with it for a while and show yourself that you can handle it. Silence doesn't always have to be broken; issues don't always have to be fixed immediately; difficult conversations don't always have to be avoided.\n\t4. Remember: You do not need to break every silence, fix every issue immediately or avoid difficult conversations.\n3. **Shut down your harsh inner critic.**\n\t1. You can support this healthy self by reminding yourself of your past wins, along with listening to positive affirmations.\n\n\nOverall, instead of trying to avoid rejection (a futile task), become thick-skinned enough to tackle it. This capacity can be built through doing small exercises that challenge you emotionally; over time, these will turn into habits that help you adapt to difficult times. The main lesson you should take away from this column: never stop growing. Continue doing the recommended exercises even if you feel \"fine\", because why settle for fine when you can be thriving (Eatough, 2021)? Emotional fitness is all about constantly striving to be the best version of ourselves; so aspire to be not just emotionally fine, but also emotionally fit.\n\n\n\nMaintaining emotional fitness helps you not only reframe your approach to rejection, but also advocate for a better perception of emotional health. \nIn order to address an emotional problem like RSD, it must first be understood.\nGood emotional health isn't just determined by a lack of pain; one could still be emotionally sensitive or thinking unhealthily. \n\n###### Sources \n- ADHD, RSD\n\t- https://www.additudemag.com/rejection-sensitive-dysphoria-and-adhd/\n\t- https://www.additudemag.com/rejection-sensitive-dysphoria-adhd-emotional-dysregulation/\n- https://psychcentral.com/blog/5-tips-to-develop-thicker-skin#1\n- https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/7-habits-developing-emotional-fitness-mark-conlan/?trk=pulse-article_more-articles_related-content-card\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T15:56:57.00413649Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2023-02-19":{"title":"2023-02-19","content":"## Contemporary Issues: Psychology and Personal Growth\n#psychology #personaldevelopment #sociology #business \n### Module 3.1: Social Capital as Brokerage and Closure\n#### Lecture\n**[Brokerage and Culture: The Importance of Social Capital](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMEz_Ou88Oo)**\n- [[Social capital]] really is about the ==connections== that you make with other people and how that ==benefits== you\n\t- Thinking of it like capital...look at your relationships as personal ==investments==\n- Self-help isn't just about the self. It's about the relationships that we have , and how these relationships benefit us. That is [[Social capital]]\n- What do you get from your social networks?\n\t- You may say support, love, affection\n\t- But more importantly, we also get ==opportunities== and ==information==\n\n##### Brokerage\n- **Brokers:** people who are part of at least two distinct networks, connecting people from these to each other\n\t- Similar to real estate\n- A network indicates the distribution of information, which we define as an advantage: if you have more information, you are at a better position.\n\t- ![[images/Social Capital Expansion.png]]\n\t- **Closed networks:** consisted of people who all know each other well \n\t\t- When you're part of a closed network, it means that ==you're working off the same information.== You don't have an advantage for having any more information because the information that you get is similar to what everyone already knows.\n\t- But if you try to be a broker, making a deliberate effort to be a connective tissue across different networks...\n\t\t- You get a new network while still keeping your original network\n\t\t- You have information breadth, timing\n\t\t- You arbritage. You're brokering, bringing together, innovating\n\t- Similar to the concept of [[Weak ties]]?\n- [[Create value by bridging structural holes]]. Here are some specific terms and their definitions:\n\t- **Sticky information:** information expensive to move because: (a) tacit, (b) complex, (c) requires other knowledge to absorb, or (d) interaction with sender, recepient, or channel\n\t- **Structural hole:** disconnection between two groups/clusters of people\n\t- **Bridge:** relation across structural hole\n\t- **Network entrepreneur:** a person who bridges across a structural hole. Also known as \"broker\" or \"connector\" \n\t- **[[Brokerage]]:** act of coordinating across a structural hole\n- [[Business success decreases as the network around a person closes]]\n\t- ![[images/Business Network Constraints.png]]\n\t- Those who connect many structural holes, they have a higher performance. Those who have fewer structural holes, those who are more in close networks, their relative performance is actually less.\n- Takeaway: be part of different groups, so that you can get different information. Then, use this information to innovate, to create new ideas.\n\t- You don't have to disperse yourself too much. Just be open to different connections.\n\t- But remember that it's also important to settle in a group, to have your own expertise\n- How [[Brokerage]] works: ===Creativity and innovation=== are at the heart of it\n\t- ![[images/Brokerage, Creativity, and Innovation.png]]\n\t- If you're brokering relationships, you get to see alternative perspectives. You get to see best practices, and adapt them to your own contexts.\n- Summary points\n\t- **[[Network structure is a proxy for the distribution of information]]**\n\t\t- For reasons of opportunity, shared interests, experience ‚Äî simple inertia ‚Äî organizations and markets drift towards the bridge-and-cluster structure known as a ==\"small world\"==\n\t- Rules of [[Social capital]]:\n\t\t- **[[Brokers do better]]**\n\t\t\t- Bridge relations across the structural holes between clusters provide information breadth, timing, and arbritage advantages, such that network brokers managing the bridges are at higher risk of \"productive accident\" in detecting and developing good ideas.\n\t\t\t- By clearing the sticky-information market across organizations, brokers tend to be recognized leaders. They are better compensated, more widely celebrated, and more quickly promoted than their peers. Some specifics:\n\t\t\t\t- Close networks do not identify unintelligent managers so much as expert specialists.\n\t\t\t\t- Creativity \u0026 innovation is an ==import/export process.== Value is not at the innovation source. It emerges each time productive new knowledge is adopted in a target audience.\n\t\t\t\t- Creativity \u0026 innovation depend on the network as well as the inventive person. It does not depend on individual genius so much as it depends on employees finding opportunities to broker knowledge from where it is routine to where it would create value.\n\t\t- **[[Contingent returns to brokerage]]**\n\t\t\t- To the extent that the broker is creating something new, there is no guarantee that the proposal will work in our market, with our company processes, staffed by our people. There is risk to accepting the proposal. \n\t\t\t- Chains of command broken in service of company interests can just as easily be broken in service of personal interests, or in service of well-intentioned but strategy-eroding interests. \n\t\t\t- Social standing in the form of job rank, network status, or reputation is the way would-be brokers overcome the suspicions with which brokers can be viewed. \n\t\t\t- Reputation is particularly valuable. It legitimates the largest number of people to be successful brokers.\n\n##### Closure\n- **[[Closed networks facilitate trust and shared beliefs by creating and maintaining reputations]]**\n\t- ![[images/Closed networks and reputations.png]]\n- **[[Closure creates \"bandwidth\"]]: more channels of communication allow more accurate and rapid communication, so poor behavior is more readily detected and managed.**\n\t- **[[Closure]]:** the lack of structural holes within a network\n\t- ![[images/Closure creates bandwidth.png]]\n\t- Closure can also be very good because it increases your ==trust==\n- **Bottom-line performance advantage of closed networks: [[Reputation mechanism generates trust and efficiency**]]\n\t- By creating a wide bandwidth for information flow, closure enhances communication and personal visibility within a group...\n\t\t- which creates reputation costs for individuals who express opinion or behavior inconsistent with group standards,\n\t\t- which makes in-group behavior less likely, so trust is less risky,\n\t\t- which enhances productivity as people become self-aligning in extraordinary efforts to preserve their reputation (lowering costs for labor, monitoring, quality, and speed)\n\t- Reputation is the mechanism by which [[Closure]] has its effect. [[Closure]] delivers value by creating a reputation cost for deviation from cooperative, extraordinary effort. In other words, ==closure grows the bottom line. == \n\t- Closure is often associated with successful efficiency programs (e.g. SixSigma)\n- Closure is essential to reputation. Positive and negative reputations quickly stabilize. What implications does this have for building reputation?\n- Summary points\n\t- Rule of [[Social capital]]: **Reputations emerge from gossip in close networks, which generates a sense of community and efficiency as a by-product**.\n\t\t- Network closure enhances communication and visibility within a group,\n\t\t\t- (a) which creates reputation costs for individuals who express opinion or behavior inconsistent with group standards, \n\t\t\t- (b) which increases the probability of trust and cooperation within the group, \n\t\t\t- (c) which enhances productivity as people become self-aligning in extraordinary efforts.\n\t\t- Higher productivity comes from lower costs for labor, management, and time. Closure delivers value by creating a reputation cost for deviation from shared colleague opinion and practice. \n\t- CAUTION: **The reputation mechanism by which closure delivers value can have a side-effect of groupthink, a passive \"waiting for orders\", and so value destruction**.\n\t\t- When information moves unaffected through a network (e.g. eBay), closure creates wide bandwidth, facilitating trust and efficiency.\n\t\t- However, social networks usually involve an ==etiquette filter.== The more polite the people, the more etiquette affects what is shared, so ==closure produces echo, not bandwidth.==\n\t\t- The information that defines reputation is selected for empathy between gossipers, not accuracy about the person/object being discussed. The result is ==ignorant certainty== and you no longer own your reputation -- your reputation is owned by the people who gossip about you.\n\t\t- Therefore, there are three key players in reputation development: you, your contact, and the contact's colleague.\n\t\t- Build by focusing on projects colleagues will want to discuss. Allowed to develop unchecked, the ignorant certainty fostered by closed-network echo can become rigid stereotypes about people and practices outside the group (with predictable problems for the realized value of diversity), and people withdraw into Milgram's agentic state, waiting for orders.\n- Overall, you need both [[Brokerage]] and [[Closure]]\n\t- ![[images/Advantage and Pathology in the Enterprise Network.png]]\n#### Reading\n\n#### Strength of Weak Ties\n**[Social Networks and Getting a Job: Mark Granovetter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3bBajcR5fE)**\n\n\n\n#### Social Map\n##### Instructions\nNow that you know the importance of social capital--that is, your social connections, networks, and your strong and weak ties--**create a sociogram or social map.**¬†\n-   You can draw your social map of strong and weak ties (have at least 20 connections there).\n    -   Take a photo of it, put it in a document.\n    -   In the same document, answer these questions in a paragraph form:\n        -   Am I a broker or am I part of a closed network?¬†\n        -   How many \"groups\" or \"clusters\" of people do I broker?\n        -   What have been the benefits of belonging to different clusters?

This is the key question that will drive our discourse.\n### The knight in shining armor\n- This 3rd character in the medieval era is the knight. With the many hollywood blockbusters and Netflix series that have been created about Kings, queens, knights, warlocks and the like, many visuals probably easily come to mind...but what was the backdrop of these fairytale-like adventures? The quick answer is: ==the feudal system.== \n- Watch this [short video about feudalism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQq6OeiEfrg) to recall the context of what we will begin to label as Chivalric Education. As you watch the video about the feudal system,  think about these points:\n1. What is the essence of the feudal system?\n2. Does this social organization exist in current times?\n\n- In the Feudal System, chivalry brought forth an educational system particularly for the noble class - who, as you learned in the video above, was the lucky minority. -- Chivalric education then, was training for knighthood. The [next video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_N8Nt5q5Go) shows shows the training a squire has to undergo to become a knight.  \n\n- As compared to Monasticism and Scholasticism, Chivalric Education emphasized \"action\" (Remember in Greek Education - where the themes of man of wisdom and man of action first emerged?). \n- However, like in the past 2 types of education, the aim was still quite singular - ==a devotion to the service of the Knight's God - who in this case is his King and Queen.== \n- The aim therefore was mainly \"social discipline\" - in the two videos above, one of the clear descriptors of this age was how people were divided into classes in society - and for a person to live by the expectations of his/her class.\n\n\u003e Who was the educated man in Chivalric Education? How is the education man different/similar here? (vs. conceptions of the educated person influenced by monasticism/scholasticism)\n\n##### The craftsman and the masterpiece\n- In Chivalric Education, securing one's place in society was one of the main purposes of education. The context of which was feudalism and the rule of royalty and the landed. However, in the latter part of the middle ages, the [crusades](https://www.history.com/topics/middle-ages/crusades) happened, and this set up the context for this next form of education. \n- Because of the crusades, there was an increase of trade and commerce across countries, which ushered the growth of free cities (the downfall of feudalism) and the rise of the middle class, or the ==\"burgher\"==\n- Anyway, it was in this context that the Craftsman in the Guild System was developed, in pursuit of the \"masterpiece\".\n- Think about a masterpiece you've made before. What did school or your own education have to do with it? How has your education contributed to your ability to create that masterpiece? or if you think that it wasn't education that led to it, what did?\n- In the guild system, creating a masterpiece is necessary to ==reach the highest level of education.== Guilds are associations of people who share a common interest or do the same kind of work (If being part of a varsity team or an organization led you to a masterpiece, then you might have been part of a \"modern day guild\".  The emergence of the guilds necessitated a new kind of education that focuses on ==vocational training.==\n- Watch this video on [medieval guilds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnQlHeee9Dw).\n  - Overview of the guild system:\n    1. Parent brings a boy to a master\n    2. Parents pay the master to house and feed the boy\n    3. He is taken in as an apprentice\n    4. The young man trains for nine years\n    5. The young man becomes a journeyman\n    6. The young man receives wages\n    7. The guild approves his masterpiece\n    8. The young man opens his own shop  \n\n\u003e Is there something that you think we can take from this education system, that would improve how the current education system is? How so? \n\n### Rethinking the Educated Person\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23095578/220029030-571c5ce1-aaf0-4eb1-a483-fc3cd8bd8f43.png)\nIn this module, you learned about the 4 key characters of Medieval Education (The monk, the scholastic, the knight and the craftsman) - each one representing a particular view about the educated person that consequently shaped the aims, methods and content of education. As we put this module to a close, we go back to the key question we started with: Who is an educated person?\n\n1. To what extent does your conception of the educated person agree with or differ from the 4 perspectives of the educated person in Medieval Education?\n2. In these 4 types of education we explored, we saw how religion, society and economy influenced the type of education presented. Reflect on your conception of an educated person - what do you think has shaped your perspective?\n\n#### Answer\n##### Outline\n- My alignment with the four perspectives\n  -  My conception: an open-minded critical thinker.\n  -  Addition to this: who dedicates themself towards gaining expertise or enlightenement? a lifelong learner. this is the diffrentiator\n  -  Similarities\n    -  Explicit progression\n    -  Intention\n    -  Discipline\n  -  Difference\n    - Aims... less to do with the state or religion  \n- What external forces have shaped your perspective?\n  - values from surrounding environment and religion?\n  - Reading this module made me realize that I am a social being\n  - Before: being an introvert and philomath with ADHD, I used to think that a lot of my education was self-driven. If I had a particular interest (e.g. strength \u0026 conditioning; metacognition), I'd go out of my way to learn it\n  - But I realized that the people surrounding me not only motivate my education, but also facilitate it \n\n##### Writing\n\nFor me, the educated person is an open-minded critical thinker. Aside from this, they must also be a lifelong learner, constantly dedicating themselves to gaining more expertise or enlightenment. Looking at the four key characters of Medieval Education, I can definitely say that there is more agreement than disagreement. This is because of the underlying aim of security, which I believe all the 4 types of education share despite their differences. The monk and the scholastic pursued education in order to secure their faith; the former wanted to shed the unholiness of their predecessors, while the latter wanted to defend their beliefs against unbelievers. Even if the next two types became more secular in nature, this need for security still remained. The knight and the craftsman pursued education in order to secure their place in society; the former did this by working to become a valuable asset for the king/queen, while the latter did this by working to be seen as valuable by their fellow citizens. Overall, this need for security made discipline (whether physical or intellectual) a result of Medieval Education. I believe this trait is stil worth developing today (without the extreme methods employed by Medieval Education).\n\nReflecting on my conception of the educated person, I can definitely see how much my social network has influenced my perspective. Before, I saw my education was mainly self-driven, given that I'm an introvert with ADHD. Whenever I have a new hyperfixation (e.g. strength \u0026 conditioning, metacognition), I'd go out of my way to learn all about it: diving down internet rabbitholes, attending relevant talks and classes, and writing my own notes and essays. However, I realize now that no human is exempt from being a social creature, which has definitely influenced my education; I can't deny that it's people who mainly drive and sustain my learning. Even if I'm inherently passionate about my interests, it's my friends and idols that spark these passions inside of me. Even if I consider myself a philomath (a natural lover of learning), it's my peers and teachers that motivate me to continue learning. As a result, I now liken the educated person to a patchwork quilt; they are a \"masterpiece\" made up of their learning influences.\n\n#### Summary of Module 2\n1. **THE EDUCATED MAN:** One of the main themes we explored in this module is the educated person, and as you saw, there were 4 different perspectives presented. As educators in the future, your own conception of the educated person will affect your views about teaching and learning. At the same time, the institutions you will be teaching in will also have their own perceptions of the educated person - it would be good to see if your paradigm matches with theirs.\n**2. RELIGION, SOCIETY and ECONOMY:** Another set of themes that emerged here were the external influences of education - religion, society and economy. When you think about it, education today is still influenced by these forces. What other forces do you think continues to flavor the aims and type of education? Think about schools like Ateneo - what is the bias of institutions like ours?\n\n \n","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T15:56:57.00413649Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2023-02-21":{"title":"2023-02-21","content":"## Contemporary Issues: Psychology and Personal Growth\n\n#psychology #personaldevelopment \n### Intimacy, Sex, (In)fidelity\n#### Sex, Power, Assault\n- In this sub-module, we will be talking about something \"taboo.\" Nonetheless, it is an important topic: sex.\n- We start with a discussion of the book **Sexual Citizens: A Landmark Study of Sex, Power, and Assault on Campus** by Jennifer Hirsch and Shamus Khan. It's an immensely powerful book that offers counter-intuitive ideas on thinking about assault, sexual \"projects\", sexual locations, and thinking of how sex figures into a good life.\n- The book is almost 400 pages long. Would you want to read the book for three days, or would you want to watch an hour-long video about it? Even if it's still quite long, I think the one hour you spend with this video will be worth it. :)\n\n**[Jennifer S. Hirsch and Shamus Khan | Sexual Citizens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYYWyEqJjlk)**\n\u003e Over five years, professors Jennifer Hirsch and Shamus Khan interviewed more than 150 Columbia and Barnard College undergrads about their sex lives. The research explored what students wanted out of sex, how troubling encounters unfolded and how layers of misunderstandings led to assault. This is the book to read to help lead conversations about sex. It reframes the dialogue and helps prepare young people for sexual relationships. Read it, share it. Empower the young folks in your life.\n- It's not about adjudication; it's about prevention\n- One of the strongest predictors for being assaulted in college was being assaulted in high school\n- One of the reasons why assaults happen: the silence and shame that exists around sex and sexuality\n  - People lose their voice when they find themselves in situations they don't want to be in...rights aren't talked about  \n  - This is why it's important to have parents who talk about sex...it allows their kids to trust them with related topics. Otherwise, their values will be formed by pornography and advertising\n- Beds have meanings...they're laden\n- It's not just furniture that influences campus life, but also control over space -- which is really important for explaining power imbalances.\n- Most girls are conditioned largely by society or their parents to see sex as an ==emotional currency==. Meanwhile, for most boys, it was the opposite; they were conditioned to see sex as a ==physical currency==.\n  - Hybridizing these perspectives would create a healthier viewpoint of sex in general\n- \"You up?\" has a lot of meanings\n- Asking \"Was this consensual or not?\" is really fundamentally a question about ==adjudication==, that is, who can we hold responsible for what happened, and what would a reasonable person do within this kind of context.\n- Alternative viewpoint: seeing consent processes as things that were not just a negotiation between two people in a moment, but instead that had ==entire social worlds== that were brought in that moment\n  - E.G. friends helping each other interpret the aftermath of sex, hooking up friends with other friends\n  - ^ All these relationships influence the sexual experience\n- What we say doesn't always align with what we think, especially in terms of consent\n  - People have consented sex without verbally saying anything, and people who verbally consent participate in sex that they don't desire\n- Push away from the idea of sex as as a contract. Part of the idea of sexual citizenship is asking how you're treating the other person.\n  - Are you treating them like someone who said yes, or treating them like a human being who was forced to say yes? \n- On people choosing to do sexual acts just to complete the encounter... these are failures of sexual citizenship \n  - Men: not asking what the person really wanted\n  - Women: raised in such a way that they think this is how they should be acting sexually \n- The heterosexual students have a clear script that they learn (from media) for how sex should go forward. Meanwhile, the LGBTQ students don't have this script. Findnigs: there were many queer students whose consent practices were actually exactly the way you would want consent to be like.\n  - On the one hand, queer consent practices seemed like they should be producing a lot of safety. But on the other hand, we know from our survey and from other surveys that their rates of assault are actually much higher.\n  - Perhaps because there is already so much shame surrounding gender identity. The kind of fear about the character of queer communities often produced additional warned of vulnerabilities for young people.\n- On the influence of alcohol: students don't just drink and then like mistakenly have sex. In fact, they do it on purpose -- they drink in order to have sex.\n- Race: you can't look atthe moment of consent without understanding sort of the broader dynamics of campus social life\n- Vision: prevention of sexual assault. Mission: breaking the silence on sex. How? Comprehensive sexuality education that is not just a course that's taught in school, but instead a kind of ==national project== that everyone participates in.\n  - Analogy: driving. We don't just give people the keys (which is what sex education is like, heavily focused on the body). Instead, we tell them how to drive safely. We also create environments (i.e. roads) and policies to make driving safer. \n  - Part of the prevention strategy is to ask ourselves like what would it look like to do sexuality education in the same way that we do driver's ed\n- A strategy against adjucation: a restorative justice model. Part of the ways in which we should think about adressing assaults after they happen is in reaffirming people's sexual citizenship\n  - There is a normative commitment (not just carceral)\n- Pornography  has such a large influence on young people because we've abdicated our responsibility to actually provide sexuality education in it.\n- Part of the idea here in in placing sex within a broader matrix of social relationships so in saying that like sex is a social behavior it's not a health behavior is that is to say that like there are lots of things that we can do in terms ofcreating the conditions of basic respectand recognition of other persons that have nothing to do with sex that could actually have big impacts on the ways in which people act sexually\n- Analytical tools (three main concepts):\n  - What is your sexual project?\n  - How can we build sexual citizenship?\n  - What are the power inequalities within space? (sexual geography)\n- making that learning (about sex) about critical thinking and power... is part of providing them with the ==tools== that they need to ==navigate these social worlds== more safely\n\n##### Reflection about Sex\n\u003e Without needing to go deep into your personal lives, what are your reflections about how these ideas might be relevant to your life? What is sex for you? What are your thoughts about hooking up? How do your friends talk about sex? What have you learned about sex? Where do you learn about sex?\n\nListening to the *Sexual Citizens* discussion made me realize how lucky I am to have my current group of friends. My *barkada* has been together since senior high school, where we were all brought together through *Dungeons \u0026 Dragons* ‚Äî a game that has kept us close-knit for so long. Because of this, we've witnessed each other's development over the years (e.g. discovering gender and sexuality, getting into new relationships, exploring ways of expressing sexuality). I would consider my friends my main source of learning about sex.\n\nOne thing I learned from them is that intimacy can be platonic too. My friend group is mainly composed of guys (9 of them versus 4 girls), and they are so...affectionate, even if most of them are straight. They hug each other, tell each other \"I love you (man)\", and give each other gifts (even if they can get *gago* at times; recently, one of my guy friends brought back condoms from Italy). Whenever the group has sleepovers, the guys aren't afraid to sleep close to each other. It's quite heartwarming to see. Even the girls in the group could experience this. For instance: people would often assume I was dating two of my guy best friends because of how intimate they would act towards me (e.g. hugs, leaning towards each other, holding hands); in reality, this was just their way of expressing affection. My friend group also engages in intimacy by sharing our pains together: problematic parents, financial struggles, suicide attempts, etc. Whenever one of us was going through something, the others would definitely show our support as soon as we could, dropping everything to be virtually/physically present with the person.\n\nAnother thing I learned from my friends is that I have the right to speak up for myself. The way I grew up conditioned me to become a people-pleaser, even if I wasn't comfortable/happy with the situation I was in. To counter this, my two best guy friends would constantly remind me of my right. They'd tell me that I could say no anytime, which taught me to keep in touch with my feelings. One other way I learned to stand up for myself was when a sex scandal exploded in our high school, triggering tons of girls to come out with their own stories. At the time, the guys in the friend group had a tendency of making misogyntistic jokes, which left the girls feeling uncomfortable. The scandal motivated us girls to speak up about this with our guy friends. They listened well, validated our feelings, and apologized, which completely touched us. Even if my friend group isn't perfect, I am grateful to have a safe space where I can grow with them.\n\n#### Rethinking (In)Fidelity\nWhat do we really mean by infidelity? Is infidelity the end of a relationship or the beginning of a new one? How do we rethink it? In this TED Talk by Esther Perel, she highlights new ways of understanding such a phenomenon.\n\n**[Esther Perel: Rethinking infidelity....a talk for anyone who ever loved](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpp1nlx2aPM)**\n- Questions\n\t- Why do we cheat, and why do happy people cheat?\n\t- How do we see/define infidelity?\n\t- Why do we think that men cheat out of boredom and fear of intimacy but women cheat out of loneliness and hunger for intimacy?\n\t- Is an affair always the end of a relationship?\n- Infidelity has a tenacity that marriage can only envy\n- How do we reconcile what is universally forbidden yet universally practiced?\n- Tribe history\n\t- Men had a license to cheat, with practically little consequence\n\t- Supported by a host of biological and evolutionary theories that justified their need to roam\n- Monogamy used to be one person for life. Today, monogamy is one person at a time.\n- Monogamy had nothing to do with love.\n\t- men relied on women's fidelity in order to know whose children these are and who gets the cows when I die\n- The definition of infidelity keeps on expanding.\n\t- E.G. sexting, watching porn, staying secretly active on dating apps \n\t- Because there is no universally agreed-upon definition of what even constitutes an infidelity\n- Definition of an affair through three key elements:\n\t- a secretive relationship (core structure of an affair) \n\t- an emotional connection to one degree or another \n\t- a sexual alchemy\n- Marcel Proust: \"It's our imagination that is responsible for love, not the other person\"\n- When marriage was an economic enterprise, infidelity threatened our economic security. But now that marriage is a romantic arrangement, infidelity threatens our ==emotional security.==\n- Ironically, we used to turn to adultery -- that was the space where we sought pure love. But now that we seek love in marriage, adultery destroys it.\n- Three ways infidelity hurts different today:\n\t- We have a romantic ideal in which we turn to one person to fulfill an endless list of needs (e.g. greatest lover, best friend, best parent, trusted confidant, etc.). \n\t\t- This tell us we're chosen, indispensable, irreplaceable, etc. And infidelity tells us that we're not. It is the ultimate betrayal.\n\t- In the past, infidelity has always been painful. Now, it is also traumatic because it threatens our ==sense of self==.\n\t\t- Infidelity is a violation of trust, a crisis of identity\n\t\t- Affairs in the digital age: death by a thousand cuts\n\t- We are relying on our partners fidelity in with a unique fervor, but we also have never been more inclined to stray.\n\t\t- And not because we have new desires today, but because we live in an era where we feel that we are entitled to pursue our desires (i.e. \"I deserve to be happy\")\n\t\t- If we used to divorce because we were unhappy, today we divorce because we could be happier. And if divorce carried all the shame, today choosing to stay when you can leave is the new shame\n- So if we can divorce, why do we still have affairs? Now the typical assumption is that if someone cheats, it's either there's something wrong in your relationship or wrong with you.\n\t- But millions of people can't all be pathological. Logic: if you have everything you need at home, why go out? If you have a perfect marriage, why cheat?\n\t- But what if passion is a finite shelf life? What if there are things that even a good relationship can never provide?\n- Most cheaters are not chronic philanders. They are people who are conflicted between their values and behavior.\n- Affairs are an act of betrayal, and they are also an expression of ==longing and loss==. \n\t- At the heart of an affair, you will often find a longing and a yearning for an emotional connection, for novelty, for freedom, for autonomy, for sexual intensity, a wish to recapture lost parts of ourselves, or an attempt to bring back vitality in the face of loss and tragedy.\n\t- One word to describe affairs: they feel alive\n- Affairs are way less about sex and a lot more about ==desire. ==\n\t- Desire for attention, desire to feel special, desire to feel important\n\t- The very structure of an affair -- the fact that you can never have your lover -- keeps you wanting: that in itself is a desire machine.\n- Affairs, when exposed, may make way for a whole new kind of truth.\n\t- E.G. honest and open conversations, rekindled sexual desire\n- So when affairs are exposed, what can couples do?\n\t- We know from trauma that ==healing begins== when the perpetrator ==acknowledges their wrongdoing.==\n\t- It is essential to do things that bring back a sense of self-worth (through being surrounded by friends and keeping busy with activities). \n\t- But even more important is to curb the curiosity to mine for the sordid details. Instead switch to the investigative questions, the ones that mine ==the meaning and the motives.==\n\t\t- E.G. \"What did this affair mean to you?\"; \"What were you able to express or experience there that you could no longer do with me?\" ETC.\n- Betrayal in a relationship comes in many forms. There are many ways that we betray our partner: with contempt, with neglect, with indifference, with violence. Sexual betrayal is only one way to hurt a partner. \n\t- In other words, the victim of an affair is not always the victim of the marriage.\n- Takeaway: look at affairs from a dual perspective. Hurt and betrayal on one side, growth and self-discovery on the other. What it did to you, and what it meant for me.\n\n#### Integrating Ideas\nHere are some key integrating ideas and reflection questions:\n-  **Sexual citizenship**¬†is not about being \"liberated\" but ==respecting people's rights to their sexual lives.== In the same way that citizenship affords you rights and responsibilities, being sexual citizens provides you with similar rights and responsibilities. People have sex for different reasons, and you have to think about what reasons you have for it.\n-   Discussion on¬†**sex and sexuality**¬†is usually shrouded with a lot of¬†**shame and silence**. What are things that we need to talk about? What are things that need to be discussed more? Masturbation? Non-marital sex? Hooking up? LGBTQ issues? Open relationships? Dating apps? Kinks? BDSM?\n-   Often, we talk about¬†**sexual intimacy¬†and¬†long-term relationships**¬†together with each other. But what happens when these relationships break down because of issues of trust? As we've seen, ==an infidelity challenges our sense of self, identity, and emotional security.== It's not so much the sex as it is the betrayal of trust--the realization that we were insufficient. But is an infidelity always the end of a relationship, or could it be the start of a new one?\n-   **Intimacy can come in different forms**. Not everything is about sex. Intimacy can come in friendship--in a sharing of life's hurts, pains, pleasures, and joys. How are you living out this intimacy?\n\nBelow, please share about what¬†**ideas you want to talk more about**¬†and what¬†**insights were inspired in you**¬†after the videos you've just watched.\n\n##### Answer\n**Questions to take on:**\n- shame and silence\n- intimacy can come in different forms\n\nGiven that discussion on sex and sexuality is usually shrouded with shame and silence, one thing that I believe needs to be talked about more is **asexuality**. What most people don't know is that asexuality is an umbrella term, and it exists on a spectrum. This can lead to many misconceptions surrounding asexuality. For instance, asexuals aren't always sex-repulsed; there are also asexuals who are sex-neutral or sex-positive. And desiring libido or intimacy (whether romantic or platonic) does not disqualify one from asexuality. These misconceptions can lead to many people being confused about their sexuality; I am one such example.\n\nIt was in college when I realized that I may belong in the asexual spectrum. The feeling of sexual attraction was odd and unfamiliar to me (I never had celebrity or fictional crushes), so online dating and one-night stands ‚Äî concepts heavily dependent on physical appearance ‚Äî weirded me out. The only time I experienced this kind of attraction was when I was dating my best friend back in high school. So when I came across demisexuality, an orientation that requires close emotional connection for sexual attraction, it resonated a lot with me. However, it took me a long time to come to terms with this because of numerous doubts caused by misconceptions. Isn't this experience normal? Do I still qualify if I've experienced masturbation and/or sex, and am still open it? How come I can't relate to other aces? I was only able to quell these doubts by researching a lot online, along with confiding with other friends (who were also going through similar struggles). These processes helped me because I realized I wasn't alone in my struggle; if sex and sexuality wasn't such a taboo topic, others like me would definitely get the help they'd need.\n\nCurrently, I'm choosing to stay single (even if I desire a romantic relationship, it's not something I'm fully open to yet). While this can feel lonely at times (especially when most of your friends are happily taken), I've been fulfilling my need for intimacy in other ways: warm hugs, deep conversations, and self-care.  Having a more inclusive definition of intimacy has helped me acknowledge my emotions instead of repressing them (thanks to years of conditioning from being immersed in the conservative culture of Filipino families and Catholic schools). I wish others would be able to experience a similar level of emotional security.\n\n![[images/Asexuality.png]]\n\n#### Podcast\n\n\u003e The podcast is a¬†**10‚Äì15-minute conversation with a person**¬†that the student chooses, trying to integrate the content of the discussion to the topic in class about relationships, social networks, and/or intimacy.\n\u003e It can be with a friend, partner, professor, or loved one‚Äîeither about social capital and how they leveraged it OR ==about their thoughts on intimacy and a mature, loving relationship.==\n\u003e Please write a short reflection/synthesis on how what the person said and what you learned in class are connected.

In your perspective (i.e. Psych background, asexuality), what is your perception of intimacy?\n2. How do you live intimacy in your life, whether romantically or platonically?\n3. Connected to this...what makes a relationship mature and loving?\n4. After fights, how do you rekindle intimacy in your current relationship?\n\n##### Takeaways\nIntimacy is a two way-street; it requires an established set of rules between two people in a relationship, whether it's of a romantic or platonic nature. And just as intimacy can come in many forms (e.g. physical presence, emotional support), so can betrayals in relationships; you can commit infidelity not just sexually, but also emotionally. But fights can also serve as a form of communication, helping people in relationships align and grow together. However, it's important to not let anger take over during a fight; this is because it prevents people from discovering the meaning and motives behind their partner's actions, which is necessary for aligning in relationships.\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T15:56:57.00413649Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2023-02-23":{"title":"2023-02-23","content":"## Historical and Philosophical Foundations of Education\n#EDUC101i #education #philosophy #history \n### Critical Reflection Essay 1: Ancient-Medieval Times\n#### Instructions\n1.  **Describe**¬†an issue/trend in Philippine Education that is predominant today (ex. student discipline, participation of women, use of technology in teaching, etc.)¬†Cite relevant sources to explain the issue and to justify its relevance in Philippine Education.¬†You can draw from articles from news outlets/official government documents and/or published academic work from experts/reputable institutions.

Intellectual discipline (faith seeking understanding)\n\t\t\t\t- No to unquestioned obedience to authority...provide a safe space for questioning/inquiry\n\t\t\t- Aquinasa provided a framework for open scientific inquiry\n\t- Generally though, I'd argue that these eras didn't really solve the problem haha\n\t\t- In both eras, it can be seen how curriculums were designed for the sake of the state\n- Ideas\n\t- Social media as the new classroom\n\t- the dangers of relying on curated information (e.g. modules, social media content)\n\t- related to instagram activism? lmao\n\t- importance of media like Maria Ibarra at Klara haha\n\t- End with a quote from Ambeth Ocampo or something haha\n\n##### Outline\n1. Describe the issue/trend\n\t1. Prevalent issue: information crisis\n\t\t1. From Microscale (the infodemic...information about COVID) to Macroscale (politics, history being warped)\n\t\t2. The Infodemic: \"under the cover of a global pandemic, governments have undermined freedom and taken control‚Äîthis new political order may be the legacy of the disease.\"\n\t\t3. Philippines is considered as \"patient zero\" in the fake news epidemic\n\t\t\t1. this is due to our heavy immersion in technology\n\t\t\t2. idol culture...entertainment value\n\t\t\t3. Anti-intellectualism (should I move to effect?)\n\t\t\t4. Big Tech platform neglect\n\t2. How this issue affects education\n\t\t1. Removal of subjects like history in the curriculum, since they aren't seen as valuable\n\t\t2. If it's still included, it's used to propagate misinformation through curated modules\n\t\t3. Social media is the new classroom, and is also used to propagate misinformation through \"influencers\"\n\t3. Long-term consequences: democracy\n\t\t1. Rise of right-wing populism\n\t\t\t1. Red-tagging\n\t\t\t2. censorship\n\t\t\t3. Election of Duterte and Marcos\n2. How was this issue handled?\n\t1. In Ancient-Medieval Times\n\t2. In the present\n\t\t1. Truth-fluencers like historians and independent journalists\n3. Reflection\n\t1.  What are some personal insights that you can draw from the process?¬†\n\t\t1. it seems like we're going backwards, progress wise\n\t2.  What are the benefits and limitations of reviewing the issue/trend‚Äôs historical underpinnings?\n\t\t1. Benefits\n\t\t\t1. We are prepared...history repeats itself\n\t\t2. Limitations\n\t\t\t1. We may close ourself off to possibiltiies...if we always assume that history repeats itself....and prevent ourselves from trying to change this \n\t3.  Looking into the future, what factors or forces might continue to affect the direction of the issue/trend?\n\t\t1.

Why do people live this kind of life?**\n\t- The masked and armored life is a life where our roles (what we act as in the \"real world\") is divided from our souls (who we truly are). This is what it looks like...\n\t\t- Sensing that something is missing in our lives and searching for it, not understanding that we are the ones who are missing\n\t\t- Feeling fradulent, even invisible, because we are not in the world as who we really are\n\t\t- The light that is within us cannot illuminate the world's darkness\n\t\t- The darkness that is within us cannot be illuminated by the world's light\n\t\t- We project our inner darkness on others, making \"enemies\" of them and making the world a more dangerous place\n\t\t- Our inauthenticity and projections make real relationships impossible, leading to loneliness\n\t\t- Our contributions to the world -- especially through the work we do -- are tainted by duplicity and deprived of the life-giving energies of the true self\n\t- People live this kind of life because our culture has taught us that this is the safe and sane way to live.\n-   **Why do people need what Palmer calls¬†_circles of trust?_**\n\t- Community is essential to rejoining soul and role. This is what a circle of trust is for; it makes it safe for the soul to show up and offers us its guidance. Circles of trust support (rather than supplant) the individual quest for integrity. \n\t- These circles are rooted in 2 basic beliefs:\n\t\t- We all have an inner teacher whose guidance is more reliable than anything we can get from an external source (e.g. doctrine, ideology, collective belief system, institution, leader)\n\t\t- We all need other people to invite, amplify, and help us discern the inner teacher's voice for 3 reasons:\n\t\t\t- The journey toward inner truth is too taxing to be made solo: lacking support, the solitary traveler soon becomes weary or fearful and is likely to quit the road.\n\t\t\t- The path is too deeply hidden to be travelled without company: finding our way involves cues that are subtle and sometimes misleading, requiring the kind of discernment that can happen only in dialogue\n\t\t\t- The destination is too daunting to be achieved alone: we need community to find the courage to venture into the alien lands to which the inner teacher calls us\n\n## Historical and Philosophical Foundations of Education\n#EDUC101i #education #history #philosophy \n### Module 3.1:¬†**The Renaissance**\nTo guide your thinking in this module, we will anchor our discussions on this essential question¬†**\"What is most important to learn?\"** _First, we will explore a famous movement called the Renaissance, and how the rise of Science and Art (spoiler alert) shifted the tides of education._\n\n#### Looking into the renaissance\nAs many historians have described it, the Renaissance Movement \"was¬†a fervent period of European cultural, artistic, political and economic ‚Äúrebirth‚Äù¬†**following the Middle Ages**.¬† Therefore, to understand the renaissance movement, it might help by starting to compare it to the middle ages. To make it a little interesting, let's continue to use art as a way to uncover what this whole movement was all about!\n\n1. Spend 2-3 minutes looking at some art in [this virtual exhibit from the Medieval Period](https://artsandculture.google.com/partner/museu-episcopal-de-vic)\n2. Then, spend another 2-3 minutes looking at some [art from the Renaissance Period](https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/renaissance/m06cvx?categoryid=art-movement)\n3. Compare the art of the 2 periods, what do you notice? Try to take note of 2-3 things - it can be in terms of the subject of the art, the style? the color? etc.¬† \n\n#### The two faces of humanism\n- To give you a head start, here's a brief overview to set-up the context of the Renaissance Movement.\n- **[What Was the Renaissance? AP Euro Bit by Bit #1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txKiku3qJN4)**\n\t- Renaissance means ==rebirth== and that's how intellectuals saw the time they were living in\n\t- Renaissance thinkers viewed the Middle Ages as a vast chasm that ==divided== them from the ==glory of the ancient world==\n\t- The Renaissance focused on a new appreciation of the ==abilities of the individual==, and along the way, this new focus created what we now recognize is the ==modern world==\n- The early renaissance in Italy put much premium on ==personal culture, individual freedom, and development to attain a full life.== Hence, it was referred to as¬†**[[Individual humanism]].**¬† \n- The renaissance movement¬† that later on spread in northern Europe stressed social and moral reform as instrumental to achieving a meaningful life.¬† It was know as¬†**[[Social humanism]].**¬†\n- These two \"types\" of renaissance gave rise two educational systems.¬†Read this excerpt¬†to learn about the distinct features of these educational systems.\n\n##### Discussion Board\nIn the discussion forum below, share:\n1. **3 ideas**¬†that caught your attention about individual or social humanism (label for alignment. Ex. Idea 1(individual).¬†\n2.¬†**2 \"quotable quotes\"**¬†from the excerpt that you think captures the essence of the Renaissance's contribution to education.\n3.¬†**1 question**¬†that you would like to pose to our learning community (either a point for clarification and/or a reflection question to help us connect to our current context).\n\n**1. 3 IDEAS**\n\t1. Individual humanism: Students of Renaissance schools were exposed to three previously unknown aspects of life: the vibrant life of the past, the subjective world of the emotions, and the world of nature. \n\t2. Individual humanism: Vittorino representing the advent of the professional teacher: pioneering the formulation of important doctrines, championing the development of interest and critical thinking, advocating for holistic development (e.g. importance of physical activity and play)\n\t3. Social humanism: The humanistic educators of the north proposed methods way ahead of their time, such as _The Liberal Education of Children_ and _The Method of Study_. \n**2. 2 QUOTES**\n\t1. Individual humanism: \"Sufficient motivation was to be found in the fact that the higher posts of honor and activity in the life of the times were open only to those who had been thoroughly trained in the humanistic manner.\" (p. 168)\n\t2. Social humanism: \"Where the child doth well, let the master praise him and say, 'Here ye do well,' for there is no such whetstone to sharpen a hard wit and encourage a will to learning, as is praise.\" (p. 172)\n**3. 1 QUESTION:** \"How exactly did broad humanism transition into 'Ciceronianism' (did it naturally happen, or did something trigger it)?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T15:56:57.00413649Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2023-02-28":{"title":"2023-02-28","content":"## Discerning Life Questions\n#DLQ10 #religion #spirituality #philosophy\n### Being the Beloved (Henri J.M. Nouwen)\n\u003e To summarize the first part of this module, let us listen to Henri Nouwen himself as he talks about the divided and conflicted ways in which we attempt to define ourselves. But in the end, he also gives us hope for an alternative way  of living which can leads us closer to being in touch with our true selves. In Christian parlance, this is what we call **being the beloved of God.**\n\n**[\"Being the Beloved\" (FULL SERMON Part One) | Henri Nouwen at the Crystal Cathedral](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trG7Oh_PopM)**\n- The core of that faith belongs to my conviction that you and I and are the beloved daughters and sons of God.\n- One of the enormous spiritual tasks we have is to claim that and to live a life based on that knowledge.\n- Most of us fail constantly to claim the truth of who we are.\n- The question for you and me: who are we? That's the question that keeps us going; for our whole lives, we try to answer that question: \"Who am I?\"\n  - The first answer we live with: \"I am what I do\"\n  - Second answer: \"I am what other people say about me\"\n  - Third answer: \"I am what i have\"\n- When you live this kind of life, with all these ups and downs, the end is death. When you are dead, you're dead.\n  - Nobody talks about you anymore. You don't have anything anymore. You can't do anything anymore.\n  - You lose it all and that little life of you and of mine ends up into nothing.\n- ^ This whole thing is wrong. That is not who you are, and that is not who I am.\n  - Jesus says that's a lie. That's the greatest lie that makes you and me enter into relationships of violence and destruction. Because I know who I am.\n- Jesus heard that voice: \"You are my beloved. You are my favorite.\" and it was that voice that he clung to as he lived his life.\n  - Jesus held on to the truth: whatever happens, I am the beloved of God and that is who I am. And that allows me to live in a world that keeps rejecting me, or praising me, or laughing at me, or spitting on me.\n- We too can cling to this truth. I am the beloved not because people say i'm great, but because I am the beloved even before I was born.\n  - When you accept this, your life will become more and more the lifeof the beloved because that's who you are\n  - You start discovering that all that you do here is nurtured from the knowledge that you are the beloved. That's who you are.\n- When you start believing this, that circle of knowledge will go become bigger and bigger and bigger until it cuts right into your daily life.\n  - You will still have rejections. You will still have praise. And you will still have losses. But you live no longer as a person searching for his/her identity, but you will live it as the beloved.\n  - You will love your pain and you will live your anguish and you will live your successes and you will live your failures as the one who knows who you are.\n- The voice that calls you the beloved is the voice of the first love.\n  - John writes: love one another because God has loved you first\n  - The great struggle is to claim that first love.\n- Hard truth: The people who love us do not always love us well. \n  - How can we live this truth: that in this world, love and wounds are never separated?\n  - We can only live it when we always reclaim that first love. So that we can forgive those who love us poorly, but also so that we can recognize in the love that we do receive a hint or a glimpse of that first love.\n- If I can hold on to that (this first love) and live in the world, then I can be free to love other people without expecting them to give me all that my heartfelt desires, because God has created you and me with a heart that only God's love can satisfy.\n  - If we are willing to let the pain not make us bitter, but prune us to give us a deeper sense of our belovedness, then we can be free as Jesus and walk on this world and proclaim God's first love wherever we go.\n\n## Henri Nouwen on Brokenness\nFrom \"Broken\" in _Life of the Beloved_, 1992\n\n\u003e There are many things I would like to say to you about brokenness. But where to begin?\n\u003e \n\u003e Perhaps the simplest beginning would be to say that our brokenness reveals something about who we are. Our sufferings and pains are not simply bothersome interruptions of our lives; rather they touch us in our uniqueness and our most intimate individuality.\n\n\u003e The way I am broken tells you something unique about me. The way you are broken tells me something unique about you. That is the reason for my feeling very privileged when you freely share some of your deep pain with me, and that is why it is an expression of my trust in you when I disclose to you something of my vulnerable side.\n\n\u003e Our brokenness is always lived and experienced as highly personal, intimate, and unique. I am deeply convinced that each human being suffers in a way no human being suffers. No doubt, we can make comparisons; we can talk about more or less suffering, but, in the final analysis, your pain and my pain are so deeply personal that comparing them can bring scarcely any consolation or comfort.\n\n\u003e In fact, I am more grateful for a person who can acknowledge that I am very alone in my pain than for someone who tries to tell me that there are many others who have a similar or worse pain.\n\n\u003e Our brokenness is truly ours. Nobody else's. Our brokenness is as unique as our chosenness and blessedness. The way we are broken is as much an expression of individuality as the way we are taken and blessed. Yes, fearsome as it may sound, as the Beloved ones, we are called to reclaim our unique brokenness, just as we have to claim our unique chosenness and blessedness.\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T15:56:57.00413649Z","tags":null},"/Miscellaneous-Notes/Freestyle-Workshop":{"title":"Freestyle Workshop","content":"Concepts from **Coach Reflex**\n1.

The primary mechanism through which the damaged brain can repair and restore itself is called ‚Äúneuroplasticity.‚Äù\n\n\u003e Neuroplasticity is defined as ==the ability of the brain to form and reorganize the synaptic connections between neurons.== Neuroplasticity is an essential component of the learning process and of the brain‚Äôs response to injury, including traumatic brain injury (TBI) and stroke. Essentially, neuroplasticity refers to ==the brain‚Äôs ability to ‚Äúrewire‚Äù itself in response to new experiences and information.==\n\u003e Neuroplasticity is a two-way street; stressful, traumatic experiences impact neuroplasticity, causing the brain to develop and repeatedly utilize maladaptive pathways that are not conducive to optimal health.

It's basically all about unplugging and retreating from technology. \n- driven by [[Permanent Notes/Fear of Being Ordinary]] and ego-attachment\n\n\u003e ==philosophy of relating to technology== I call Waldenponding (after ==Thoreau's Walden Pond experiment== on which Walden is based). The crude caricature is \"smash your smart phone and go live in a log cabin to reclaim your attention and your life from being hacked by evil social media platforms.\"\n\n### Against Waldenponding 2\n- Waldenponding is the ==demonization of digital devices.== \n\t- But devices are actually more like magic tricks; they're designed by humans to misdirect your attention.\n\t- Manipulate you into creating Walden ponds\n\n\u003e  ==Waldenponding = primitivist, fetishistic fear of screens as demonic objects.== A way of relating to digital devices that seems shaped by a fearmongering vision of them as soul-sucking pumps, and their designers as Dark Lords who are far too powerful for you, mere mortal,  to actively resist. Your only reliable weapon, they say, is the off switch.\n\n\u003e  ==demonization of digital devices== -- perfectly ordinary objects governed by the laws of physics and designed by mere humans --  is something like a magic trick, where the magician wants to misdirect your attention. While you're busy worrying about the evil rectangles of light stealing your soul, you are missing the real danger: the horcruxes they are tempting you to create and trust with legibilized, dead bits of your soul.\n\n- Waldenponding is a search for meaning similar to ==idolization.== The idol here can be anything that's not a digital device.\n\t- E.G. paper book, session of manual labor, hike in the woods\n\t- They act as tangible focal points which the quests (for meaning) ==revolve around,== preventing one from going too far.\n\t- This is what makes Waldenponding dangerous, and it's worse because it's ==seen as a way to do the opposite== (idolization)\n\n\u003e  Waldenponding is a search for meaning that is ==circumscribed by the what you might call the spiritual gravity field of an object or behavior held up as ineffably sacred.== The associated literal pattern of religiosity is idolatry. Today, the ==\"idol\"== in question is generally characterized by negative definition as ==\"almost anything other than the profane digital device screen.\"== It can take a variety of forms: the in-person conversation, the board game, the hike in the woods, the session of manual labor, the construction project, the family dinner, the paper book. All are excellent things, to be valued for what they literally are. But as suggested repositories for bits of your soul, they are incredibly dangerous.\n\n\u003e  the loci at the hearts of the narratives are more than mere motifs or synecdoches for larger spiritual quests. They serve as ==physically embodied focal points around which the quests themselves revolve,== like strange attractors. Though the protagonists may, through the narrative, explore the universe in much more expansive ways, you can see where they keep bits of their souls locked down; the zone that keeps drawing them back; the idol that prevents them from wandering too far.\n\n\u003e  Each in its natural form is a perfectly fine thing. ==It is only when transformed into sacralized fragments of \"soul\" that they turn into dangerous Dark Magic objects. Waldenponding is dangerous because it encourages you to do exactly that.== The effect is particularly insidious because it is presented as a way to do the opposite.\n\n- Waldenponding prevents us from experiencing all that life has to offer.","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T15:56:57.00813658Z","tags":null},"/Permanent-Notes/We-serve-others-through-our-emotional-labor":{"title":"We serve others through our emotional labor","content":"## Reference\n- **Source:** [[Seth Godin]]; [[Resource Notes/This is Marketing - Book]]\n- **Keywords:** [[Permanent Notes/permanent notes]]\n\t- #people #psychology \n- **Relevant Notes:**\n\t- [[Permanent Notes/Publicity is costly]]\n\t- [[Permanent Notes/Everybody gets to choose what they worship]]\n\t- [[Permanent Notes/The best way to serve others with our work is to serve the work]]\n## Notes\n- **Definition:** the process of managing feelings and expressions to fulfill the emotional requirements of a job\n- mostly seen with service workers","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T15:56:57.00813658Z","tags":null},"/Permanent-Notes/Willpower-and-motivation-is-finite":{"title":"Willpower and motivation is finite","content":"## Reference\n- **Source:** [[Resource Notes/In Online Ed Content Is No Longer King - Cohorts Are - Essay]]\n- **Keywords:** [[Permanent Notes/permanent notes]]\n- **Relevant Notes:** \n\t- [[Permanent Notes/More access does not translate to more engagement]]\n\t- [[Permanent Notes/You have agency over your own attention]]\n## Notes\nSelf-directed programs (i.e. workout programs, diet plans, online courses) rely on ==learners' willpower \u0026 motivation== to stick through a course.

An archaeology of design is an archaeology of curiousity.\n\n### 1. The Mirror of Design\n\n\u003e Design always presents itself as serving the human but its real ambition is to redesign the human. \n\n\u003e The history of design is therefore a history of evolving conceptions of the human. To talk about design is to talk about the state of our species.\n\n\u003e We literally live inside design...design has become the world.\n\n\u003e To think about design demands an archaeological approach. You have to dig...Digging, documenting, dissecting, discussing -- digging, that is, into ourselves.\n\n\u003e [Archaeology] is a kind of reverse engineering of design.\n\n\u003e Design is a form of projection, to shape something rather than to find it, to invent something and think about the possible outcomes of that invention.\n\n\u003e The human might be the only species to have systematically designed its own extinction, and seems to be getting close to accomplishing the goal.\n\n\u003e Our self-image is multiple and ever-shifting, as if we look into a vast multifaceted mirror in which the surfaces keep moving.\n\n\u003e The ability to see so much more is equally the ability to be seen much more...Self-monitoring is a huge part of human activity -- and is insperable from design.\n\n\u003e Artifacts become truly transformative by exceeding what was expected of them, exceeding our grasp. It is precisely in challenging us -- triggering the potential of new ways of seeing, thinking, grasping, and acting -- that design plays its role in redefining the human.\n\n\n### 2. The Plastic Human\n\n\u003e Human is an unstable category, even an unstable being...it is defined by its diversity and plasticity -- its ability to modify its own abilities...it is this plasticity that is the basis of its massive impact...in redesigning itself, it redesigns the planet.\n\n\u003e What makes the human human is...in our interdependency with artifacts...the human is insperable from the artifacts that it produces...the human emerges in the redefinition of capacity provided by the artifacts. In a sense, the artifacts are more human than the human.\n\n\u003e Artifacts are therefore never simply the representstives of human intentions and abilities. They are also openings, possibilities of something new in the human, even a new human. There is always a gap between intentions and what is produced. The artifact offers something unexpected, some additional quality or resistance. This excess opens up new ways of thinking, new modes of design.\n\n\u003e ...histories of the human are histories of artifacts and the interactivities between artifacts, seen as potentials rather than accomplishments, as if the Earth is a vast design studio in which human capacity is being tinkered with in unexpected ways.\n\n\u003e Artifacts are interfaces, enabling different forms of human engagement with the world but equally enabling the world to engage with the human differently.\n\n\u003e The archaeology of design is...the history of a question mark.\n\n### 3. Blows of Design\n\u003e The objects were not just made, they were thought...they are human artifacts because the regularity of the shape \"surely implies design, the application of forethought, and an intelligent purpose.\" The physical implement is first and foremost an instrument of thought.\n\n+ We're older than we think...and more intelligent too.... we challenged religious notions by discovering  prehistory\n+ Charles Darwin: \"unity of design\" is not because of divine intelligence, but because it is a product of the essential mutability of all species\n\t+ Countless incremental adaptations increase the chances of survival in changing environments\n\n\u003e Natural selection is design without a designer.\n\n\u003e The human hand is uniquely adapted to make and use tools. The inherited structure of the body ultimately altered by its technological extensions...human designs eventually redesign the human. We are gradually redesigned by our tools.\n\n\u003e The sustained attempt to develop and promote a concept of \"design\" in everyday objects as a necessary response to the massive impact of industrialization on human life was made during the dramatic encounter with the design of the very first tools and with a destabilizing sense of intimacy with apes and the extended organic world.\n\n\u003e Design itself was understood as the very principle of human evolution in an uncritical celebration of progress -- as if nothing was more human than the ability to modernize oneself.\n\n\u003e The concept of modern design...was part of the ongoing testing of [established concepts of human biological and technological evolution].\n\n\u003e In the end, the design of the earliest tools might be as much about their ornamental beauty as about defined function, visually striking designs to help the survival of the craftsperson's genes by attracting mates.\n\n\u003e If design is the first sign of the human, it is the beginning of a permanent question.\n\n### 4. The Invention of the Human\n\u003e The human becomes human in seeing itself in the things it makes, or seeing its possibility in those things. So the human doesn't simply invent tools. Tools invent the human. More precisely, tool and human produce each other. The artifacts that prosthetically expand thought and reach are what make the human human.\n\n\u003e The body itself is only human by virtue of technology: \"the human hand is human because of what it makes, not of what it is.\"\n\n\u003e The human brain is therefore an effect of new tools rather than the generator of new tools.\n\n\u003e ...a tool is not produced to carry out a defined utilitarian task. Tools are born as challenges to existing concepts of utility. They open up new understandings of what could be useful. Utility is not a given unambiguous need. Ambiguity about utility is what drives new forms of utility.\n\n\u003e ...the main driver of human accomplishment is simply a unique human capacity for variability, an impulse to generate a multiciplity of ways to do things in reaction to different cirumstances...this variability itself can be understood as design capacity...Humans continuously imagine different ways even in the same context, to the point of malfunction.\n\n\u003e The human brain itself is a malleable artifact whose circuits are continually rearranged through engagement with material culture. It is an unfinished project with a forever uncertain future and an equally uncertain beginning.\n\n\u003e Design is by definition unevenly distributed in space and time, often flickering as some innovations disappear for a very long time only to be reinvented again.\n\n\u003e The human is permanently suspended between being the cause and effect, between designing living things and being designed by them.\n\n\u003e What is human in the end is neither the designer nor the artifacts but their interdependency.\n\n### 5. The Ornamental Species\n\u003e The symptoms of recognizably human behavior were the sophistication and complexity of tools, symbols, rituals, and techniques. Even then, this acceleration only became exponential in the last 12,000 years, when \"humans redesigned themselves as organic beings,\" as John Hoffecker puts it, with abstract thinking, composite tools, long-distane networks of production and exchange, cooperative labor, and so on. Countless inventions steadily transformed the species and dramatically altered its relationship to the environment through the \"domestication (that is, *re*designing) of plants and animals.\"\n\n\u003e Ornaments are a key symptom of the human ability to externalize its thoughts in symbolic form -- generating and sharing information rather than simply processing it.\n\n\u003e Ornament both marks and expands the human. It is both a sign of the ability to invent and the very mechanism of invention.\n\n\u003e Ornament...is both a tool of communication and the opening to new forms of tool...\n\n\u003e The human is that species that keeps reflecting on the possible uses of its artifacts and communicating these reflections by making new artifacts, flickering back and forth between ornament and tool.\n\n\u003e ...this multiplicity and malleability...is evidence of the capacity to invent that makes us human, that invents the human even.\n\n\u003e ...what is seen as ornament is doing the real work and what looks like a tool is really for show. And the vibration between them is the very engine of design.\n\n\u003e Design routinely constructs digital inequalities...it is everywhere, and it engineers concentrations of wealth and privilege.\n\n### 6.

The crude caricature is \"smash your smart phone and go live in a log cabin to reclaim your attention and your life from being hacked by evil social media platforms.\"\n- retreating from information flows is just a ==different way of having your attention hacked by others.==\n- If FOMO, Fear Of Missing Out, is the basic fear exploited by third parties that want to drown you in information, the basic fear exploited by people telling you to unplug and retreat is ==FOBO: Fear Of Being Ordinary.==\n![[Attention Management Turnpike.png]]\n- Premise: ==FOMO is good.== Being plugged in is good. There is valuable info at all levels from twitter gossip to philosophy books. You should stay plugged in.\n-  Inspiration from 2 sources: The famous quote ==\"small minds discuss people, average minds discuss events, great minds discuss ideas\"== ( = y axis) and Richard Hamming's idea of scheduling ==\"Great Thoughts\"== calendar time in You and Your Research\n![[Great Thoughts.png]]\n-  you are part of a ==Giant Social Computer in the Cloud (GSCITC)== computing the future. ==The level and latency at which you consume information and act on it determines your \"job\" in the social computer.== Your shitposting and FOMO are functional.\n-  If you don't manage your information economy career, you will default to the lowest-level job in the social computer: ==processing very low-latency information with small-minded cognition (bottom left) for small bets.== It's the equivalent of low-level bug reporting/testing.\n-  The way to manage your attention is to ==be sensitive to your current mind size (small to great)== and ==consciously target the zone you want to be in,== moving fluidly between small/great mind.\n-  There are ==THREE ways to fail== at this: a) Thinking you can be Great Minded all the time. b) Trying to be Great Minded purely on a low-latency information diet (upper-left red box) c) Trying to consume a high-latency information diet without aspiring to more than small-minded thoughts (lower-right red box)\n-  The first failure mode manifests as trying to consume only information at your target level. This will fail. ==You need some information diet input from ALL levels to work at ANY level==\n-  The second failure mode manifests as ==trying to have Great Thoughts on a diet of pure low-latency live information== (upper-left red box).\n-  The final failure mode is trying to ==keep up with all the information at all latencies at a small-minded level== (lower-right red box).\n-  Each failure mode is an information diet that leads to patterns of betting that fail to deliver a positive return long-term. It's not addictive FOMOing that kills you, but ==not being able to translate the information consumption/production choices you're making into winning bets.==\n-  Higher latency requires ==higher abstraction levels/bigger minds== to extract value.\n-  ==Trying to \"float\" your attention at a focused point on the turnpike== rather than distributing attention all along it is the other way to ==fail==\n-  The danger in executing this turnpike roadmap strategy is that ==your mind-level might choose you rather than you choosing your mind-level.==\n-  This is a bit like ==weight training.== You have to increase the weights slowly and perhaps ==train your attention to exhaustion== a bit. If you're in small mind zone and can only consume/produce tweets, try an essay. See how far you get. Strength-train attention from 10s to 10min. You can and should go the other way as well. If you can only read big philosophy books by dead people and processing the chaotic churn of a Toxic Day on Twitter is too much for you, try handling it for 15 minutes, then an hour. Try posting instead of just reading. This is like ==low-weights/high-volume endurance training.== Harder than it looks.\n-  this ==atrophying of attention and latency limits== will happen REGARDLESS of whether evil designers are trying to hack your attention and keep you phase-locked into their preferred 10s latency information loop. ==Their designs are in fact the LOAD you're training against==\n-  information distribution has become free/cheap, so the firehose is going to have flows at all timescales, time constants, and abstraction levels no matter what designers and advertisers want or don't want. ==It's the information firehose itself that's creating this environment not evil designers.==\n-  ==the original attention hack: powerful religious leaders== telling smart people to check out and unplug from information flows. That way, they get the power\n-  This game is based on the opposite fear to FOMO which I call FOBO. If FOMO is Fear of Missing Out, FOBO is Fear Of Being Ordinary.\n-  When you are plugged into the GSCITC, ==you are part of a great computational fluidization of human cognition.== You're just ==one instance== in a liquid cloud of human intelligence, your thoughts entangled with those of others in a giant ongoing computation.\n-  This fluidization is a different emergent social phenomenon from the homogenization achieved by Organization Man corporations. ==Instead of being a faceless interchangeable part, you are a unique entangled particle in a quantum soup.==\n-  The cost though is that even if your contributions are unique and your personal payoff makes it worthwhile if you do it right, ==the one thing the liquid cloud can't offer you is individual recognition.==\n-  The GSCITC is not a homogenizer of effort or imagination, but ==it IS a homogenizer of egos and identities. ==What you do counts. Who you are doesn't. You are an ordinary part of an extraordinary process.\n-  This is the heart of FOBO. Fear of Being Ordinary. ==Fear of being just another entangled particle in the GSCITC.== Fear of your ego dissolving into the collective ego. Fear of having \"nothing to show\" for playing a part, despite it being sustainable.\n-  Waldenponding, I strongly suspect, is ==driven more by FOBO and ego-attachment== than by any real fear of having your mind, productive potential, and rewards destroyed by \"hacked attention.\"\n-  A real adept oughta be able to meditate on the angriest, most toxic twitter stream, consume the bile, and turn it into nectar: ==actionable insight you can bet on in the real world.==\n-  ==A real adept ought to have strength-trained attention== so they can spend an hour either reading a tweetstream or a once-in-a-generation history-disrupting philosophy book.\n-  We are all now part of a powerful global social computer in the cloud that is possibly ==the only mechanism we have available to tackle the big problems of the world that industrial age mechanisms are failing to cope with.== We might as well get good at it. Do your part. Stay as plugged in as you can.\n\n### Against Waldenponding 2\nhttps://breakingsmart.substack.com/p/against-waldenponding-ii\n- never trust anything that can make its own meaning if you can see where it keeps its soul.\n- \"soul\" loosely as a ==metaphor for meaning-making ability.==\n- Unlike intelligence, a soul (metaphoric or literal) ==isn't supposed to take on such a tangible form factor==\n- Meaning-making entities -- humans, and organizations -- can only be trusted if they don't seem to know for sure where their soul is.\n- Believe it or not, this nebulous philosophical allegory is central to the seemingly mundane question of ==how much time you should be spending staring at the screens of digital devices.== Interestingly though, it is NOT our digital devices that are the untrustworthy horcruxes in this story. ==The true horcruxes are the objects that waldenponders believe are more deserving of your attention: the Walden ponds.==\n- you aren't an NPC -- non-playing/playable character -- in the battle for your own attention. You have tools ranging from ad blockers to cognitive reframes. If you're letting your attention get \"hacked\", it's because you're choosing to. ==If you think the only kind of agency you have is the agency to uncritically withdraw to save your soul, you've been pwned, but it isn't by the tech platforms.==\n- ==Waldenponding = primitivist, fetishistic fear of screens as demonic objects.== A way of relating to digital devices that seems shaped by a fearmongering vision of them as soul-sucking pumps, and their designers as Dark Lords who are far too powerful for you, mere mortal,  to actively resist. Your only reliable weapon, they say, is the off switch.\n- ==demonization of digital devices== -- perfectly ordinary objects governed by the laws of physics and designed by mere humans --  is something like a magic trick, where the magician wants to misdirect your attention. While you're busy worrying about the evil rectangles of light stealing your soul, you are missing the real danger: the horcruxes they are tempting you to create and trust with legibilized, dead bits of your soul.\n- Waldenponding is a search for meaning that is ==circumscribed by the what you might call the spiritual gravity field of an object or behavior held up as ineffably sacred.== The associated literal pattern of religiosity is idolatry. Today, the ==\"idol\"== in question is generally characterized by negative definition as ==\"almost anything other than the profane digital device screen.\"== It can take a variety of forms: the in-person conversation, the board game, the hike in the woods, the session of manual labor, the construction project, the family dinner, the paper book. All are excellent things, to be valued for what they literally are. But as suggested repositories for bits of your soul, they are incredibly dangerous.\n- the loci at the hearts of the narratives are more than mere motifs or synecdoches for larger spiritual quests. They serve as ==physically embodied focal points around which the quests themselves revolve,== like strange attractors. Though the protagonists may, through the narrative, explore the universe in much more expansive ways, you can see where they keep bits of their souls locked down; the zone that keeps drawing them back; the idol that prevents them from wandering too far.\n- Each in its natural form is a perfectly fine thing. ==It is only when transformed into sacralized fragments of \"soul\" that they turn into dangerous Dark Magic objects. Waldenponding is dangerous because it encourages you to do exactly that.== The effect is particularly insidious because it is presented as a way to do the opposite.\n- Horcrux tests: ==do you know where it keeps its brain?== And ==Does it seem to embody a \"soul\" in more tangible form than you'd expect== from our everyday casual-spiritual sense of the term?\n- First horcrux answer: Nope! ==Each object/activity pair is usually portrayed by waldenponders as a client device connected to a vast cloud of inherited cultural intelligence.== And they are right! Each of these objects/behavior is a classic horcrux candidate because it is ==old enough for illegible, unplottable patterns of cultural intelligence to have formed around it. You cannot probe this intelligence, only surrender to it through ceremonial, mythologized behaviors==\n- Second horcrux answer: Yep! Waldenponders talk of these things as tangible embodiments and reliable catalysts of ineffable states of mind. They are ==secular equivalents of temples.==\n- Same tests applied to devices: ==Do you know where it keeps its intelligence? And Is it a legible piece of soul?==\n- Answers: yes (it‚Äôs in ram, data center, etc.) and no (==While there is definitely a soul to digital life, it definitely does not have an exact address or form or a predictable way to find it.== The locus of \"soul\" in digital media is so nebulous, our entire experience of online life is necessarily built around search functions. Every day you must head out and look for a fresh glimpse of it, expecting it in unexpected places.)\n- Organizations can waldenpond too.\n- Technology is about constantly creating new vistas of experience, new unpaved territories for us to explore with cowpaths that then get paved. Some present tougher growth challenges for humans than others, but ==no particular type or generation of technology has a monopoly on soul-destruction, preservation, or enrichment.==\n- ==To live richly is to trust your soul to the universe at large, and the experiences it offers that we build technology to access more of.== The opposite of keeping your soul in a known safe space is constantly looking for signs of it in the ==stream of experiences that constitute life itself,== and ==digital life== is a particularly rich new part of that stream. Our challenge is not to keep returning to a  sense of the sacred in the same predictable place, but to ==keep rediscovering that predictable sense of the sacred in new places.==\n- if you ==consistently approach rather than retreat from the universe,== soul-enriching stuff will dominate.\n- If you waldenpond...then nothing will happen","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T15:56:57.00813658Z","tags":null},"/Resource-Notes/Capitalism-in-virtual-worlds-Essay":{"title":"Capitalism in virtual worlds - Essay","content":"## Reference\n- **Source:**\n- **Keywords:** [[Permanent Notes/permanent notes]]\n- **Relevant Notes:**  #metaverse #games #web3 #capitalism \n## Notes\n\u003e I quickly realized how much extra features the premium members got that I didn‚Äôt get.

I saw value in owning those exclusive jpegs to put on my character, and ==I wanted those jpegs in _context_ because I wanted to be a part of _them_.==\n\n\u003e ==Much of this gated access to digital goods reminds me of present day gated online crypto communities.== In [Friends with Benefits](https://www.fwb.help/), a cultural membership-based DAO, you are required to possess set number of tokens to join the community and access the resources within. The value of the community comes from the desire from those outside to be a part of it, and the value is there because of how people place value in it. It‚Äôs like ‚Äúpaying the digital rent‚Äù to invest in a property as a member of the community and selling it off after leaving the community, with the expectation that the token value will grow stronger with the people and network over time.\n\n\u003e On the flip side, my experience in VRChat was much different. In VRChat, you embody a 3D avatar and teleport into 3D worlds that are community-created. There are no classes for digital goods, and anyone can fully express themselves with any avatar available in the community without restriction. My first experience felt unusual because I wasn‚Äôt used to everything being ungated and free for use. **I realized I had become used to ==better digital goods being gated and inaccessible to the public== when I felt weird taking all the digital goods without pay.**\n\n\u003e In the digital world of Discord servers, DAOs, and VRChat worlds that represent online cities and countries with tokens or in-game currency as the currency of virtual nation-communities, I==‚Äôm constantly reminded that we need not carry the same mistakes of the real world into the digital world. ==Instead, I‚Äôm curious on what a model that would not be a repeat of hyper-capitalism would look like. It didn‚Äôt take understanding a capitalistic system fully to feel insecure about inequality in my childhood MMOs. I‚Äôm continually learning the economics of what the future of organization might look like, and am hopeful that there is a balance between keeping a community in check and in creating inclusion.","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T15:56:57.00813658Z","tags":null},"/Resource-Notes/Check-Your-Pulse-Newsletter":{"title":"Check Your Pulse (Newsletter)","content":"## Information\n- **Source:** [[Sari Azout]]\n- **Tags:** #technology #venturecapital #innovation  \n- **Notes:** [[Literature Notes/Check Your Pulse - Literature Notes]]","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T15:56:57.00813658Z","tags":null},"/Resource-Notes/Computers-and-Creativity-Thesis":{"title":"Computers and Creativity - Thesis","content":"## Information\n- **Source:** [[Molly Mielke]]; https://www.mollymielke.com/cc#mold\n- **Tags:** #creativity #innovation #technology \n- **Notes:** \n\n## Highlights\n\u003e to foster optimal human innovation, digital creative tools need to be interoperable, moldable, efficient, and community-driven.\n\n\u003e Interoperable, moldable, efficient, and community-driven digital creative tools hold immeasurable potential as ==co-creators with human beings.== Tools of this type would ==lower the barrier to entry== and ==make all users toolmakers and owners== in an expanded definition of technological innovation.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T15:56:57.00813658Z","tags":null},"/Resource-Notes/Content-Services-and-Asset-Businesses-in-the-Metaverse-Essay":{"title":"Content, Services, and Asset Businesses in the Metaverse - Essay","content":"## Information\n- **Source:** [[Matthew Ball]]; https://www.matthewball.vc/all/csametaverse\n- **Tags:** #metaverse #content #business \n- **Notes:** \n\n## Highlights\n\n\u003e The Metaverse will also revolutionize categories which, for the most part, have ==avoided disruption throughout the internet era. ==Education is a great example.

Instead, the Metaverse will enable students to learn about the construction of Roman aqueducts by helping to build them. Rather than just reading about physics, children will build [Rube Goldberg machines](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/lesson-plans/create-a-rube-goldberg-machine-in-fortnite-creative) (on Earth, and on Mars), and construct LED screens the size of buildings. None of this requires education at a distance, but it certainly improves it.

E. B. Du Bois, The Talented Tenth‚Äù\n\n\u003e approaches communities not as (solely) consumers, test subjects, ‚Äútest beds,‚Äù or objects of study, but instead imagines them as co-designers and coauthors of shared knowledge, technologies, narratives, and social practices\n\n\u003e ‚Äúpedagogies of design justice must be based firmly upon the broader approach known as popular education (educaci√≥n popular, in Spanish), or pop ed, as it is often called by practitioners in the United States.‚Äù\n\n\u003e ‚Äúbanking model of education, in which an educator, positioned as the expert, attempts to deposit knowledge in the mind of their students.‚Äù\n\n\u003e ‚Äúhe encourages critical pedagogy, where the role of the educator is to pose problems, create spaces for the collective development of critical consciousness, help to develop plans for action to make the world a better place, and develop a sense of agency among learners.‚Äù\n\n\u003e ‚ÄúFreire focuses on developing critical thought together with action, in a cycle he refers to as praxis, a Greek term originally referring to ‚Äúpractical knowledge for action.‚Äù7 Freire defines it as ‚Äúreflection and action upon the world in order to transform it.‚Äù\n\n\u003e ‚Äúthe goal of education is to transform oppressed individuals into subjects who engage in collective action to transform their conditions of oppression.‚Äù\n\nKey Principles of Pop Ed:\n1. Education is never neutral\n2. Relevance\n3. Problem-posing\n4. Dialogue\n5. Praxis\n6. Transformation\n\n\u003e ‚ÄúInstead of being used as a tool to divide and conquer, we believe technology must be taken back by the people and used as a tool of liberation.‚Äù\n\n\u003e ‚Äúcritical community technology pedagogy, an approach that ‚Äúdemystifies systemic power inequalities, involves a multi-directional learning process, results in transferable skills, and constructs a new world as it constructs knowledge.‚Äù\n\n\u003e ‚Äúconstructionism. Although not explicit about race, class, gender, or disability politics, this is a pedagogical approach that centers context, situated knowledge, and learning by doing.‚Äù\n\n\u003e ‚Äúfor Piaget, learning is experiential: it takes place through an active process where the learner develops the ability to modify or transform an object or idea.‚Äù\n\n\u003e ‚Äúconstructionism‚Äôs two central concepts: first, that learning is a reconstruction, rather than a transmission, of knowledge; second, that ‚Äúlearning is most effective when part of an activity the learner experiences as constructing a meaningful product.‚Äù\n\n\u003e ‚Äúteachers act as facilitators to help students achieve their own learning goals using problem-based learning.‚Äù\n\n\u003e ‚ÄúProblem-based learning works best when problems are part of larger, ideally real-world tasks; learners are supported to take ownership of the problem; the task is appropriate to the learner‚Äôs level of understanding and ability; the learner must reflect on what is being learned and how they learned it; and the educator encourages the learner to test their ideas in various contexts.‚Äù\n\n\u003e ‚ÄúWe need to expand the notion of ‚Äòdigital fluency‚Äô to include designing and creating, not just browsing and interacting.‚Äù\n\n\u003e ‚Äútechnological fluency, or young people‚Äôs ability to fully incorporate computers and digital technology into their own creative practices.‚Äù\n\n\u003e ‚ÄúFrom this experience, Resnick describes four principles for technology educators: support learning through design experiences, help youth build upon their own interests, cultivate ‚Äúemergent community,‚Äù and create an environment of respect and trust.‚Äù\n\n\u003e ‚ÄúResnick summarizes the core of constructionism in the following two principles: first, ‚Äúpeople do not get ideas, they make them.‚Äù Second, ‚Äúpeople construct new knowledge with particular effectiveness when they are engaged in constructing personally meaningful products.‚Äù\n\n\u003e ‚ÄúDecolonizing design involves decentering Western approaches to design pedagogy, while centering design approaches, histories, theories, and practices rooted in indigenous communities.‚Äù\n\n\u003e ‚Äúdesign is no less than the conception and planning of the artificial world. Its products include objects, processes, systems, and environments; in short, everything.‚Äù\n\n\u003e ‚ÄúEducators, hooks argues, must recognize ourselves as embodied subjects in the classroom, rather than pretend that we speak from a disembodied place.‚Äù\n\nDesign Justice Network Principles\n1. ‚ÄúWe Use Design to Sustain, Heal, and Empower Our Communities, as Well as to Seek Liberation from Exploitative and Oppressive Systems‚Äù\n2. ‚ÄúWe Center the Voices of Those Who Are Directly Impacted by the Outcomes of the Design Process‚Äù\n3. ‚ÄúWe Prioritize Design‚Äôs Impact on the Community Over the Intentions of the Designer‚Äù\n4. ‚ÄúWe View Change as Emergent from an Accountable, Accessible, and Collaborative Process, Rather than as a Point at the End of a Process‚Äù\n5. ‚ÄúWe See the Role of the Designer as a Facilitator Rather than an Expert‚Äù\n6. ‚ÄúWe Believe that Everyone Is an Expert Based on Their Own Lived Experience and that We All Have Unique and Brilliant Contributions to Bring to a Design Process‚Äù\n7. ‚ÄúWe Share Design Knowledge and Tools with Our Communities‚Äù\n8. ‚ÄúWe Work toward Sustainable, Community-Led, and Controlled Outcomes‚Äù\n9. ‚ÄúWe Work toward Nonexploitative Solutions that Reconnect Us to the Earth and to Each Other‚Äù\n10. ‚ÄúBefore Seeking New Design Solutions, We Look for What Is Already Working at the Community Level, and We Honor and Uplift Traditional, Indigenous, and Local Knowledge and Practices‚Äù\n\n\u003e ‚ÄúLearning to Code as Liberatory World-Making, or ==Workplace Preparedness under Neoliberal Technoculture==?‚Äù\n\n\u003e ‚ÄúTeaching people how to code is increasingly presented as a key goal‚Äîperhaps the key goal‚Äîfor the education system under ==late-stage informational capitalism==.‚Äù\n\n\u003e ‚ÄúAt the same time, as sociologist Tressie McMillan Cottom documents in her book Lower Ed: The Troubling Rise of For-Profit Colleges in the New Economy, for-profit universities that promise to teach coding skills and secure jobs for their graduates proliferate both on and offline.93 Many of the most visible for-profit coding schools and boot camps are ==expensive, inaccessible, and have dubious placement outcomes.==94‚Äù\n\n\u003e ‚Äúdigital learning among young people remains ==structured== by race, class, and gender.‚Äù\n\n\u003e ‚ÄúIn a recent study of digital learning, education researchers Mimi Ito and Justin Reich find that, in many cases, digital learning technologies such as MOOCs and online courses, in-school computing classes, and other interventions ==actually exacerbate inequalities in learning outcomes== between low-income and wealthier students, between students of color and white students, and between male and female students. In addition, they note that the use of digital technology in education often ==unintentionally reproduces inequality==, in large part due to ‚Äúinstitutionalized and unconscious bias and social distance between developers and those they seek to serve.‚Äù\n\n\u003e ‚Äúlearning to code is increasingly taught in ways that emphasize diversity, creativity, and critical thinking.‚Äù\n\n\u003e ‚ÄúIs the ultimate object to make people good coders, or to make coders good people?‚Äù\n\n\u003e ‚Äúdesign pedagogies that promote critical thinking are not incompatible with the development of practical design skills.‚Äù\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T15:56:57.00813658Z","tags":null},"/Resource-Notes/Do-Design-Book":{"title":"Do Design - Book","content":"## Information\n- **Source:** [[Alan Moore]]\n- **Tags:** #nonfiction #design #philosophy\n- **Notes:** [[Literature Notes/Do Design - Literature Notes]]\n\n## Highlights\n- salve corpus amanti, literally translated as ‚Äòsave the lover‚Äôs body‚Äô.\n    - 2.

Currently, arguments around whether we will forever move away from urban centers, or we will only be working remotely, or we will hang out with friends only in VR, or we will be digitally exhausted demonstrate these qualities, where a few variables render a few versions of the reality.

They are pragmatists. They want to solve problems and make life as comfortable as possible. Material concerns predominate, and people can become quite individualistic.\n\t4.  ==Fourth generation:== feels that society has lost its vitality and begins to question the values they have inherited, some becoming quite cynical. A crisis of sorts emerges.\n- These narratives, despite being criticized as oversimplistic and borderline manipulative, are like ==prisms== through which we can gain the necessary ==understanding to act urgently in response to the environment.==\n- Product-zeitgeist fit: when a product ==resonates== with the mood of the times. These can be determined with the following tests:\n\t- ==\"Nerd Heat\":== When the most talented, hardest working, and most in-demand people‚Äîthe product managers, engineers, and data scientists‚Äîare so intrigued by a product that they're working on it, excited by it, and trying to make it a thing.\n\t- ==The \"Despite Test\":== When people are using a product despite the fact that it's not the best thing out there.\n\t- ==The \"T-shirt Test\":== If people with no connection to the company are wearing their t-shirts or putting their stickers on their laptops or wearing their socks, that desire to associate with the idea indicates as much a movement as a product.\n\t- ==The \"Eyebrow Test\":== In the early days, things that have product zeitgeist fit often feel misunderstood or controversial.

This is true of me, and it is true of each of you. And each of us, to a greater or lesser degree, is confronting a high, solid wall. The wall has a name: It is ==The System.== The System is supposed to protect us, but sometimes it takes on a life of its own, and then it begins to kill us and cause us to kill others - coldly, efficiently, systematically. I have only one reason to write novels, and that is to ==bring the dignity of the individual soul to the surface and shine a light upon it.== The purpose of a story is to sound an alarm, to keep a light trained on The System in order to prevent it from tangling our souls in its web and demeaning them. I fully believe it is the novelist's job to keep trying to clarify the uniqueness of each individual soul by writing stories - stories of life and death, stories of love, stories that make people cry and quake with fear and shake with laughter.

Everyone wants to live a life bigger than oneself, and one can do that the best when their natural strengths align with what the world needs the most. ==The best talent needs a new way to be discovered, validated, and utilized in a way that's not simply centered around brand signals and numeric metrics used by corporate employment.==\n- How to get ideas out aside from fitness: ==productive daydreaming/actionable visualization==\n\n### Vol. 19: this is between you and me\n- Why are emotions and sentiments exclusive to poetry and the arts, and why are impact and scale exclusive to technology and commerce?

You usually know you are working under a great leader when you feel propelled to become a ==better version of yourself==, as uncomfortable or stressful as the process may get.\n- Some questions that have worked magic for me:\n1.

The metaverse, a term coined by science-fiction novelist Neal Stephenson, refers to an all-encompassing 3-D digital space that resembles those of today‚Äôs massive multiplayer games.\n\n\u003e It may seem ironic that some educators see the solution to online learning loss as more online learning, but both Fleming and his students say the experience is different. ==Game design and other technology-related topics, they say, translate well to online spaces like Zoom.==\n\n\u003e ‚ÄúI was actually surprised at how much better it was than taking school online,‚Äù she said.

The problem is that it‚Äôs ==not sustainable==. While pointsification may help tweak some behaviors in the short term, it doesn‚Äôt work for long enough to build actual skills.\n\n### True Gamification\nAccording to Jane McGonigal, PhD game designer, a true game has 4 defining traits:\n1.  A **goal** or specific outcome that provides players with a sense of¬†_purpose_.\n2.  **Rules** that place limitations on¬†_how_¬†players can achieve the goal‚Äîthese are unnecessary obstacles that players choose to tackle with their whole heart.\n3.  A¬†**feedback system**¬†that tells players how close they are to achieving the goal‚Äîthis lets players know that the goal is definitely achievable and provides motivation to keep playing.\n4.  **Voluntary participation**. All players must know and willingly accept the goal, the rules, and the feedback‚Äîplayers should be able to enter or leave the game at will to ensure the experience is safe and pleasurable.\n\n\u003e In a true game, the player isn‚Äôt only motivated by a future prize or reward. The player in a true game chooses to play out of _genuine interest_. **If you stripped away the points and prizes, the game would still be attractive.**\n\n\u003e Players came away feeling they had truly accomplished something _they_ wanted. **The reward of the game tied into something these people genuinely desired.**\n\nHere are 3 questions to keep in mind next time you want to create a true game:\n1.  **Is the goal of the game centered around the player‚Äôs authentic interest and skill set?**¬†‚Äú_You're looking for the challenge that's going to really bring the best out in people and really, when they achieve it, they feel like it was a meaningful and epic achievement._‚Äù‚ÄîJane McGonigal\n2.  **Are there unnecessary obstacles that players voluntarily choose to tackle?** In golf, for example, players have to insert a tiny ball into a tiny hole from a far distance using a club. It‚Äôs the most inefficient way to place a ball in a hole, and that‚Äôs precisely what makes the game interesting.\n3.  **Is there a reliable feedback system with opportunities for failure and improvement?** How do players track their progress? Are there real skills involved that players can get better at and improve with practice? Or is it an arbitrary leaderboard they are trying to move up?\n\nThe trick to creating a true game is ==figuring out what your audience is interested in== and ==tapping into those genuine challenges or desires.== It‚Äôs about coming up with a challenge that‚Äôs so immersive it puts players in a [flow state](https://fs.blog/2013/07/what-makes-you-happy/).

After analyzing the interviews and coding them by theme, she distilled her findings into seven traits: ==self-awareness, empathy, willingness to play, curiousity, mindfulness, resilience, effective communication==\n\n#### Traits\n##### Self-Awareness\n\u003e _Dr. Anhalt‚Äôs definition: Emotionally fit leaders are self-reflective. They understand their triggers and biases and continuously check in with themselves. They are patient, resilient and willing to be vulnerable with others. They can tolerate frustration and manage their emotions. They understand that the feelings they have about others have a lot to do with their own selves._\n\nHow to work on this trait:\n- Start with yourself and see what you‚Äôre transferring.\n\u003e ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs an interesting psychological phenomenon that I‚Äôm seeing a lot of right now called institutional transference,‚Äù says Anhalt. ‚Äú[[Institutional transference]] happens ==when we put feelings about something other than work onto our place of work, or vice versa.‚Ä¨== And it‚Äôs especially intense right now. We have a lot of feelings ‚Äî and not a lot of control. We also feel guilt for complaining when others have it worse, so our emotions have nowhere to go. They get disguised as other, more acceptable issues. Fears about the future morph into concerns your team isn‚Äôt pushing hard enough. Your fights with your co-founder might be coming from something you have going on at home. And we have no idea that some of these feelings might be about something else entirely.‚Äù\n- Get to therapy, if you can ‚Äî especially if ‚Äúnothing‚Äôs wrong.‚Äù\n\n##### Empathy\n\u003e Dr. Anhalt‚Äôs definition: Emotionally fit leaders can (and do) put themselves in others‚Äô shoes on a regular basis. They recognize that what they feel about things might not necessarily be what others feel, and they strive for empathy even when it is difficult. Although they must sometimes make unilateral decisions, they consider how those decisions will affect others.\n\n- Tap into how your team is feeling\n- Remember to fill your reserves\n\n##### Willingness to play\n\u003e Dr. Anhalt‚Äôs definition: Emotionally fit leaders understand and encourage the importance of play. Play sparks spontaneity and creativity, and is a crucial part of emotional health and interpersonal cohesiveness. Playing means trying on thoughts or concepts to see how they feel. It means having a free exchange of ideas and meeting of the minds.\n\n\n##### Curiousity\n\u003e Dr. Anhalt‚Äôs definition: Emotionally fit leaders understand and tolerate the difference between what they want to be true and what is true, and they make it a habit to ask questions and be curious, even when the answers to those questions are uncomfortable.\n\n\u003e ‚ÄúThis might be unexpected, but I always tie this trait back to feedback,‚Äù says Anhalt. ‚ÄúCuriosity is often framed as this kind of solo quest. ‚ÄòI‚Äôm curious about this, so I'm going to research this and read that,‚Äô and so on. But I also think [[Curiosity is the best skill to counteract defensiveness]]. When someone comes to us with constructive feedback, often our first instinct is to defend ourselves or explain why they got it wrong. If instead we get curious and ask questions like, ‚ÄòTell me more about that?‚Äô or ‚ÄòWhat could I do differently next time?‚Äô ==we avoid this defensive reflex and open ourselves up to growth==.‚Äù\n\nTo solicit ongoing feedback and get a more thorough picture of what those around you are seeing, she suggests cultivating your ==listening skills.== Here are some tips that Anhalt has developed in her years working with clients as a therapist:\n- Remember that you don‚Äôt have to always use words to show you‚Äôre listening ‚Äî nods and facial expressions are often just as powerful.\n- Instead of focusing on what you‚Äôre going to say next, stay present in the conversation.\n- Allow for pauses and silence so the speaker can reflect on what they‚Äôre saying and expand upon it. The first thing a person says is often not what they really want you to know.\n- Don‚Äôt feel compelled to fix things or give advice right away. When in doubt, ask what the speaker needs ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs comfort, solutions or they‚Äôre just looking to vent.\n\n##### Mindfulness\n\u003e Dr. Anhalt‚Äôs definition: Emotionally fit leaders can sit with and process through discomfort. They are able to have tough conversations, be transparent about uncomfortable information, share complicated feedback and sit with a problem until it has been fully thought through.\n\n\u003e Anhalt likens strengthening mindfulness to how the practice of yoga involves holding your body and settling into poses that might feel uncomfortable in the moment. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre making a decision or taking an action purely to move away from discomfort, take a moment to reflect on whether the discomfort is really so intolerable. Sit with it for a while, take a deep breath and prove to yourself that you can handle it. You do not need to break every silence, fix every issue immediately or avoid difficult conversations,‚Äù she says.\n\nSelf-care is one of the first things to go when times get tough, but if you want to lead and help others through times of struggle, you need to put on your own oxygen mask first. Here are four specific tactics Anhalt recommends:\n- Reflect on one thing you‚Äôre too hard on yourself about. Forgive yourself.\n- Think of one small thing people could do to support you this week. Ask for it.\n- Write down what you appreciate about three people you love. Send it to them.\n- Schedule a ‚Äúworry hour.‚Äù Block off a slot on your calendar where you get to be as worried as you want for that amount of time.\n\n##### Resilience\n\u003e Dr. Anhalt‚Äôs definition: Emotionally fit leaders know that more is to be learned from failure than success, and can bounce back during trying times and can take in difficult feedback. Their desire to grow is genuinely greater than their desire to avoid criticism or failure. They are flexible and can adapt quickly.\n\n\n##### Effective Communication\n\u003e Dr. Anhalt‚Äôs definition: Emotionally fit leaders are able to put words to their needs and expectations. They are able to talk through issues in a proactive, ongoing way. They can balance flexibility with maintaining their authority and appropriate boundaries.\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T15:56:57.01213667Z","tags":null},"/Resource-Notes/In-Online-Ed-Content-Is-No-Longer-King-Cohorts-Are-Essay":{"title":"In Online Ed Content Is No Longer King - Cohorts Are - Essay","content":"## Information\n- **Source:** [[Wes Kao]]\n- **Tags:** #content #education \n- **Notes:**  [[Literature Notes/In Online Ed Content Is No Longer King - Cohorts Are - Literature Notes]]\n\n## Highlights\n\u003e post-content age\n\n\u003e educational content is cheap and abundant on YouTube, in newsletters, on blogs, and on social media.\n\n\u003eIn addition, dozens of accelerators, incubators, low-cost or free online courses, and alternative education programs have popped up to serve working professionals who want to learn.\n\n\u003e it‚Äôs become nearly impossible for instructors to break out ‚Äî let alone make a living ‚Äî off their expertise, [as they‚Äôve been told they can](https://a16z.com/2019/10/08/passion-economy/).\n\n\u003e most learners are actually _worse_ off for all this cheap, abundant content ‚Äî it‚Äôs become clear over the years that ==more access does not translate to more engagement.==\n\n\u003e Many of the online course providers that gained prominence in the aughts sold the pretense that customers could learn anything, but relied on the ==learners‚Äô willpower and motivation== to stick through a course. It‚Äôs a familiar pattern in other self-directed programs, too: Anyone can access a workout and diet plan, but very few actually stick with it long enough to see results.\n\u003e \n\u003e Similarly, MOOCs ‚Äî the massively open online courses that were popularized in the 2010s and continue in other modern forms today ‚Äî offer evergreen, on-demand, recorded videos, often with a defined syllabus program. But their completion rate, as has been widely reported, is just ==3 to 6 percent==\n\n\u003e The key difference between this phase of online ed and the MOOCs in the past decade? ==They are engaging and _real-time,_ not just self-paced, and involve community-driven, active learning, as opposed to solo, passive content consumption. ==Cohort-based courses have a fixed start and end date, enforcing the real-time aspect and creating a scarcity within the abundance of content out there, and are often taught live. It‚Äôs the equivalent of participating in a college discussion seminar ‚Äî taught by an expert in the field, unconstrained by geography or school rank ‚Äî as opposed to watching a static video. And, importantly, there‚Äôs a built-in social contract in the form of the cohort.\n\n### MOOCs v.s. CBCs: The shift from content to communities\n\n\u003e But while these platforms provided access to both creators and learners, they didn‚Äôt deliver on the promise of ==student transformation. ==\n\nReasons why this pledge was naive: \n+ **MOOCs are asynchronous and self-paced**.\n+ **MOOCs‚Äô low (or no) cost colors the perception of quality**.\n+ **MOOCs convey ‚Äúknowledge transfer,‚Äù but not necessarily higher-order skills**.\n\n\u003e MOOCs are great for subjects that are primarily ‚Äúknowledge transfer,‚Äù such as how to sort data in Excel or other such skills. But ==they‚Äôre not great for higher-order skills==‚Äîthose that require analysis, evaluation, synthesis, judgment, and creativity. Continuing with the Excel example, a higher-order version might involve how to segment the data strategically to look for patterns and arrive at a recommendation.\n\n\u003e To summarize: On many MOOC platforms, the dominant learning modality is ==passive content consumption==; there‚Äôs no interaction or real community; and there‚Äôs no time constraint. All this amounts to a tiny [percentage](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereknewton/2020/06/21/the-depressing-and-disheartening-news-about-moocs/?sh=60625de976ed) of learners who actually follow through.\n\n### The case for cohort-based courses\n\n![[Pasted image 20210723014812.png]]\n\n#### CBCs focus on active, hands-on learning\n\u003e Students have to put in more effort through this format; they‚Äôll stumble and make mistakes. While this is inarguably harder than listening to a charismatic ‚Äúsage on stage‚Äù lecturer ‚Äî where some students in the same study even perceived themselves to be [retaining more knowledge](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2019/09/study-shows-that-students-learn-more-when-taking-part-in-classrooms-that-employ-active-learning-strategies/) when taught by ‚Äúsuperstar lecturers‚Äù than they actually were ‚Äî the research showed students actually [learned more](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2019/09/study-shows-that-students-learn-more-when-taking-part-in-classrooms-that-employ-active-learning-strategies/) from the hands-on experience.\n\n![[Pasted image 20210723014948.png]]\n\n\u003e From the professional‚Äôs standpoint, cohort-based courses also bring the network benefits of startup accelerators to a wider market. ==The value in accelerators isn‚Äôt just content, it‚Äôs community.==\n\n#### Live, bi-directional learning leads to more accountability\n\n\u003e In his book [_Cooperative Learning_](https://www.amazon.ca/Kagan-Cooperative-Learning-Grades-450pp/dp/1879097109), the clinical psychologist and professor of psychology Spencer Kagan argues that the single most powerful approach to comprehension and retention is ==interactive processing, which occurs when ‚Äústudents engage in interaction with partners or teammates over the content.‚Äù== Part of the reason that this approach is so powerful is that classroom discussions and debates produce new ideas and points of view; that back-and-forth holds student attention in a way that no lecture can.\n\n\u003e Another reason cohort-based courses can have more accountability is that they are bi-directional, as opposed to one-way, meaning there‚Äôs an exchange of knowledge between the instructor and students, as well as students with fellow students. ==It‚Äôs a [dialogue, not a static lecture](https://www.weskao.com/blog/the-state-change-method).==\n\n![[Pasted image 20210723015209.png]]\n\n\u003e Studies also show that what psychologists and neuroscientists call ==‚Äúinterleaving‚Äù learning ‚Äî where instructors mix different topics, ideas, and activities together during study, forcing students to intentionally switch between them rather than focusing on a single subject ‚Äî can result in better learning outcomes for students.== A Brazilian jiu jitsu athlete, for instance, alternates practice between chokes, locks, escapes, and take-downs. Cohort-based courses are inherently about interleaving, giving students a chance to engage in different modalities ‚Äî breakouts, role-playing, discussions, debates ‚Äî with the instructor, coaches, and each other.\n\n#### Community building improves learning outcomes through social features\n\n\u003e When designing cohort-based courses, I also deeply researched institutions outside education ‚Äî [the military, dance-a-thons, Crossfit, and even cults ‚Äî to understand the motivation of groups.](https://twitter.com/wes_kao/status/1275825916325908481?s=20) All of these were ‚Äústicky‚Äù for their participants (for better or worse). But where most traditional education forces students to learn, it‚Äôs clear that continuing education and adult learning must be compelling and carrot-driven, not stick-driven.\n\n\u003e Why pay $750 to $5,000 for a cohort-based course when you can take a MOOC for $10 to 50?\n\n\u003e Cohort-based courses self-select for learners who are willing to (and can) pay a premium for the perceived quality of content and follow-through. Most learners likely need the accountability and urgency that comes from the time constraints of a live course (with a clear beginning and end date), and from learning with a peer group.\n\n#### A new model for creator monetization\n\n\u003e monetizing their expertise is really hard, especially if they don‚Äôt have existing followings or networks.\n\n\u003e traditional social platforms ‚Äî Instagram, TikTok, Twitter ‚Äî create a division between the activities intended to monetize and those meant for community building. Creators give away valuable content, but most don‚Äôt have the volume needed to make a living from advertising alone.\n\n\u003e Cohort-based courses provide a compelling way to monetize their expertise directly ‚Äî and without requiring volume. It may therefore be the next phase of creator monetization, not just for classic educators, as more ‚Äúknowledge‚Äù influencers run cohort-based courses. Cohort-based learning opens up a new quadrant of creator monetization:\n\n![[Pasted image 20210723020054.png]]\n\n+ **Instructors can make a healthy amount of money**\n+ **Creators get more leverage with a productized offering**\n+ **Consumers get more payoff, creators get higher monetization potential and scalability**","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T15:56:57.01213667Z","tags":null},"/Resource-Notes/Information-Architecture-Class":{"title":"Information Architecture - Class","content":"## Information\n- **Tags:** #design \n\n## Notes\n-  [[Miscellaneous Notes/Daily Notes/2020-09-15]]: Introduction to Information Architecture","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T15:56:57.01213667Z","tags":null},"/Resource-Notes/Interdisciplinary-Approaches-to-Creation-Innovation-Class":{"title":"Interdisciplinary Approaches to Creation \u0026 Innovation - Class","content":"\n## Information\n- **Tags:** #creativity  #innovation\n\n## Notes\n- [[Miscellaneous Notes/Daily Notes/2020-11-10]]: Creativity as Human\n- [[Miscellaneous Notes/Daily Notes/2020-12-18]]: Creativity as Revision\n- [[Miscellaneous Notes/Daily Notes/2021-01-05]]: Creativity as Resistance","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T15:56:57.01213667Z","tags":null},"/Resource-Notes/Is-the-Metaverse-Finally-Emerging-Essay":{"title":"Is the Metaverse Finally Emerging - Essay","content":"## Information\n- **Source:** [[Ray Schroeder]]; https://www.insidehighered.com/digital-learning/blogs/online-trending-now/metaverse-finally-emerging\n- **Tags:** #metaverse #education \n- **Notes:** \n\n## Highlights\n\u003e [Frey notes](https://futuristspeaker.com/future-trends/will-we-be-living-in-the-metaverse/) that there are technological challenges that must be overcome to facilitate growth. ‚ÄúFor example, there are the challenging issues of the ==internet infrastructure==, the feasibility of having ==large numbers of participants interacting with each other in real-time==, ==language barriers==, and ==latency issues==.‚Äù And, yet the rapidly expanding 5G wireless networks are quickly spreading coast to coast with extremely low latency and high bandwidth characteristics that can handle seamless virtual reality and augmented reality.

Will your institution be represented -- welcoming virtual students from around the real word to engage in 3-D learning around the clock?\n\nIdeas","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T15:56:57.01213667Z","tags":null},"/Resource-Notes/Its-time-to-build-A-New-Worlds-Fair-Essay":{"title":"Its time to build - A New Worlds Fair - Essay","content":"## Information\n- **Source:** [[Cameron Wise]]\n- **Tags:** #innovation\n- **Notes:** \n\n## Highlights\n\u003e While most have heard of the World's Fairs, few know how important they were in shaping our culture. Drawing more than 60 million guests in the 1960s alone, these 6-month long mega-events gave us a place to celebrate our achievements and experience the future up close and in person. ==They promoted a collective vision for a better world ‚Äî reminding us how connected we were and how far we could go if only we went together.==\n\n\u003e We now have the tools, resources, and means of coordination to reach heights that seemed impossible just four decades ago. Imagine the problems we could now solve and the feats we could achieve if we began to pursue a new, collective vision for the future.\n\n\u003e And to arrive at this vision, we must have a ==global conversation== about the world we want to live in. However, holding that conversation today is even harder than in the past. ==The digital dominance of the 21st Century has sorted us into our own tailored versions of online reality, where we drown in ads and information.== It's overwhelming, noisy, and ephemeral. It's hard to have a simple conversation, let alone align the globe on a future worth building.\n\n\u003e This is why we must look to the past ‚Äî to the World's Fairs ‚Äî to build the future.

We can take advantage of our existing digital infrastructure and the latest virtualization technologies to deliver ==a complementary experience that spreads the future to billions of people, allowing voices from all walks of life to participate in the conversation.== We can build a new World's Stage ‚Äî the intellectual equivalent of the Olympics ‚Äî where heroes and role models are created, where dreams are born, and where we celebrate achievement over superficial influence. We can build a new medium that keeps us pointed towards a North Star: helping us find our next great step, focus on it, and celebrate its achievement together.","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T15:56:57.01213667Z","tags":null},"/Resource-Notes/Kernel-Learn-Track-Module-0":{"title":"Kernel Learn Track - Module 0","content":"See [[Kernel MOC]]\n## The Play of Pattern\n#cognition #personaldevelopment \n**Goal:** learn framework that will help you think in transformative ways about Web3\n![[D301A621-0452-4A7E-BA2E-A26B5AB5BC62.jpeg]]\n\n+ **Pattern recognition is the core of cognition**\n\t+ best way to improve critical thinking\n+ Think in **complementary opposites**\n\t+ No to dualities like \"decentralization good, centralization bad\"\n\t+ There is no good without evil, no North without South, etc.\n\t+ This is known as **\"quantum thought\"**\n\t\t+ being able to contemplate both 0 and 1 simultaneously, along with the spectrum of probability  between\n\t\t+ no need to seek certanity\n\t\t+ This humbles us; coupled with wider perspective of total spectrum of possibilties, this can help us make more effective decisions\n+ Thus, we should have **humility**\n\t+ We can't be sure about the consequences of our actions\n\t+ We can only cultivate an acute observational awareness that can guide us towards making the right trade-offs\n### The Honest Question\nPeople who have **positively** changed the world did so because they negotiated complexity over imposing their own will\n\n\u003e üí° What is the question to which you are the universe's answer?\n\n\u003e üí° How can you respond most honestly, accurately, and lovingly?\n\n## Trust\n#crypto \n### Liars and cheats\n+ Bitcoin: **\"Don't trust, verify.\"**\n\t+ Trust is only meaningful where verification ends -\u003e fully understanding how people can lie\n\t+ Application\n\t\t+ we can codify the way in which it is possible to cheat \n\t\t+ we can also write executable software rules with deterministic results\n\t\t\t+ prevent cheating in protocols that we use to define and transfer value\n+ Demonstration of ==**complementary opposites**==\n\t+ To understand trust, you must know all possible deceptions\n\t+ Protocols with strong trust guarantees are built by defining and encoding what it means to lie\n\t+ Example of [clearly defined and encoded rules](https://github.com/jimmysong/programmingbitcoin/blob/master/ch07.asciidoc)\n+ This does not mean that we no longer need trust.

In 2004, the most common answer was \"zero\". We now have fewer friends across class, racial, economic, and political lines, because we have fewer friends -- period. And as you just discovered for yourself, **the fewer ==\"repeat interactions\"== there are, the more distrust will spread.** \n\n\u003e With a ==lower \"win-win\" reward==, **cheating** takes over. Game theory has two powerful ideas about this: \n\u003e **\"Zero-sum game\".** This is the sadly common belief that a gain for \"us\" must come at a loss to \"them\", and vice versa. \n\u003e **\"Non-zero-sum game\".** This is when people make the hard effort to create a win-win solution! (or at least, avoid a lose-lose) ==Without the non-zero-sum game, trust cannot evolve.== \n\n\u003e This is why ==\"miscommunication\"== is such an interesting barrier to trust: **a little bit of it leads to forgiveness, but too much and it leads to widespread distrust!** I think our modern media technology, as much as it's helped us increase communication... has increased our miscommunication much more. \n\nGame theory shows us the three things we need for the **evolution of trust**:\n1. Repeat interactions\n2. Possible win-wins\n3. Low miscommunication\n\n\u003e **What the game is, defines what the players do.**\nOur problem today isn't just that people are losing trust,\nit's that our *environment* acts against the evolution of trust. \n\u003e That may seem cynical or naive -- that we're \"merely\" products of our environment -- but as game theory reminds us, we are each others' environment. **In the short run, the game defines the players. But in the long run, it's us players who define the game.**\n\u003e So, do what you can do, to ==create the conditions necessary to evolve trust.== Build relationships. Find win-wins. Communicate clearly. Maybe then, we can stop firing at each other, get out of our own trenches, cross No Man's Land to come together...\n\nLearn to live and let live.\n\n#### Van Gogh\nhttps://www.brainpickings.org/2014/12/01/van-gogh-purpose-letter/\n\u003e ‚Äúit is not necessary to accept the choices handed down to you by life as you know it.‚Äù\n\n\u003e On the road that I‚Äôm on I must continue; if I do nothing, if I don‚Äôt study, if I don‚Äôt keep on trying, then I‚Äôm lost, then woe betide me.

But you must love with a high, serious intimate sympathy, with a will, with intelligence, and you must always seek to know more thoroughly, better, and more.\n\nLove is the only conduit to connecting with one‚Äôs purpose, with divinity itself\n\n\u003e There are idlers and idlers, who form a contrast.\n\u003e There‚Äôs the one who‚Äôs an **idler through laziness and weakness of character, through the baseness of his nature**‚Ä¶ Then **there‚Äôs the other idler, the idler truly despite himself, who is gnawed inwardly by a ==great desire for action==**, who does nothing because he finds it impossible to do anything since he‚Äôs imprisoned in something, so to speak, because he doesn‚Äôt have what he would need to be productive, because the inevitability of circumstances is reducing him to this point. Such a person doesn‚Äôt‚Äô always know himself what he could do, but he feels by instinct, I‚Äôm good for something, even so! I feel I have a ==raison d‚Äô√™tre==! I know that I could be a quite different man! For what then could I be of use, for what could I serve! There‚Äôs something within me, so what is it! That‚Äôs an entirely different idler.\n\n\u003e You know, what makes the prison disappear is very deep, serious attachment. To be friends, to be brothers, to love; that opens the prison through sovereign power, through a most powerful spell.

Based on complementary opposites, we can ask **\"What destroys value?\"**\n\t+ Some suggestions include: disagreement, fear, deception, violence, anger, envy, and inefficiency.\n\t+ In the same way that building trustless protocols means defining clearly what it means to cheat; we can come to understand far more about value by considering first what it is not.\n+ If it is not disagreement, fear, deception and envy, then it seems like **trust in clearly shared truths** lies at the core of ==how we might generate valuable interactions between people.==\n\n### Consensus\n+ So, how do we create shared truth? The simple answer is: **through fiction.**\n\t+ People tend to look down on fiction, even though it is really ==just the lie which reveals truth.==\n\t+ What matters most in terms of true value generation is the ==efficiency of the language you employ to tell your fiction.==\n+ The legal fiction of the firm resulted in orders of magnitude improvement in our **ability to generate value based on new kinds of transactions.**\n\t+ It has also ended up being extractive and corrupt, because legal text must be parsed and interpreted by humans, who are error-prone and easy to manipulate; and because legal text is - in fact - enforced by the threat of violence which relies on the asymmetric power of a nation state.\n+ **Blockchains implement a new kind of mathematical consensus fiction. **\n\t+ The core question remains: ==how many people can reliably share in the truth your fiction reveals, for this defines the constraints of what kinds of value can be generated with it.==\n\n### Narrative\n#society #sociology \n+ The development of human narratives\n\t+ Tribal narratives allowed truth to be shared between ~150 people. \n\t+ These evolved into religious myths around the time of the agricultural revolution. \n\t+ It's no coincidence that, concomitant with the spread of the first major religious myths, came the development of writing; the primary use of which was tracking debt. \n\t+ Myth alone is not enough to hold societies larger than your average tribe together: ==it needs to be paired with a shared record, built around succinct and significant symbols.==\n+ **Our ability to create value has always been tied to the ways in which we tell stories about, and with, our shared records.**\n\t+ However, prior to the feedback loop outlined in [trust](https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-0/trust), the record was maintained *by someone*, which gives them enormous power and means everyone else is incentivized to try and manipulate them.\n+ ==There is a whole new \"trust space\" we can explore==, searching for more valuable kinds of transactions impossible within merely legal fictions.\n\t+ Because blockchains allow us to define succinctly our shared truths\n\t+ and **because the record itself is shared** across all participants, \n+ Question: As opposed to the legal fiction of the firm, what is the fiction that reveals the truth underlying the value generated by blockchains?\n\t+ Mathematical consensus (extra points if you said \"cryptographically secure\").\n\n## Life is a work of art\n#personaldevelopment #life \n[Joyfully Subvert the Status Quo - May Li Khoe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aalyplbv5Mo)\nWhat does it actually *mean*?\n### How this fits into Kernel\n1. Where **meaning** stems from\n2. How we can design our own perceptions of the world to generate more meaning\n3. How we can create **value** both for ourselves and the communities of which we are a part\n\n### Brief\nMay Li begins by speaking about her mixed ancestry and the effect this has had on her approach to, and understanding of, value and meaning.\n\n\u003e \"Instead of thinking of life as a series of checks which I need to tick off - something which can be displayed on a graph that climbs ever up and to the right - ==I like to think of my life as a canvas which I can paint with whatever weird artwork I feel like== [...] Here is my mandatory Venn diagram: ==the status quo needs to change, and life is short.== When we put these two together, we can see that we need to subvert the status quo and have as much fun as possible along the way!\"\n\nThe point of meditation is not to get \"good\" at sitting around, thinking about nothing: ==it is to turn your life into a meditative one. Every act itself a meditation.== May Li talks about it in terms of turning the living of life into an artwork. The question is, what is the primary means we have a making art of our lives? This course will contend that it is *designing dialogue.*\n\n**In an empire of lies, telling the truth is a revolutionary act. In a fearful society; ==love and trust are the primary tools of resistance.==**\n\n==Play allows us to create and share ownership of spaces in ways which competition cannot.== This is why we have unicorns and dancing developers and silly memes: it's not something incidental. It is a fundamental part of what borderless, global history-writing based on consensus is about. The revolution is not being televised because it's not about hate or anger or violence or anything else that grabs the headlines of a media operating with skewed incentives. It's ==heart to heart==, here in the prison yards where we're using matching funds to build playgrounds where we can love again.\n\nTL;DR: **True play allows us to...** subvert the status quo. Have as much fun as possible along the way. Turn life into a canvas, rather than a graph with checkpoints. Welcome everyone. Eat great food. Enjoy dominoes again.\n\n### Small things\n\u003e ==\"When you do these little, joyful subversions remember that they can be really small. They don't have to be these grandiose events with hundreds or thousands of people.== When face-tracking came out, I managed to sneak little pink hearts into your Mac. At that time, there wasn't a lot of pink happening at all [laughs] It makes me happy to think I got Steve Jobs to approve this while pink hearts were coming out his head. Another example is the Technics 1200 turntables as your avatar - iconic in hip hop - and some other Easter eggs which are still in MacOS.\"\n\nMay Li goes on to talk about Scribble Together and her approach to presentation. One of the examples she uses is the ability to \"stamp multiple unicorns\". ==Everything is connected.==\n\n### Experiment with format\n\u003e \"Another thing you can do is experiment with format [...] For instance, using this traditional talk format to instead make everyone dance [...] Another one is subverting technology. This one is pretty profound. We talk a lot about the epidemic of loneliness [...] somehow, we have accepted the fact that computation has to be locked behind these little rectangles [...] ==How many years are we into the journey of computers and yet we still accept that we can get locked into things like this!?== What would happen if we turned computers inside out? There's an organization called DynamicLand which does exactly this. ==It's like cooking or scrapbooking; except it's all software and we're building things together.\"==\n\nIt's worth knowing a little bit about [Bret Victor](https://tinyurl.com/worriedream) and the work him and people like him are doing on computation as a concept and practice, rather than just writing more software in a linear, boxed-in kind of way. Stay with this until May Li makes it rain purple across everyone's prototypes with a Prince override. \n\n### Create a space\n\u003e \"Creating a space for change does not necessarily mean you're doing it yourself; ==you're just making it possible for others.==\"\n\nI once had a friend who told me, \"I'm not all that interested in Jesus, you know. I'm much more interested in what on earth was going on with that water he walked on!\" ==By which he meant that real miracles occur when you provide the environment for others to achieve seemingly miraculous things.==\n\n### Minding Symbolism\n\u003e \"When you think about dominant narrative and the status quo, symbolism is a big part of that, because ==a lot of how we relate to each other is through symbols and stories.==\"\n\n### Building on history\n\u003e \"I think change is rarely straightforward and, unlike the covers of magazines tend to show, it doesn't happen with one person on their own. ==We have a lot of room to build on history, to build on all the tremendous work of people before us who have striven for a better world.== One group of people who did something that was pretty important were the Black Panthers. One thing people don't realise about them is that they instituted a free breakfast program for children. We talk a lot about education and all the different statistics and projects there, but if people come to class hungry they cannot learn [...] This free breakfast program actually ended up being the blueprint for the Federal free breakfast program which happens today.\"\n\nMay Li uses this example to discuss the People's Kitchen Collective.\n\n\u003e \"These are recipes of resilience. ==The strength of our communities is, at its heart, based on the meals we share together.==\"\n\n**TL;DR: What are the five ways in which we can joyfully suvert the status quo?**\n1. Do small things.\n2. Experiment with format.\n3. Create space (not products!).\n4. Mind symbolism.\n5. Build on history.\n\n### Shifting the nature of work\n#edtech #work #culture #design \n\nThree keys to shifting the nature of work:\n\u003e \"I spent many years in conference rooms and, at some point in time after being at Apple for a little while, I felt like I wanted to do something a little different and I wound up joining Khan Academy. There were a couple of reasons I was attracted to it: one of them was that they are a not-for-profit which is building software, and that's pretty rare. I thought, 'hmmm, what would happen if our **incentive** structures were a little different?' I wanted to democratize learning too, so the **mission** was really profound for me. And the last thing was about the **culture**, because I felt that the organization was really open to some experimentation with cultural shifts.\n\n\u003e \"We wanted to shift educational software from assessing students and just asking 'Do you get it yet?' to letting them explore magical worlds themselves where, for instance, understanding the mathematics would give you powers [...] And all kinds of interesting stuff fell out of it: visual and interactive properties of prime numbers and so on.\n\n\u003e \"People tend to have a very vivid imagination when they work in design: you actually, literally, have the tools and you're constantly drawing possible futures. ==When you are iterating, you are literally drawing multiple possible futures.== So, if you take a second and think about something that you want to change, and you look around you - there are so many potential co-conspirators here! - this is really an invitation to you to make some friends and start some shit and joyfully subvert the status quo!\"\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T15:56:57.01213667Z","tags":null},"/Resource-Notes/Kernel-Learn-Track-Module-2":{"title":"Kernel Learn Track - Module 2","content":"See [[Kernel MOC]]\n## The Global Financial System\n\u003e We hope that you can already appreciate a little bit more deeply how to make meaning from the raw material of your life; not necessarily through grandiose action, but rather as the result of joyful little subversions along the way of real awareness and humility. ==A life lived wide awake naturally leads to various explorations of trust and value; the kinds of shared truth we preserve in narrative and pass between generations.== Now that we have ownerless, borderless protocols for recording such history, we can potentially multiply the effects of thousands of little individual subversions into a more stable, global joy.\n\n\u003e We'll begin with a short introduction to ==asking better questions==, because it really is worth asking about why systems are the way they currently are before moving straight into a disruptive mindset.

The most simple, seemingly silly questions are almost always the most profound.\n2. Good questions must come from a sincere desire to learn, rather than as a veiled means of stating your own opinion.\n3. Experts rarely ask good questions. Be a beginner, always.\n4. Questions are an opportunity to be humbled. Asking good questions is indistinguishable from *practicing humility.*\n5. Own up to what you don't know. It will set others free and you may end up coming closer to the shared truths which are a hallmark of honest conversation between peers.\n6. Close listening and clear attention are **preconditions** for good questions.\n7. A real master is the pupil in the eye of the world.

The debate boils down to whether asking good questions in general is an ability best developed through disciplined exercise of rational skill, or the cultivation of \"beginner's mind\". In particular, techniques like [the Socratic Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_method) develop rational inquiry in order to fuel deeper, more intuitive understanding of a given topic. Corey writes:\n\u003e ==Experience and reflection, learning from our mistakes, and developing understanding all provide nuance.== A mechanic doesn't develop his ability to diagnose a problem solely from introspection. It is through the combination of knowledge and understanding that intuition arises. I've spent most of my life honing skills that give me broad and deep understanding for the *specific purpose* of being able to ask good questions in any context.\n\nOr Justin B:\n\n\u003e I feel that ==knowledge of the specific==, e.g. computer science, translates directly into ==intuition around the general.==\n\nThe mechanic or scientist's skill does grow more nuanced through acquisition of knowledge and skill by the exercise of discipline, and this does lead to ==more specific questions about utility.== In this way, honing a skill leads to asking questions about that particular discipline, which is a good thing. So, let us add an 8th point:\n\n**8. Asking good questions requires a deep appreciation of context.**\n\nHowever, \"beginner's mind\" is not opposed to rational inquiry and the honing of skill: it is, in fact, the pinnacle of such discipline. Consider the Socratic method more closely:\n\n\u003e Socratic Circles are based upon the interaction of peers. The focus is to explore multiple perspectives on a given issue or topic. Socratic questions are open-ended, focusing on broad, general ideas rather than specific, factual information. ==The technique emphasizes a level of questioning and thinking where there is no single right answer.==\n\n+ Rational inquiry demands a diagnosis; a solution; an end to a process which had its beginning in the mind. \n\t+ What can such a mind do in the face of \"no single right answer\"? It can develop [negative capability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_capability), but even this is insufficient, because ==we're not after skillful intellectual understanding: we seek harmonious and clear ways of living.== And life is not only rational.\n+ Accepting honestly your own limitations and inability to understand everything that happens around you creates the space within for curiosity. \n\t+ You can genuinely enjoy never knowing what's going to happen next, which leads to asking questions which come from the heart and go to the heart of the subject being questioned.\n\t+  It is, as Paul Myburgh says, ==perceptual rather than conceptual: simple knowledge of things-as-they-are.==\n\n\n## Money and speech\n\u003e \"Put your money where your mouth is!\"\n\nA tamperproof, borderless, ownerless, global record is a new way of simultaneously ordering both which ==makes possible valuable==, ==meaningful communication== with anyone, anywhere in any way we care to program it. TL;DR: **a new kind of money and language.**\n\n### Magic internet meaning\n\n+ Our [narratives](https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-0/conversation) and [financial records](https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-1/value/#narrative) were clearly distinct before 2009\n\t+ But share common language from twin practices of [faith and finance](https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-1/playdough-protocols/#faith-and-finance)\n+ Money as a programmable protocol that relies on a **shared record** no-one owns is a development of the *order* of language\n\t+ Collapses distinction between ==narratives around which we organize== and ==our record of societal debt==\n+ Meaningful communication is a balance between the ==fact that your *ability* to speak ought to be free==, with the ==fact that you don't get to say whatever you please.==\n\t+ Freedom of speech enshrined as a constitutional good\n\t+ Implement error-handling for exceptions like hate speech and defamation\n+ Your ability to [access the network](https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-0/money-language/#open-protocols-and-a-network-of-value) (like TCP/IP) is free in all senses, ==requiring only a connection that can support you speaking in the same language as your peers. ==\n\t+ Protocols capable of processing valuable narratives (e.g. Bitcoin and Ehereum) render interperive balancing acts (negotiation, communication) unnecessary\n\t+ Saying anything *meaningful* (i.e. state-changing) has a specific, well-defined economic cost, captured in transaction fees which accrue to the benefit of those who \"listen\" to what you have to say.\n+ The **primary benefit** of this new order of econo-linguistic network we now communicate with: \n\t+ everyone is simultaneously free to speak \n\t+ the cost of any kind of meaningful speech is well-defined everywhere. \n+ We are also provided with a clear definition of meaning: ==any speech act which changes the state of our shared record.==\n\n### Regulation vs expense\n+ In blockchains, speech and execution are *one and the same thing* and interpretation is deterministic.\n+ Protocol has bare minimum of rules required for consensus\n\t+ You cannot double spend a token\n\t+ Every peer processes every transaction which passes these rules without fear or favor\n+ The context is determined not by legal interpretation, but by **economics.**\n\t+ Enshrining an ideal like \"free speech\" which we agree is good -\u003e certain behaviours we agree to be malicious are made prohibitively expensive\n\t+ They are not disallowed, just economically unsustainable, in much the same way that ==prevention is better than any cure.==\n\t+ Related: Vitalik's [Devcon 1](https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-1/understanding-ethereum/) talk\n+ [Programming penalties rather than rewards](https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-6/serenity/#proving-stake) ensures that the only state transitions worth validating are those that maintain a meaningful consensus. \n\t+ It is a profound change in ==how we regulate expression.==\n+ Complementary opposites: See [[Resource Notes/Kernel Learn Track - Module 0]]\n\u003e The most effective way to free meaning is to price it correctly.\n\n### Math beats bureaucracy\n+ Pricing different kinds of speech appropriately, rather than trying to \"protect\" a culturally-conditioned ideal, has the ==second-order cybernetic effect of better securing public goods. ==\n\t+ Cybernetics is a transdisciplinary and \"antidisciplinary\" approach concerned with regulatory and purposive systems‚Äîtheir structures, constraints, and possibilities. The core concept of the discipline is ==circular causality or feedback‚Äîthat is, where the outcomes of actions are taken as inputs for further action.==\n\t+ E.G. SSTOREs are a relatively expensive operation/expression because storing data on public networks is costly, and it is a cost borne by all of us.\n\t\t+ Thus, we agree upon a gas price that incentivizes developers to write contracts which store the minimum possible information required for state-changing, meaningful transactions.\n+ It could even be said that **there is no such thing as free speech** on freely accessible public blockchains\n+ Increasingly costly expression \u003c- increasingly complex kinds of meaning\n\t+ Incentives are programmed in such a way that the costs borne by the speaker are always provably more than those imposed on the community of listeners.\n\n### The expanded view\n+ The space of **meaningful communications** is greatly expanded when we stop \"protecting\" free speech\n\t+ price any speech act according to a ==set of explicit consensus rules== we all agree to follow\n+ We can **program** our shared ledger in any way we care to\n\t+ Favoring those in power = lack of creativity\n\t+ E.G. Gitcoin Grants and Quadratic Funding: a speech act which donates $1 to a cause can have nearly as great an effect as a donation two orders of magnitude larger, because we've [modelled clearly the most optimal way](https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-4/liberal-radical/#optimal-gathering) to fund public goods.\n\n\u003e When there is nothing to protect, we no longer need guards. Without guards, the digital world is not about captive audiences, but ==creative participation.==\n\n\n### Clarifying metaphors\nDespite the descriptive limitations of natural language faced with such a construction, we can still be precise about the exceptions to free speech \n1. **Hate speech** (analogous to malicious behaviour or outright attacks on the network) can be more elegantly handled when you are required to have [value-at-a-loss](https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-6/serenity/#a-defenders-game) to speak meaningfully.\n\t1. If you then violate rules which are not just social norms, but executable software, ==that value is slashed simultaneously with your speech== and you suffer provably more damage.\n2. **Defamation** comes in two flavours: *per se* (a statement that is obviously defamatory) and *per quod* (the defamatory implication must be proven).\n\t1. **Per se** defamation can be more elegantly handled by [mechanisms](https://our.status.im/discover-a-brave-new-curve/) like that which runs [dap.ps](https://dap.ps/). Anyone can vote in a way which \"defames\" a product or service, but that vote is also an economic signal denoted in tokens, which are sent straight back to the product or service. So, your downvote causes reputational damage while simultaneously repaying the people you're damaging (programmed according to a curve which makes votes cheaper the richer/higher the rank of whomever you're voting on is).\n\t2. **Per quod** defamation can be more elegantly handled either by some version of [negative votes](https://gitcoin.co/blog/gitcoin-grants-round-5-funding-our-future/) Gitcoin Grants is currently iterating over, or by reputational systems - hopefully [using profiles and actions](https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-4/self-enquiry/#identity-we-can-live-with) - yet to launch.\n3. The (in)famous [EIP-1559](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1559.md) is a great example of how we price transactional expression at the protocol level, which is where the most contentious [debates](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-2593.md) occur. Note, however, how such debate centres not on opinion, but engineering [trade-offs](https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-4/consensus/#1-lack-of-disagreement-is-more-important-than-agreement) and technical proof.\n\nThis new order of communication, akin to the appearance of language itself, is best demonstrated by:\n+ you need only memorize 12 magical **words**, incant them into an internet-connected machine and you gain immediate access to **monetary value**, anywhere in the world. \n+ One can even encode a reference to a newspaper headline in the genesis block of a network of timestamp servers (Satoshi's wording) which run money-as-a-protocol to make a permanent political statement. \n\n## Recollecting Our Origins\n[Shelling Out](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/shelling-out/)\n### How does this fit into Kernel?\n1. Reciprocal altruism and the problem of cooperation.\n2. The deep evolutionary links between **money**, mnemonics and genetic, generational memory.\n3. The importance of **incentive structures** to greater cooperation throughout human history.\n4. \nHow money has been used in situations of low **trust** to enable trade that would otherwise not have occurred.\n\n### Brief\n\u003e \"The precursors of money, along with language, enabled early modern humans to solve problems of cooperation that other animals cannot ‚Äì including ==problems of reciprocal altruism, kin altruism, and the mitigation of aggression.== These precursors shared with non-fiat currencies very specific characteristics ‚Äì they were not merely symbolic or decorative objects.\"\n\nSzabo begins with a story about the problems faced by the early colonists of America, who had limited access to the \"coin of the realm\", which was used to ensure they remained loyal subjects of the crown. They solved this by adopting the form of money used by the majority of Native Americans: wampum (or clam) shells. This strategy was so successful, and trade in wampum so widely accepted, that wampum became legal tender in New England from 1637 to 1661. Eventually the British shipped more coins to America and this practice ceased.\n\nThe language of money takes us back to well before recorded history, right to the very roots of homo sapiens sapiens, the wise ape capable of complex communication and its concomitant: ==the calculation of value.==\n\nThe precursors to money as we know it were used by people across the world to solve problems of **cooperation** in situations of low **trust**.\n\n### Reciprocal altruism\nThese strings of regular shells and other items may also have been used to satisfy our aesthetic tastes - made for sheer enjoyment. Far from an explanation, this raises a problem for evolutionary psychologists: why do people find the collection and wearing of jewelry enjoyable? What caused this pleasure to evolve? The critical question in all the theory is: **how did cooperative strategies evolve?**\n\n\u003e \"We will see that some humans, too, chose highly risky and discontinuous prey items, and shared the resulting surpluses with non-kin. Indeed, they accomplished this to a far greater extent than the vampire bat [...] Dawkins suggests, **\"money is a formal token of ==delayed reciprocal altruism==\"**, but then pursues this fascinating idea no further. We will.\"\n\nWe've established through Antonopoulos that [money is a language](https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-0/money-language) for communicating value, and that it was used long before writing was developed. This is now pushing to the heart of why language itself is useful at the biological, genetic level of our evolution: it fosters cooperation. In more technical terms, it allows us to overcome the value measurement problem - i.e. if you scratch my back in return for a piece of fruit, how long must you scratch for; how many ticks should you find; how big must the piece of fruit be; how do we remember who owes what in the case of delayed reciprocity? The cognitive overhead implied by this problem has never been overcome, except by *homo sapiens.*\n\n\u003e \"If clams can be money, furs can be money, gold can be money, and so on ‚Äì if money is not just coins or notes issued by a government under legal tender laws, but rather can be a wide variety of objects ‚Äì then just what is money anyway?\"\n\n\nMoney as a formal token of delayed reciprocal altruism, as an abstraction, and as a language has allowed human beings to overcome **==the value measurement problem.==**\n\n\u003e \"With money, there are only **n** prices ‚Äì 500 products, 500 prices. Money for this purpose can work either as a medium of exchange or simply as a standard of value ‚Äì as long as the number of money prices themselves do not grow too large to memorize or change too often.\"\n\nSzabo goes on to define early forms of money like wampum shells as \"collectibles\" and uses this to illustrate why \"people, clans or tribes trade voluntarily: because ==both sides believe they gain something.==\" Trade benefits from ==lowered transaction costs==, which are exactly where collectibles serve usefully, apart from their aesthetic or sentimental value. He describes:\n\n\u003e \"==how collectibles lowered transaction costs in each kind of wealth transfer== ‚Äì in the voluntary free gift of inheritance, in voluntary mutual trade or marriage, and in the involuntary transfers of legal judgments and tribute [...] Durable collectibles, what today we would call heirlooms, could persist for many generations and added substantial value at each transfer ‚Äì often making the transfer even possible at all.\"\n\n\u003e \"The Kula valuables doubled as \"high power\" money and **mnemonic for stories and gossip.** Many of the goods traded, mostly agricultural products, were available in different seasons, and so could not be traded in kind. Kula collectibles solved this ==double-coincidence problem== as an unforgeabaly costly, wearable (for security), and circulated (literally!) money. Necklaces circulated clockwise, and armshells counter-clockwise, in a very regular pattern.\"\n\n\u003e üí° ==Communicating value and transferring it are one and the same thing==; it's just that media which are not perfect abstractions - which have their own, intrinsic value - obfuscate this essential fact.\n\nThe primary benefit of using collectibles, with embedded narratives, as money is **lowered transaction costs.**\n\n### Communicative Wealth\nIn analyzing such wealth transfers, we need to keep two things in mind: ==**context**== (the time it occurs at and the supply/demand at that moment) as well as what Szabo calls the ==\"flow graph of monetary circulation\"== which allows collectibles to accrue value over time. E.G. Food is worth much more to starving people than to well-fed ones.\n\nHowever, the trust required to make the requisite trades was often lacking between tribes, and so ==collectibles substituted for otherwise necessary but non-existent long-term trust relationships. ==\n\nIn tandem with this kind of \"starvation insurance\", Szabo advances a ==theory of trade-based predation== - pointing out that many paleolithic tribes specialized in hunting only one kind of species, which often migrated seasonally, i.e. reindeer or bison. Importantly:\n\u003e \"It is not enough, for the theory of collectibles put forth in this paper to be correct, that single beneficial trades were possible. We must identify ==closed loops of mutually beneficial trades.== With closed loops the collectibles continue to circulate, amortizing their costs.\"\n\nCollectibles are not only useful for starvation insurance: they can be used to ==trade abstract foraging rights==, as is still the case with !Kung in Southern Africa today.¬†\n\nNevertheless the major point remains that underneath our great economic institutions are far more ancient institutions that also involved **wealth transfer.** Most importantly, this kind of transfer can be **passed between generations**: i.e. kin altruism beyond the grave.\n\n\u003e \"The ==demand for a durable and general store of wealth== for use in marriage, inheritance, dispute resolution, and tribute was thus even more urgent than for trade itself. Furthermore, these institutions may predate inter-tribal trade, and involved for most tribes a greater transfer of wealth than trade. ==These institutions, more than trade, served as the motivator and incubator of the earliest primitive money.\"==\n\nThis is a contentious argument, but the point remains that collectibles act as a ==container for memory== across generations, and our memories of who we are and what we owe extend far beyond mere trade relationships.\n\nIn order to achieve the lower transaction costs Szabo claims are a feature of money-as-collectibles, the collectibles must move in **closed loops** of mutually beneficial trade?\n\n### Mnemonics\n\u003e \"Often collectibles not only embodied wealth, but also served as a mnemonic, representing the title to a clan position of responsibility and privilege.\"\n\nThis has always been true, and in an even deeper sense that Szabo is getting at here. ==Wealth is itself a mnemonic==, perfectly illustrated by the fact that you now need only remember a 12 word mnemonic, which you can carry in your mind across any border in the world, in order to have immediate access to wealth. Szabo then discusses gifts and other forms of wealth transfer like family trade and marriage, putting particular emphasis on this notion of the closed loop of circulating collectibles, as well as tribute and the spoils of war. Again, when paying tribute:\n\n\u003e \"Collectibles doubled as a primitive mnemonic device that, while not verbatim, could be used as an aid to recall the terms of the [treaty](https://kernel.community/en/conversation).\"\n\nCirculating collectibles **highlight the link between money, language, mnemonics, and memory** (both individual and collective). ==Money contains the memories of our indebtedness to each other; narrative contains the memories of our indebtedness to life, the universe and everything.== What happens now that the two are merging?\n\nAnother critical point that comes up in the section on Spoils of War is that ==tribes would often hide wealth in order to reduce the tribute they were forced to pay.== This remains true today, albeit it in a more complex way. There is a very good reason we use the words \"shell corporation\". The innovation of a public, auditable, verifiable ledger changes this fundamentally, with hard-to-predict effects.\n\n### Taxes and coins\nSzabo uses these sneaky tribal tactics as a segue into the work of Arthur Laffer, who proved that ==as the tax rate increases, the amount of revenue increases, but at an increasingly slower rate than the tax rate,== due to increased avoidance, evasion, and - most of all - disincentive to engage in the taxed activity. This has become known as the ==Laffer Curve==:\n\n\u003e \"On a larger scale, the Laffer curve may be the most important economic law of political history. Charles Adams uses it to explain the rise and fall of empires. The most successful governments have been implicitly guided by their own incentives ‚Äì both their short-term desire for revenue and their long-term success against other governments ‚Äì to optimize their revenues according to the Laffer Curve. Governments that overburdened their taxpayers, such as the Soviet Union and later Roman Empire, ended up on the dust-heap of history, while governments that collected below the optimum were often conquered by their better-funded neighbors.\"\n\nThe main question about coins is why minting was dominated by governments as opposed to private interests - and the answer is not just the government's ability to enforce anti-counterfeit measures more effectively. It has to do with the fact that ==coins are high velocity money, facilitating a large number of low value trades.==\n\n\u003e \"The king, deriving his revenue from tax collection, had a strong incentive to measure the value of wealth held and exchanged by his subjects more accurately. That the exchange also benefited from cheaper measurement by traders of the medium of exchange, creating something closer to efficient markets, and allowing individuals to enter into the marketplace on a larger scale for the first time, was for the king a fortuitous side effect.\"\n\nBeing from the internet, we reject kings, presidents and voting; opting rather for rough consensus and running code. The question is ==whether we can have efficient marketplaces without central authorities such that the fortuitous side effects of global trade can accrue to the people actually trading, rather than the authorities \"allowing\" that trade to occur.==\n\nMoney helps humans solve the value measurement problem. Coins, as high velocity money, enable us to do this more efficiently. Traders in coins benefit, because measurement is **cheaper.**\nTake a moment to reflect on the cybernetic fact that ==money is about value measurement, and that measurement itself has a cost.==\n\n### Resolution\nHuman relationships of any kind generally require some kind of ==dispute resolution mechanisms== in order to be sustainable in the long term. Szabo tackles this thorny issue next:\n\u003e \"Most pre-modern cultures, ranging from the Iriquois in America to the pre-Christian Germanic peoples, decided that payment was better than punishment.\"\n\nThere is a lot more to be said about dispute resolution, but we selected this particular quote because it highlights a fundamentally important idea for Web 3: **can we advance the aims of rehabilitative justice using a shared and common historical record?** Because it's the perfect tool to do so. We can use economics to combat economic evils like the privatization of prisons. These are the kind of society-level changes we want you to think about, because they are, in principle, possible.\n\nThis takes us back to the primary importance of understanding this notion of collectibles:\n\u003e \"Indeed, collectibles provided a fundamental improvement to the workings of **reciprocal altruism**, allowing humans to cooperate in ways unavailable to other species. For them, ==reciprocal altruism is severely limited by unreliable memory.== Some other species have large brains, build their own homes, or make and use tools. No other species has produced such an improvement to the workings of reciprocal altruism. The evidence indicates this new development had matured by 40,000 B.P.\"\n\nSzabo goes on to discuss the properties of such collectibles and gives multiple examples of their development through history, basically linking up everything above. Importantly, he makes the point in the context of all this history, that\n\n\u003e \"A novelty of the 20th century was the issue of fiat currencies by governments. While generally excellent as a media of exchange, ==fiat currencies have proven to be very poor stores of value [due mainly to inflation].==\"\n\nIt's fascinating to consider the money we use today as a novelty, rather than a given. In any case, we then arrive at the conclusion:\n\n1. Collectibles were crucial in ==lowering transaction costs== such that our ancestors could trade between tribes and not just with kin, without succumbing to either the value measurement problem or the prisoner's dilemma.\n2. Collectibles entirely ==replaced reputation as the enforcer of reciprocation==, although violence still played a major role in enforcing rights as well as being a high transaction cost that prevented most kinds of trade.\n3. To be useful as a general-purpose store of wealth and means of wealth transfer, a collectible had to ==have certain functional properties and be embedded in at least one institution with a closed-loop cycle==, so that the cost of discovering and/or manufacturing the object was amortized over multiple transactions.\n4. With its ==unprecedented technology of cooperation==, humans have become the most fearsome predator ever seen on the planet.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T15:56:57.01213667Z","tags":null},"/Resource-Notes/Kernel-Learn-Track-Module-3":{"title":"Kernel Learn Track - Module 3","content":"See [[Kernel MOC]]\n## Take Back the Web\n+ Why did the initial visions for the world wide web not work out quite as their inventors intended?

Augmenting our ability to think for ourselves\n2. Reclaiming our time\n3. Extending our ability to co-operate\n\nTo establish our first pillar, we'll mix a [Vannevar Bush essay from 1945](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/) and a [2019 essay from Andy Matuschak and Michael Nielsen](https://numinous.productions/ttft/)\n\n### How does this fit into Kernel?\n+ Meaning of take back the web: \n\t+ the internet came with grand dreams\n\t+ though we're mostly stuck with artificial social spaces, overwhelming algorithms, and extractive **incentives** which are mining our attention as a means of propping up a failing economy.\n+ These two essays draw out a common thread of thought stretched across 74 years in order to illustrate what sorts of **freedom** are actually on offer in this world wide web of ours. \n\t+ Since 1945, one critical feature has revolved around ==constructing new media for free and creative thought.==\n\t+ At first it may seem unrelated to blockchains, but ==tools for thought are public goods and suffer from the same problem of incentives as all other public goods. ==\n\t+ They are thus the perfect example of common patterns for humanity which require us to understand why programming regenerative incentives matters, and what economic code can really be used to achieve in the long-term.\n\n\u003e \"The inheritance from the master becomes, not only his additions to the world's record, but for his disciples the entire scaffolding by which they were erected.\"\n\n### Brief\nVannevar Bush's essay begins as a plea for **cooperation** between scientists so as to make the shared record of human knowledge more **accessible.**\n\u003e \"The scientists, burying their old professional competition in the demand of a common cause, have shared greatly and learned much. It has been exhilarating to work in effective partnership [...] They have been part of a great team. Now, as peace approaches, one asks where they will find objectives worthy of their best.\"\n\n### Free yourself to work together\n\u003e \"There is a growing mountain of research [but we] cannot find time to grasp, much less to remember, all the conclusions of others as they appear. Yet specialization becomes increasingly necessary for progress, and the effort to bridge between disciplines is correspondingly superficial [...]\n\n\u003e \"The difficulty seems to be, not so much that we publish unduly in view of the extent and variety of present day interests, but rather that **publication has been extended far beyond our present ability to make real use of the record.**\"\n\nWe discussed how the record we use for establishing our shared history and for recording our transactions became [one and the same thing](https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-2/money-speech/#magic-internet-meaning) in 2009, but we have yet to attend to this central question: *how can we best use it?*\n\n\u003e \"A record if it is to be useful to science, must be **continuously extended**, it must be **stored**, and above all it must be **consulted.**\"\n\nSection 4: \n\u003e \"[Our technology must allow users] to **free their brains** for something more than repetitive detailed transformations in accordance with established rules [...] A mathematician is not one who can readily manipulate figures [...] S/he is primarily an individual who is skilled in the use of symbolic logic on a high plane, capable of intuitive judgment in the choice of the manipulative processes employed.\"\n\nSection 5 begins with the manipulation of logical processes beyond arithmetic and then dives into the final and most critical part the human record: **consultation.**\n\n### Selecting the trail\n\u003e \"We can enormously extend the record; yet even in its present bulk we can hardly consult it. This [...] involves the entire process by which man profits by his inheritance of acquired knowledge. The prime action of use is **selection**, and here we are halting indeed [...] Our ineptitude in getting at the record is largely caused by the artificiality of systems of indexing.\n\n\u003e \"[Instead of alphanumeric indices] the human mind [...] operates by ==association==. With one item in its grasp, it snaps instantly to the next that is suggested by the association of thoughts, in accordance with some intricate web of trails carried by the cells of the brain.\"\n\nBush introduces the ==\"memex\"== - a supplement to memory which pulls together microfilm, recording technologies, and associative selection. It won't be as fast or flexible as the brain, but it could at least improve the clarity and permanence of our recall.\n\n\u003e \"This is the essential feature of the memex. The process of tying two items together is the important thing [...] Thereafter, at any time, when one of these items is in view, the other can be instantly recalled merely by tapping a button below the corresponding code space.\"\n\nBush is really talking about ==building \"user trails\" through these associative indices.== In much the same way that one book is the associative trail of a mind moving through and selecting certain information; Bush has designed a machine to build trails of trails. These trails ==could also be shared:== my trail passed into your memex and vice versa - a far more efficient and less lossy means of collaboration than simply recommending a book or two.\n\n\u003e \"Wholly new forms of encyclopedias will appear, ready made with a mesh of associative trails running through them, ready to be dropped into the memex and there amplified [...] There is a new profession of trail blazers, those who find delight in the task of establishing useful trails through the enormous mass of the common record.\"\n\nBush then spends some time speculating on technologies which directly manipulate the human nervous system. He ends with this:\n\n\u003e \"[Science] may yet allow us truly to encompass the great record and to grow in wisdom. We may perish in conflict before we learn to wield that record for our true good. Yet, in the application of science to our needs and desires, it would seem to be a singularly unfortunate stage at which to terminate the process, or to lose hope as to the outcome.\"\n\nThe most critical aspect of useful shared records, and the one we are worst at is **consultation**. This requires that we improve at **selection** when working with information.\n\n### The mnemonic medium\n==Media for thought are all around us==: Bush cites the abacus which, through the positional display of number relationships it implies, led the Arabs to the concept of 0. ==Media for thought create powerful immersive contexts in which to explore new classes of ideas which were formerly impossible.== Matuschak and Nielsen take this much, much further.\n\n\u003e üí° If our media help us remember what matters, we may find our minds are already free.\n\n\u003e \"Alan Kay summed up the optimism of this dream when he wrote of the potential of the personal computer: 'the very use of it would actually change the thought patterns of an entire civilization' [...] for better and worse, computers have affected the thought patterns of our civilization over the past 60 years, and those changes seem like just the beginning.\"\n\nMedia for thought, like the abacus - or like money and writing - create ==powerful immersive contexts== (which can change the ==thought patterns== of civilizations).\n\nLeveraging the insights of cognitive science, we can create media that make it effortless to remember what you've read. The medium builds in the key steps involved in memory. In this context, it means adopting ==highly specialized flash cards== in an essay, and ==spaced repetition (SRM) reminders== after reading. These may sound trivial, but it takes advantage of a fundamental fact about human memory: ==as we are repeatedly tested on a question, our memory of the answer gets stronger, and we are likely to retain it for longer.==\n\nWhy all this focus on memory, though? Will building mnemonic media really free our thought? Remember, Bush showed how new media free our brains from rote tasks: mathematicians are not calculators, but people skilled at intuitively grasping higher order logic.\n\n\u003e \"Memory systems can be extraordinarily helpful for mastering abstract, conceptual knowledge [...] **because of the way the mnemonic medium embeds spaced repetition inside a narrative.** That narrative embedding makes it possible for context and understanding to build up.\"\n\nThe key in all this is how you craft the cards: the idea being to make a ==scalable *memory laboratory*== which can answer some very deep questions about human memory, how it might be improved and practiced, and what impact it can have on our thought and learning.\n\n\u003e \"We‚Äôll see that memory systems are a small part of a much bigger picture [...] Seriously developing memory systems is likely to lead to one or more transformative tools for thought.\"\n\n### Network structures for knowledge\n\nCritically, memory systems need to ensure that people don't just learn surface features; they need to help users in innovative ways when they do forget; and they need to encode stories into the mnemonic medium. In this sense, you can see the mnemonic media as ==carrying two texts: the actual one and the reflected one==, built up by all the knowledge encoded in cards.\n\nHowever, it is a mistake to think \"good memory system == spaced repetition\". There is also ==elaborative encoding== and the sort of ==associative trail==s Bush was talking about; and techniques like [the method of loci](https://www.ourmachine.net/writing/memory-i/), though this isn't as useful for remembering abstract, conceptual knowledge. Seeing this broader perspective allows us to ask much deeper questions, like:\n\n\u003e üí° What is the ideal network structure of knowledge?\n\nAnd what does memory have to do with *understanding* and *creativity*?\n\nConceptual mastery and creativity is actually enabled by a mastery of details. By largely automating away the problem of memory, ==the mnemonic medium makes it easier for people to spend more time focusing on other parts of learning, making the awkward early stages easier to get through.== The link between memory and mastery goes much deeper though, right down to the idea of **chunking**, as demonstrated with chess masters in the 1970's.\n\n\u003e \"Players learn to recognize somewhere between 25,000 and 100,000 **patterns of chess pieces.** These much more elaborate 'chunks' are combinations of pieces that the players **perceive as a unity**, and are able to reason about at a higher level of abstraction than the individual pieces [...] Memory is, in fact, a central part of cognition.\"\n\nMy sense is that having **transportable user trails**, like Bush imagined in '45, would be extremely useful. How to make this wealth of knowledge easily shareable? Just encode them as [12-word mnemonics](https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-2/shelling-out/#mnemonics) inside a [world computer](https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-1/understanding-ethereum/#generalised-compute)...\n\nCreativity is largely enabled by **mastery of detail.**\n\n### Designing insight\n\u003e \"The design and mathematical insights are inextricably entangled: the mathematical insights are, in some sense, design insights, and vice versa [... This is] a general truth: the most powerful tools for thought *express deep insights into the underlying subject matter* [... Mnemonic media] will express deep original insights into memory [...] A truly great memory system will be cognitive science of the highest order.\"\n\nThis general truth reveals the deep difference between what Alan Kay called \"pop\" and \"research\" cultures. ==Pop culture is great at producing products we consume, but is insufficient for creating new tools for thought.==\n\n\u003e \"This is not the common argument that making new tools can lead to new subject matter insights for the toolmaker, and vice versa. New tools can lead to ==new subject matter insights for *humanity* as a whole==, and vice versa, and this would ideally be a rapidly-turning loop to develop the most transformative tools.\"\n\n\u003e \"Doing this is a **cultural struggle.** It seems to be extraordinarily rare to find the ==insight-through-making loop working at full throttle== [...] You have brilliant researchers who think of making as something essentially trivial, 'just a matter of implementation'. And you have makers who don‚Äôt understand research, who see it as merely a slow and dysfunctional process.\"\n\n### Extending our mnemonics\n\u003e \"Watching this video is a remarkable **emotional** experience. It‚Äôs obvious the person narrating the video loves mathematics, and you cannot help but **empathize** [...] It‚Äôs tempting to overlook or undervalue this kind of emotional connection to a subject. But it‚Äôs the foundation of all effective learning and of all effective action [...]\n\n\u003e \"Is it possible to create a medium which has the emotional range possible in video ‚Äì a range which can be used to convey awe and mystery and surprise and beauty? [...] ==To create an integrated medium, with a unified and carefully crafted emotional and intellectual experience?\"==\n\nWe must take emotion as seriously as movie, music, and video game designers do. All of these people have elaborate models for emotional response, which we must also take into account if we are to augment our freedom to think with digital tools.\n\nThe foundation of all effective long-term learning is **emotional connection to a subject.**\n\nTools for thought are public goods. Thus they suffer from the same issues around funding and building the right kind of practices and processes required for real development.\n\n\u003e \"Consider our most fundamental tools for thought ‚Äì language, writing, music, etc. Those are public goods [...] These tools all introduce fundamental new mental representations and operations. Those aren‚Äôt owned by any company, **they‚Äôre ==patterns owned by humanity.==**\"\n\n\u003e \"We need to develop a powerful ==praxis==, a set of ==core ideas== which are explicit and powerful enough that new people can rapidly assimilate them, and begin to develop their own practice.\"\n\nWhy is it worthwhile devoting yourself to an open-ended endeavour like this which isn't as well-funded as many other sectors in tech? Well, because:\n\n\u003e \"The creation of language ‚Äì the ur tool for thought ‚Äì is perhaps the most important occurrence of humanity‚Äôs existence [...] Similarly, the invention of other tools for thought ‚Äì writing, the printing press, and so on ‚Äì are among our greatest ever breakthroughs.\"\n\nWhat will new tools for thought *really* look like? Our contention is that protocols for money are exactly one such tool and - given that money preceded writing - they are also an ur tool.\n\n\"If we could communicate the experience in an essay, then the tools would be failing at their job; they would not be **transforming** a person‚Äôs thinking, or even their **consciousness**.\"\n\n### Executable books\n\u003e \"**Scaffolded exploration**: a way to build up your own understanding, and perhaps even push the frontiers of knowledge. It‚Äôs tempting to regard [Jupyter notebooks] as merely a mashup of essay and code. But really they‚Äôre a new media form, with different possibilities from either essays or code, and with striking opportunities to go much further.\n\n\u003e \"There‚Äôs a general principle here: ==good tools for thought arise mostly as a byproduct of doing original work on serious problems== [...] Furthermore, ==the problems themselves are typically of intense personal interest to the problem-solvers.== They‚Äôre not working on the problem for a paycheck; they‚Äôre working on it because they desperately want to know the answer.\"\n\nEmbedding narrative into new tools for thought encourages **[scaffolded](https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-3/remember/#how-does-this-fit-into-kernel) exploration** as a way to build up your own understanding.\n\n### Emotional ends\n\u003e \"You could begin an executable book with material the users already care about, can connect to easily, and find motivating [...] but such an opening won‚Äôt suffer the drawback of popular science, of being vague and imprecise. Rather, the interface would be completely ==well specified== and could be ==scaled out==, applied in ==ever-expanding contexts==. The understanding would be ==transferable==. Even a user who has understood only a tiny part of the material could begin tinkering, building up an understanding based on **play and exploration.**\"\n\nThis is the first part of what it really means to \"take back the web\". It's about building public tools for thought which - like language - are really patterns owned by humanity as a whole, in which we can playfully explore with each other the very edges of our shared record of knowledge, adding new pieces as scaffolding for those who follow to continue the fun.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T15:56:57.01213667Z","tags":null},"/Resource-Notes/Kernel-Learn-Track-Module-4":{"title":"Kernel Learn Track - Module 4","content":"See [[Kernel MOC]]\n## Internet Age Institutions\n+ [Chesterton's Fence](https://fs.blog/2020/03/chestertons-fence/) story: don't break down barriers the function of which you do not fully understand. \n+ We must go back and understand more clearly ==what kinds of institutions we may need== to keep our world wide web safe to walk through gaily.\n+ Instituions need not be things like The Federal Reserve, or a government department, or a place you go when you need to spend some time separate from society. \n+ We have - for instance - the institution of marriage: which is ==a **practice** or a **custom**.== It is in this sense which we will be using the word for the rest of Module 4.\n+ The internet routes information around slow-moving bureaucracies and so requires that ==we update the practices and customs we use to relate to one another and **organize ourselves.**==\n+ It has caused critical shifts in three spheres of human life:\n\t+ How we identify ourselves\n\t+ How we reach consensus\n\t+ How we experience time\n+ Through the language of hierarchy (meaning no rulers, not no rules), views of institution-as-practice or custom can be collected under the term [\"counterpower\"](https://abahlali.org/files/Graeber.pdf)\n\n\u003e Institutionally, counterpower takes the form of what we would call institutions of direct democracy, consensus and mediation; that is, ==ways of publicly negotiating and controlling that inevitable internal tumult and transforming it into social states (or if you like, forms of value) that society sees as the most desirable:== conviviality, unanimity, fertility, prosperity, beauty, however it may be framed.\n\nFocussing in on the notion of custom and conviviality, we can tur to Ivan Illich for another important perspective on the critical words for this week, **commons** and **custom**:\n\n\u003e A commons is not a public space. ==A commons is a space which is established by custom.== It cannot be regulated by law. The law would never be able to give sufficient details to regulate a commons. A typical tree on the commons of a village has by custom very different uses for different people. The widows may take the dry branches for burning. The children may collect the twigs, and the pastor gets the flowers when it flowers, and the nuts from it are assigned to the village poor, and the shadow may be for the shepherds who come through, except on Sundays, when the Council is held in the shadow of the tree.\n\n\u003e The concept of the commons is not that of a resource; a commons comes from a totally different way of being in the world where it is not production which counts, but bodily, physical use according to rules that are established by custom, which never recognizes equality of all subjects because different people follow different customs. **Their differences can be recognized in the way they share the commons.**\n\n### Week 4 Firesides\n+ [Andy Tudhope](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijmmKr-ZjsU)\n+ [Mariano Conti](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtNvB6D2Emw)\n+ [Dandelion Mane](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djQhzNA9bzc)\n\n## Govern Yourself\nPeople think governance is hard.

It is far too easy to be an over-collector, so your low score suggests you are able to avoid most of the pitfalls around collecting too much information. Just make sure you don't totally close yourself off from diverse and competing viewpoints.\n\t- Ideation Index: 42\n\t\t- A high score in the Ideation Index suggests that, for you, thinking is inherently joyful‚Äînot just a means to an end. Prioritizing ideas and thinking makes it easier to maintain a healthy and sustainable relationship to Knowledge. Just be careful of getting so lost in your castle of thoughts in the sky that you become fragile in the physical world.\n\t- Churn Index: -8\n\t\t- You are not at risk for skipping sense-making for the sake of money-making. But pay attention to your Production Index. If you score low there, you'll want to be aware of a potential pitfall. (Those results are next.)\n\t- Production Index: 0\n\t\t- Scoring in the middle of the Production Index suggests that you are naturally able to balance your desire to learn just for the sake of learning with your desire for achievements and progress.\n\t- Emergence Index: -32.55\n\t\t- You easily brainstorm and generate ideas. You have no problem with being spontaneous and are able to adjust quickly to new information. Like a fish in water, you swim in lateral thinking. However, without some order, you feel scatterbrained and often wonder, \"Where did I put my phone again?\"\n\t\t- Damn that hit hard\n- Thinking Style\n\t- ![[images/Pasted image 20230202085617.png]]\n\t- ![[images/Pasted image 20230202085636.png]]\n\t- If your bottom-up score is higher than your top-down score...\n\t\t- **‚ÄúDivergent Thinker‚Äù**¬†(Healthy tendency): You are comfortable without having a complete high-level picture. Instead, you are able to work with limited information and follow the trail of enthusiasm, clues, and connections. You generate a lot of thoughts. The question is, can your divergent thinking lead to emergent thinking? \n\t\t- **‚ÄúScattered Thinker‚Äù**¬†(Unhealthy tendency): When taken too far, your tendency for bottom-up thinking can lead to a chronic sense of anxiety around trying to find things‚Äîwhether it's car key or old notes.

Right now, I'd say that the sensemaking workflows that resonate the most with  me is **The Daily Spark** (no Weekly Arc), since I do most of my note-taking in Daily Notes.

He believed that ==learning should be deeply personal and students should learn a broad range of subjects to allow them to participate in greater democracy==. This was in contrast to the administrative progressive who favored a more pragmatic view on educated: ==a vocational approach in order to train workers to fuel the economy.==\n\n\u003e In response to this, Dewey wrote 2 articles to address vocational education. Dewey argued that vocationalists like Snedden erred in two respects:; their vision of vocational education is too closely allied with the interests of industrialists to serve the greater public interest, and; it suggests an imprudent approach to educational reform, whereby no meaningful change is ever forthcoming. ==Vocationalism merely props up the status quo==, a disappointing state of industrial relations warranting the continued exploitation of workers by management.\n\n\u003e This line of thinking falls into Snedden's view of education and society: ==people are either consumers or producers==. In this model of education, ==education is a tool to increase their potential earnings and escape poverty==; the status quo is always upheld. When someone is educated, another uneducated person slots right into the role.\n\n\u003e On the contrary, Dewey's vision of democratic education serves more beyond increasing earning potential. He envisioned that ==with proper rich education experience, people will be better equipped to cure social ills== that need to be addressed including poverty and crime as well as health concerns.","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T15:56:57.01213667Z","tags":null},"/Resource-Notes/Monomythical-Newsletter":{"title":"Monomythical - Newsletter","content":"## Information\n- **Source:** [[Nadia Eghbal]]\n- **Tags:** #internet #creators \n- **Notes:** [[Literature Notes/Monomythical - Literature Notes]]\n\n## Highlights\n### 24: Monasteries\n- ==Knowledge work== regards us from high upon Maslow's hierarchy over the crook of its bespectacled nose; it's easy to miss right now, in light of more pressing basic needs (food, income, where to live, daily mood).

This distinction is important. ==Data does not have to be processed, whereas information does.==\n-  The utility of data lies in ==our ability to react to it.== If we have either the ==intellectual or emotional capacity== to process it, only then does it becomes information.\n-  Whenever we point to ‚Äúinformation abundance,‚Äù what we are really saying is that we have ==‚Äúendless opportunities to react to data.‚Äù==\n-  This whole process of ==previously unknown facts eventually shaping one‚Äôs perspective== is what I call the information lifecycle.\n![[Information Lifecycle.png]]\n-  The first filter is ==awareness.== This is governed by ==curiosity.==\n\t-  There are ==shades== to curiousity, from its purest form to its most restrictive.\n-  Whatever passes through becomes data, but in order for that to be processed as information, it must pass through the ==filter of reactivity.==\n\t-  What allows one to adjust the filter of reactivity is the ==strength of their capabilities.== Data becomes information only when you have the cognitive capacity to interpret it as such.\n-  Interpreting information has less to do with curiosity, and more to do with ==diligence.== Curiosity was the force that brought me to the book, but diligence is what will make that book a useful source of [knowledge](https://moretothat.com/framework-for-knowledge/).\n-  Once that information is processed, we then have the option to incorporate it into our worldview, or discard it altogether. This is decided by the final bottleneck: ==the filter of identity.==\n\t-  Identity is the collection of beliefs, ideas, and truths you hold to position yourself within the world. No matter how independent you think you are, identity is ==always constructed in relationship to something else that exists alongside you.==\n\t-  Identities organize the familiar, but divide the unfamiliar. ==The more we love the idea of ‚Äúus,‚Äù the more we hate the idea of ‚Äúthem.‚Äù==\n-  The only way we could break away from this (balancing inclusivity and exclusivity) is to ==free ourselves from the notion of identity as much as possible.== Krishnamurti calls this [‚Äúfreedom from conditioning,‚Äù](https://amzn.to/3gskMDy) where we are able to ==let go of all the societal influences== that have shaped and categorized us into certain roles.\n-  The less we need to rely on our identities to make sense of information, ==the more we can learn about the world, and uncover our true place within it.==\n\t-  Without cultivating curiosity, the awareness filter remains closed to any facts in the first place.\n\t-  Without updating our capabilities, we can‚Äôt react to whatever data we discover.\n\t-  And without letting go of identity, no amount of information will ever shift our perspective.","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T15:56:57.01213667Z","tags":null},"/Resource-Notes/Neuroplasticity-How-to-Use-Your-Brain-Malleability-to-Improve-Your-Well-being":{"title":"Neuroplasticity - How to Use Your Brain Malleability to Improve Your Well-being","content":"## Information\n- **Source:** [Accelerate Learning Community](https://accelerate.uofuhealth.utah.edu/resilience/neuroplasticity-how-to-use-your-brain-s-malleability-to-improve-your-well-being)\n- **Tags:** #mentalhealth #psychology \n\n### Highlights\n#### What it is, and why it's important\n\u003e Neuroplasticity, or¬†**the capacity for our brain cells to change in response to our behavior**, can help us more thoughtfully engage in activities that will contribute to our well-being‚Äìno matter our age.\n\n\u003e We can influence our brain development in positive or negative directions. The more we engage and challenge our mind and body, the longer our brains function at a high level.\n\n#### How it works\n\u003e Neuroplastic change occurs at the chemical, structural and functional levels of the brain. These changes work in concert with one another.\n\n\u003e **Chemical change**¬†occurs in the initial stages of learning something new. Chemical change primarily influences short-term memory or short-term improvement in a motor skill.\n\n\u003e **Structural change**¬†occurs when neurons in the brain change their connections, altering your brains structure. This type of change requires more effort and time. It involves long-term memory and long-term improvement of a motor skill.\n\n\u003e **Functional change**¬†occurs when entire brain networks change. These brain networks, as they are used over and over again, become more excitable and more efficient when activated.\n\n\u003e ==The more the brain is exercised, the stronger and more connected it becomes.== The connections occur across the brain‚Äôs grey and white matter. Grey matter is neural tissue that includes regions of the brain involved in muscle control, sensory perception (e.g., seeing, hearing), memory, emotions, speech, decision-making and self-control. White matter connects grey matter regions together.\n\n#### How to get started\nNeuroplastic change requires five components:\n|       **Component**        |                                                                                     **How It Works**                                                                                     |                                                                                      **Try It Now**                                                                                      |\n|:--------------------------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|\n|  **Challenge \u0026 Novelty**   |                              The skill should be new-to-you and not too easy to learn. Novelty and challenge are essential components for cognitive change.                              |                                     Think of something you‚Äôve always wanted to try (e.g., learn a new language, mountain climbing, play the guitar).                                     |\n|       **Intention**        | The skill you are practicing must have some meaning, relevance, or importance to you. Neuroplastic change is associated with the feeling of being rewarded while engaging in a new task. | Think about¬†_why_¬†you want to learn this skill (e.g., I love traveling, I love being in the mountains, I love guitar music). Make sure it matters to you personally, then write it down. |\n|   **Specific Attention**   |                                           The skills we practice tend to improve. Focusing on exact tasks increases the likelihood of change.                                            |                                    Have a plan. Schedule time in your calendar to focus on this task. Consider setting a personal goal and incentive.                                    |\n| **Repetition \u0026 Intensity** |                                     One-and-done is not enough. Shorter bouts of intense repetition are usually needed to creating new connections.                                      |                                             Check in with yourself weekly. Have you been following your plan? If not, adjust and keep going.                                             |\n|          **Time**          |                                     Be patient with yourself. Neuroplastic change takes time in order for structural and functional change to occur.                                     |                                                      Plan for lapses ‚Äì it‚Äôs normal.

Fads describe something that‚Äôs briefly popular but doesn‚Äôt last. Great trends reflect a mo- ment in time, but that moment is never fleeting, and the basic idea is more elevated. Good trends always focus on the shift in an underlying human behavior or belief. They don‚Äôt describe a sin- gle interesting story or a hot new product or industry. \n\t- LOCATION: Page 46\n- Trend spotting isn‚Äôt the same as identifying actual trends.

Unfortu- nately, even when that smoke arrives, there are plenty of people who suggest it‚Äôs just a smoke machine. I have referred to this state of affairs as our ‚Äúmodern believability crisis,‚Äù when we are unsure of whom and what to be- lieve or where to place our attention.\n\t- LOCATION: Page 139\n- Surrounded by so much noise from brands, media outlets, and politicians vying for our attention and blurring the line between what‚Äôs real or not, we‚Äôve become good at selectively focusing out of necessity. To do so, we are turning inward to our core beliefs and aligning ourselves with those who share them. In the process, we are also   becoming   more   closed   off   to   perspectives   that   differ   from   our   own,   a   trend   we   called   Truthing   back   in 2018. One of the effects of this introspective trend is that we are increasingly entrusting our attention to individual curators to help spotlight where we should spend our attention wealth.\n\t- LOCATION: Page 144\n- In an information economy, attention is the currency.\n\t- LOCATION: Page 144\n- Purposeful Profit\n\t- LOCATION: Page 146\n- As consumers and employees demand more sustainable and ethical practices from businesses, companies re- spond by adapting products, taking stands on issues, and putting purpose first.\n\t- LOCATION: Page 146\n- Two voices leading the connection between purpose, mindfulness and organizational performance are Dr. Eliza Shah and Paresh Shah, founders of Lifter Leadership.

Lifters are positive, purposeful workers who simultaneously uplift their co-workers, customers, communities and their company.\n\t- LOCATION: Page 146\n- In the past, brands would limit themselves to ‚Äúsoft branding‚Äù of cause-related initiatives‚Äîpreferring to take a quiet role as an invisible supporter rather than taking a public stand.

But when users delete old posts, that alters their page views and engagement time stats, skewing the data that Instagram is trying to monetize. The less accurate their data, the fewer opportunities there are to sell advertising. Desperate to stop users from deleting the data its business model depends on, Instagram introduced a feature that allows users to archive their old images instead of deleting them. As we continue to generate more data, there will be growing urgency to ensure the data is in good enough shape   to   be   usable.\n\t- LOCATION: Page 158\n- In other words, having access to a treasure trove of data collected by wearable devices doesn‚Äôt necessarily translate to health providers finding meaning in it.

Earn Money Making Games - Essay","content":"## Information\n- **Source:** [[Cecilia D' Anastasio]]\n- **Tags:** #metaverse #games #creators #business \n- **Notes:** \n\n## Highlights\n[How Roblox is Exploiting Young Game Developers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gXlauRB1EQ)\n\n\u003e ‚ÄúWith most of the games on the platform being made by minors and ==a revenue split that's just one third of the industry standard==, we looked into whether these young developers were in fact being exploited.‚Äù (Traditionally, game stores have taken a 30 percent cut of revenue that publishers earn on their platforms, and hand 70 percent over to the devs. _Roblox_ [gives developers](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/articles/developer-economics) just 25 percent, plus payouts based on engagement.)\n\n\u003e People Make Games‚Äô analysis of _Roblox_‚Äôs economics highlights the chasm between _Roblox_‚Äôs promise as a way for kids to become game developers and the reality: ==It is very challenging to make money on _Roblox_, and _Roblox_ profits from people trying.==\n\n\u003e _Roblox_ provides a lot for its developers: server space, marketplace infrastructure, cross-platform capability. Roblox Studio is, like the game, free. Developers can make money through _Roblox_ with its [Developer Exchange program](https://www.roblox.com/develop/developer-exchange), or DevEx, which gives developers 25 percent of a game‚Äôs earnings. (Part of _Roblox_‚Äôs [justification](https://venturebeat.com/2017/07/21/the-deanbeat-robloxs-kid-developers-make-enough-robucks-to-pay-for-college/) for this split is its huge investment in infrastructure for these devs.) _Roblox_‚Äôs VP of marketing [told](https://www.alistdaily.com/strategy/roblox-discovering-future-game-developers-entrepreneurs/) _AListDaily_ in 2018, ‚ÄúFrom the very beginning, it was about having kids develop games for other kids.‚Äù DevEx‚Äôs [terms](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005718246-Developer-Exchange-Terms-of-Use) require users to be 13 or over.\n\n\u003e It wasn‚Äôt easy. To withdraw money earned through microtransactions in a game, a developer must earn a ==minimum ==of 100,000 Robux, the platform‚Äôs in-game currency. Buying 100,000 Robux through _Roblox_‚Äôs store costs $1,000.= Selling 100,000 Robux back to _Roblox_ earns you just $350. ==Withdrawal is not even possible unless these developers pay a five-dollar monthly fee for a _Roblox_ Premium Subscription.== (_Second Life_ and _Entropia Universe_, which also allow players to sell items, respectively have $10 and $100 minimums for withdrawing money.)\n\n\u003e Smith believes ==this setup disincentivizes users from withdrawing Robux. They‚Äôre devalued off-platform, so why not spend them on other _Roblox_ games?== Smith compares _Roblox_‚Äôs currency to mining camps‚Äô company scrips, a now-illegal currency used by miners to purchase goods at company stores. Miners were encouraged to spend their money on their employers‚Äô goods because, elsewhere, the scrip was moot.\n\n\u003e A _Roblox_ spokesperson tells _WIRED_ that ==‚Äúbuilding experiences on Roblox teaches the fundamentals of coding, digital civility, and entrepreneurship and has helped many begin their careers in STEM.‚Äù ==_Roblox_ gave developers $129.7 million in the second quarter of 2021, and according to the spokesperson, over 600 developers earn over $85,000 a year from their _Roblox_ creations. The company also hosts programs and offers Developer Relations professionals to help developers succeed.","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T15:56:57.01213667Z","tags":null},"/Resource-Notes/Ortographic-media-Article":{"title":"Ortographic Media - Article","content":"## Information\n- **Source:** [[Robin Sloan]]\n- **Tags:** #technology #social #media \n- **Notes:** N/A\n\n## Highlights\n-  [[Permanent Notes/context collapse]] is the standardization of all events to fit in one generic timeline.

Day (2005) adds that this imbalance between global supply anddemand for access, ‚Äúmakes the imperative of providing a decent education for all one of thegreatest moral challenges of our age‚Äù (p. 186).\n\n\u003e In terms of its beneÓÇøts, the OECD and World Bank ( 2007) have notedthat transnational education provides ==additional capacity for countries (e.g., China) to meetthe demand for higher education.== Others can ==beneÓÇøt from foreign experience and knowledge== to improve the quality of their education system. Accordingly, it may also ==help to expand a higher education system== and to ==increase the country‚Äôs supply of highly skilled workers andacademics.== Inter-institutional partnerships may provide opportunities for organizational learning for local institutions relating to the quality and relevance of their services. The ad-dition of transnational programming also adds ==variety and choice== to domestic systems. Hope(2005) adds that transnational educational programs ==introduce competition and the potentialfor greater innovation== in the available educational programs. She also notes that the ==range,prestige and quality of domestic programs may be enhanced== through domestic/foreign part-nerships. Of course, when one considers the cost of relocation, accommodation and interna-tional fees associated with studying abroad, Hope has observed that there is often a ==cost savings== to the student associated with the delivery of transnational programs. Hope (2005)and others have also noted that transnational distance programs may ==reduce the magnitudeof ‚Äúbrain drain‚Äù== arising when domestic students travel abroad for desired programs. Brain drain may be reduced in two ways. First, given the capacity of elearning technologies totranscend vast distances provides opportunities for those who have migrated in student ex-change programs to ==keep in contact with their homelands and may participate in capacitybuilding== through teaching in elearning programs (Altbach et al., 2009). Second, and moreimportantly, given access to the global classroom, domestic graduates can ==remain at hometo contribute to the local knowledge economy. ==Moreover, given that approximately half ofthe world‚Äôs instructors hold no more than a bachelor‚Äôs degree, and most of those are in thedeveloping world, transnational partnerships ==may bring needed expertise and professionaldevelopment== to disadvantaged countries.\n\n\n\u003e However, as noted by the OECD and World Bank ( 2007), the global classroom is not a panacea. There have been concerns raised about the ==quality of foreign programs== and ==‚Äúrogue‚Äù or bogus providers== (Hope, 2005). Foreign provision may simply provide ==short-term, unsus-tainable imported capacity that vanishes when the domestic demand or resources run out.==The acquisition of foreign credentials may result in brain drain. ==The simple importation ofpre-packaged programs may lead to the comodiÓÇøcation of education== (Hope, 2005). It mayalso be ==irrelevant to local needs, or worse, culturally inappropriate and lead to a devaluationof local knowledge== (Lien, 2006) and ==cultural homogenization== (Askeland \u0026 Payne, 2007 ).==Patterns of domination== may be maintained, as Larsson, Boud, Dahlgren, Walters and Sork(2005) observed, by domestic institutions and students who demand that foreign providersoffer content identical to its home country. However, such a stipulation may lead to ==culturally irrelevant programming and the devaluation of local knowledge.== Hope (2005) has similarlynoted similar impacts arising from ==the use of English and standardized curriculum ratherthan national language and culturally appropriate curriculum.== Such programs, that are generally much more expensive than domestic programs, ==may worsen equity problems== if foreignprograms are only available to afÓÉÄuent families. Indeed, the cost of these programs may besimply out of the reach of many of the students in need of such programs and thus may nothave any noticeable impact in meeting the demand for higher education. There is also theconcern of ==widening the ‚Äúdigital divide‚Äù== (Allport, 2001; Hope, 2005) and ==domestic socialand economic disparities== (Colle \u0026 Roman, 2004). Similar concerns are observed for domesticeducational institutions that lack the resources of foreign providers and may be restricted bydomestic funding and regulatory regimes.\n\n+ [[Permanent Notes/Education lives within a system of domination and liberation]]\n+ [[Permanent Notes/Digital learning exacerbates and reproduces inequality]]\n\n\u003e ==The idea of universal knowledge, skills and values‚Ä¶is a prerequisite for a global mar-ket==‚Ä¶Relationships between developed, powerful countries and cultures and developing,powerless countries and cultures are like ==colonial relationships== in a new way. (pg. 164)\n\n\u003e Forms of open and distance learning offered around the world by institutions in English-speaking developed nations might ‚Ä¶constitute an ==invasion that colonizes and denieslocal culture and knowledge and underestimates learners==. (Larsson et al 2005, p. 62)\n\n\u003e For some the impact of globalization on higher education offers exciting new opportun-ities for study and research ==no longer limited by national boundaries==. For others thetrend represents an ==assault on national culture and autonomy.== It is undoubtedly both.(Altbach, Riesberg \u0026 Rumbley, 2009, p.ii-iii)\n\n\n\u003e For those who will be teaching in the global classroom, competency involves more thanacademic credentials and proÓÇøciency, as instructors also need to become more ==culturally, ifnot globally, competent.== Heffernan and Poole (2005) note global competency begins with ==self-awareness of one‚Äôs own cultural norms and expectations.== Additionally, others suggestthat the global teacher needs to approach the classroom with ==acceptance and curiosity==; thatis, having an open mind while seeking to understand cultural norms and expectations ofstudents (Hunter, White, \u0026 Godbey, 2006). In this way, the instructor‚Äôs awareness of themulticultural context will enable him or her to recognize cultural differences and multipleperspectives as assets rather than obstacles to teaching. Where appropriate, the instructormay also need to ==recognize and respond to differences between high and low context cultures==(Germain-Rutherford \u0026 Kerr, 2008) and ==adopt greater ÓÉÄexibility and use a variety of instruc-tional tools, methodologies and student/instructor roles== (Seufert, 2002).

Fast is busy, controlling, aggressive, hurried, analytical, stressed, superficial, impatient, active, quantity-over-quality. Slow is the opposite: calm, careful, receptive, still, intuitive, unhurried, patient, reflective, quality-over-quantity. It is about making real and meaningful connections with people ‚Äî culture, work, food, everything.‚Äù\n\n\u003e Unfortunately, our education system, at least in North America, has been deeply influenced by the ==‚Äúneed for speed‚Äù,== or what George Ritzer has termed ==‚ÄúMcDonaldization‚Äù== ‚Äî that is, ==‚Äúthe process by which the principles of the fast food industry are coming to dominate more and more sectors of the world.==\n\n\u003e Ritzer outlines four characteristics¬†of this mechanistic worldview: ==efficiency, predictability, calculability (quantifiable results) and control== ‚Äî or at least the illusion of control. In regards to education, McDonaldization attempts to wipe out any of the messiness or inefficiencies of learning. Instead, it attempts to reduce it to a ==commodity that can be packaged, marketed and sold.== Rather than¬†cultivating a deep, holistic love of learning that touches every aspect of a student‚Äôs life, ==learning has been reduced to an assembly line.== In reality, we‚Äôve imposed a mechanistic view of life onto how people learn, which is largely an organic process, and at a great cost.\n\n\u003e Education continues to ==rapidly adopt short-cuts== that reflect the dimensions of McDonaldization. Essentially, this imposition seeks the most efficient (read, easiest) way to get a student from kindergarten to grade 12 . ¬†In an assembly line, ==things are homogenized as much as possible.== In education we tend to see this in the assumption that the most important thing a group of kids have in common is the year they are born.\n\n\u003e Efficiency has also the birthed the idea that ==teachers can be replaced by Khan Academy==, and the ridiculous class sizes that many teachers now have to deal with. I don‚Äôt doubt that the Khan Academy can transmit information, but that‚Äôs assuming that the transition of information is the most important part of learning. Can it help to develop our children into thoughtful , ethical citizens, who critically evaluate, rather than being swayed by the flavour of the day? Does it create¬†citizens, instead of consumers? ==When learning is treated as one more product to be consumed, a horrible disconnect occurs in our students. It becomes about the mark. It becomes about the diploma. It becomes about the end justifying a lot of terrible means.==\n\n\u003e Predictability causes the ==standardization of a curriculum, and the way it‚Äôs taught, with little or no regard for student interest, background or ethnicity. ==Every student must be able to display the same skill (or regurgitation of content knowledge) at the same time. However, it‚Äôs important to be able to calculate if any of this is making a difference, so a system of high stakes testing is introduced.\n\n\u003e And of course, there must be a way to control those involved. ==Fear. Fear of losing one‚Äôs job. Fear of losing funding. Fear of embarrassing test results being published. Fear of one‚Äôs child not being able to get into college to get a ‚Äúgood‚Äù job.== There‚Äôs an awful lot of fear in education today, and the truth is, we have no idea what the long term cost of this is either. We know in the short term, we lose a lot of new teachers in the first five years. We know that others quit early or need stress leave. We know that children are more heavily medicated now more than any other time in history. So how do we change all of this insanity?\n\n\u003e The Slow Food movement ==abdicates the industrial food conglomerates==, and seeks to reconnect citizens to the richness of a common life with the neighbours who grow and prepare our food. The Slow movement¬†is a call for intentionality, an awareness of our mutual interdependence with all people and all creation. And it seeks to root people in their community.\n\n\u003e Slowness doesn‚Äôt require everything be done as slow as possible. Instead, it seeks to ==do things well \u0026 at the right speed.==\n\n\u003e So what does the Slow movement mean for education? It asks us to reimagine what it means to be a community of learners. ¬†It requires us to admit to, and evaluate the organic, messiness of learning. It requires admitting that a large part of what is happening isn‚Äôt good for our children, our teachers, or our communities. Rather than a top down industrialized and homogenized assembly line of education, we need a ==grass roots development of education that takes into account what real learning looks like and what children really need.==\n\n\u003e Instead we need a reimaging of what learning can be: ==Slow Education==. As Honore states, ‚ÄúWe are doing a great disservice to our children by pushing them so hard to learn things earlier and earlier and by keeping them so busy. They need time and space to slow down, to play, to be children. Across the world, parents, politicians, adults in general are so anxious about children nowadays that we have become too interventionist and too impatient; we don‚Äôt allow them enough freedom. ‚Äù\n\n\u003e The principles of the Slow Food movement are ==good, clean, and fair.== I imagine the principles of the Slow Education movement as ==authentic, individualized, and formative.==\n\n\u003e ==**Authentic** education== requires that learning not be based on worksheets, standardized tests, or the myriad of other terrible things we subject children to. Instead, it allows children of all ages to engage in real, meaningful work that matters to them and their community. Learning that gives them an authentic purpose and a role in society, other than consumer-in-training. It allows students to discover the everyday citizens in their community and how they are working to make it a better place. Furthermore, it empowers kids with the opportunity to identify and seek solutions to the problems in their community. As a consequence of these changes, it¬†seeks to re-educate our communities to see students as authentic, active participants in community life. Authentic education is also an act of justice. It‚Äôs about allowing kids the chance to explore social issues and helping them become ethical citizens who speak out and make a difference.\n\n\u003e ==**Individualized**.== Enough¬†homogeneity. Education must be responsive to the real needs of students. We need to shift to using content to teach skills, student interest and most importantly teaching kids how to learn. It needs to put the onus of learning on those who have the most at stake: students. It requires teachers to become co-learners, and let go of control. It requires districts to trust administrators, administrators to trust teachers, and teachers to trust students. It requires a great deal of conversation about what real learning is and why it matters. It allows kids to explore what matters to them, to build things that don‚Äôt work, and to figure out why. It requires them to form opinions and justify them based on solid evidence. And it requires adults who care and can speak carefully, and honestly into the lives of their students. Supporting all of this is a community that is deeply connected to the life of the school.\n\n\u003e Finally, all learning should be ==**formative**.== We talk a lot about formative and summative assessment. But I honestly wonder why¬†we even have summative assessments? Bottom line? To give a mark. To give the test score. So kids can have marks for college. Marks should be abolished. I realize that‚Äôs a strong statement, but I have good reasons for saying so. In addition to being an arbitrary symbol that we‚Äôve given an awful lot of power to, it means very little. What does 82 mean? Really. I‚Äôve asked students that question. I‚Äôve asked parents and other teachers, as well. No one really knows. Does it mean you don‚Äôt know 18% of the stuff? And which 18%. What if it‚Äôs the really important 18%?\n\n\u003e So what is the bottom-line of the slow education movement?\n‚úì We abolish the¬†busy, controlling, aggressive, hurried, analytical, stressed, superficial, impatient, quantity-over-quality education environment that prevails today.\n‚úì We educate parents and communities about the risks of today‚Äôs current model, including the drawbacks of ‚Äúedubusiness.‚Äù\n‚úì We create learning environments that are¬†carefully crafted, receptive, still, intuitive, unhurried, patient, reflective, quality-over-quantity and engaging.\n‚úì We develop curriculum that has greater depth than breadth.\n‚úì We make sure our curriculum takes into account local culture and celebrates the uniqueness of our local community.\n‚úì We don‚Äôt isolate skills development but let students grow their skills as they engage with important content.\n‚úì We construct learning environments that foster questioning, creativity and innovation, such as the maker movement and project/problem based learning.\n‚úì We find the courage to have serious discussions about abolishing standardized testing, classroom marks and grading, and the use of ‚Äúbirth year‚Äù as our primary criterion for sorting students.\n‚úì We lobby our governments for funds to assure true equality in education for all children.\n‚úì We discontinue the ranking of teachers and schools.\n‚úì We replace our egg-carton grades with flexible, personalized learning that takes into account when students are ready to engage in and acquire important skills.\n‚úì We make time for teacher collaboration a top priority.\n‚úì We expect all classrooms to connect students globally so they can learn from others around the world and apply what they learn in their own communities through meaningful projects and service.\n‚úì We make student voice and choice an integral part of everyday teaching and learning.\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T15:56:57.01213667Z","tags":null},"/Resource-Notes/The-Minecraft-Generation-Essay":{"title":"The Minecraft Generation - Essay","content":"## Information\n- **Source:** [[Clive Thompson]]\n- **Tags:** #games #education \n- **Notes:** \n\n## Highlights\n\u003e For one thing, it doesn‚Äôt really feel like a game. It‚Äôs more like a destination, a technical tool, a cultural scene, or all three put together: a place where kids engineer complex machines, shoot videos of their escapades that they post on YouTube, make art and set up servers, online versions of the game where they can hang out with friends. It‚Äôs a world of trial and error and constant discovery, stuffed with byzantine secrets, obscure text commands and hidden recipes. And it runs completely counter to most modern computing trends. ==Where companies like Apple and Microsoft and Google want our computers to be easy to manipulate ‚Äî designing point-and-click interfaces under the assumption that it‚Äôs best to conceal from the average user how the computer works ‚Äî Minecraft encourages kids to get under the hood, break things, fix them and turn mooshrooms into random-¬≠number generators. It invites them to tinker.==\n\n\u003e As Ian Bogost, a game designer and professor of media studies at Georgia Tech, puts it, ==Minecraft may well be this generation‚Äôs personal computer.==\n\n\u003e ‚ÄúChildren,‚Äù the social critic Walter Benjamin wrote in 1924, ‚Äúare particularly fond of ==haunting any site where things are being visibly worked on.== They are irresistibly drawn by the detritus generated by building, gardening, housework, tailoring or carpentry.‚Äù\n\n\u003e This is what computer scientists call ==computational thinking==, and it turns out to be one of Minecraft‚Äôs powerful, if subtle, effects. The game encourages kids to regard logic and if-then statements as fun things to mess around with. It teaches them what computer coders know and wrestle with every day, which is that programs rarely function at first: The work isn‚Äôt so much in writing a piece of software but in debugging it, figuring out what you did wrong and coming up with a fix.\n\n\u003e Minecraft is thus an ==almost perfect game for our current educational moment==, in which policy makers are eager to increase kids‚Äô interest in the ‚ÄúSTEM‚Äù disciplines ‚Äî science, technology, engineering and math. Schools and governments have spent millions on ‚Äúlet‚Äôs get kids coding‚Äù initiatives, yet it may well be that Minecraft‚Äôs impact will be greater.\n\n\u003e Ito points out that when kids delve into this ==hackerlike side of the game== ‚Äî concocting redstone devices or creating command blocks ‚Äî they often wind up consulting discussion forums online, where they get advice from adult Minecraft players. These folks are often full-time programmers who love the game, and so younger kids and teenagers wind up in conversation with professionals.\n\u003e \n\u003e ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs one of the places where young people are engaging with more expert people who are much older than them,‚Äù Ito says. These connections are transformative: ==Kids get a glimpse of a professional path that their schoolwork never illuminates.== ‚ÄúAn adult mentor opens up these new worlds that wouldn‚Äôt be open to them,‚Äù she adds. Of course, critics might worry about kids interacting with adults online in this way, but as Ito notes, when there‚Äôs a productive task at hand, ==it‚Äôs similar to how guilds have passed on knowledge for ages: knowledgeable adults mentoring young people.==\n\n\u003e ==Ito has also found that kids‚Äô impulse to tinker with Minecraft pushes them to master real-world technical skills.== One 15-year-old boy I interviewed, Eli, became interested in making ‚Äútexture packs.‚Äù These are the external shells that wrap around 3-D objects in the game, like a drape thrown over a table: Change the pattern on the drape, and you can change what the object looks like. Designing texture packs prompted Eli to develop sophisticated Photoshop skills. He would talk to other texture-¬≠pack designers on Minecraft forums and get them to send him their Photoshop files so he could see how they did things. He also began teaching himself to draw. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd be downloading the mod,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúlooking at the original texture and saying, ‚ÄòO.K., how can I make this a little more cartoony?‚Äô‚Äâ‚Äù Then he would put his own designs up on the forums to get feedback, which, he discovered, was usually very polite and constructive. ‚ÄúThe community,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúis very helpful.‚Äù\n\n\u003e For Ito, this is all a culturally useful part of the experience: ==Kids become more resilient, both practically and philosophically.== ‚ÄúMinecraft is busted, and you‚Äôre constantly fixing it,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs that home-brew aesthetic. It‚Äôs kind of broken all the time. It‚Äôs laggy. The kids get used to the idea that it‚Äôs broken and you have to mess with it. You‚Äôre not complaining to get the corporate overlord to fix it ‚Äî you just have to fix it yourself.‚Äù\n\n\u003e ‚ÄúIn Minecraft, ==knowledge becomes social currency==,‚Äù says Michael Dezuanni, an associate professor of digital media at Queensland University of Technology in Australia. Dezuanni has studied how middle-¬≠school girls play the game, watching as they engaged in nuanced, Talmudic breakdowns of a particular creation. This is, he realized, a significant part of the game‚Äôs draw: It offers many opportunities to display expertise, when you uncover a new technique or strategy and share it with peers.\n\n\u003e Most online games don‚Äôt require kids to manage the technical aspects of how gamers interact...But Minecraft is unusual because Microsoft doesn‚Äôt control all the servers where players gather online.\n\n\u003e What this means is that ==kids are constantly negotiating what are, at heart, questions of governance.== Will their world be a free-for-all, in which everyone can create and destroy everything? What happens if someone breaks the rules? Should they, like London, employ plug-ins to prevent damage, in effect using software to enforce property rights? There are now hundreds of such governance plug-ins.\n\n\u003e Seth Frey, a postdoctoral fellow in computational social science at Dartmouth College, has studied the behavior of thousands of youths on Minecraft servers, and he argues that their interactions are, essentially, teaching ==civic literacy.==\n\n\u003e Running a server becomes a crash course in how to compromise, balance one another‚Äôs demands and resolve conflict.\n\n\u003e Several parents and academics I interviewed think ==Minecraft servers offer children a crucial ‚Äúthird place‚Äù to mature==, where they can gather together outside the scrutiny and authority at home and school. Kids have been using social networks like Instagram or Snapchat as a digital third place for some time, but Minecraft imposes different social demands, because kids have to figure out how to respect one another‚Äôs virtual space and how to collaborate on real projects.\n\n\n\u003e His son, Joseph says, is ‚Äúat home but still getting to be with a friend using technology, going to a place where they get to use pickaxes and they get to use shovels and they get to do that kind of building. I wonder how much Minecraft is meeting that need ‚Äî that need that all children have.‚Äù ==In some respects, Minecraft can be as much social network as game.==\n\n\u003e ==Just as Minecraft propels kids to master Photoshop or video-¬≠editing, server life often requires kids to acquire complex technical skills.== One 13-year-old girl I interviewed, Lea, was a regular on a server called Total Freedom but became annoyed that its administrators weren‚Äôt clamping down on griefing. So she asked if she could become an administrator, and the owners said yes.\n\n\u003e Mimi Ito has found that the ==kids who acquire real-world skills from the game ‚Äî learning logic, administering servers, making YouTube channels ‚Äî tend to be upper middle class.== Their parents and after-¬≠school programs help them shift from playing with virtual blocks to, say, writing code. So educators have begun trying to do something similar, bringing Minecraft into the classroom to create lessons on everything from math to history. Many libraries are installing Minecraft on their computers.","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T15:56:57.01213667Z","tags":null},"/Resource-Notes/The-Rise-and-Fall-of-Internet-Art-Communities-Essay":{"title":"The Rise and Fall of Internet Art Communities - Essay","content":"## Information\n- **Source:** [[Kelsey Ables]]\n- **Tags:** \n- **Notes:** \n\n## Highlights\n\u003e Before big tech shepherded the vast number of online users onto a handful of sleek websites, there was a scrappier internet‚Äîwhere offbeat chat rooms and eccentric niche websites reigned, and carefully crafted ‚Äúaway statuses‚Äù were a kind of personal branding‚Äîback when you could be away from the internet. ==Until attention spans became a commodity, the internet was dreamed of as a ‚Äúbastion for people to direct their own education,‚Äù== as Charles Broskoski, co-founder of internet bookmarking site [are.na](http://are.na/), remembers.\n\n\u003e The internet presented a ==breadth of opportunity for all kinds of artists==‚Äîoften of marginalized identities or with artistic interests unrecognized by institutions.\n\n\u003e Before advanced search engines, information floated on databases like a string of scattered islands. ==Communities formed out of necessity to help early users surf the boundless web.==\n\n\u003e Unlike the quantifiable interactions that pass for interactivity in 2019, such as ‚Äúlikes‚Äù and ‚Äúreactions,‚Äù there was genuine engagement in DeviantArt‚Äôs chat rooms and forums. ‚ÄúA culture developed on DeviantArt where comments simply saying things like ‚Äòcool!‚Äô and ‚Äònice!‚Äô were frowned upon,‚Äù Van Baarle explained. ‚ÄúPeople wanted in-depth comments and feedback, with constructive criticism.‚Äù Today, she added, ==the quality of conversation is ‚Äúdisappearing on the big social-media platforms like Instagram.‚Äù==\n\n\u003e Then, in the 2010s, Instagram capitalized on the mass adoption of smartphones, and Facebook grew into a site larger than any country in the world. And while artists have made their mark on all of the major social-media networks, these new, bigger sites have changed the way we communicate and consume. Algorithms steer us back to similar content in echo chambers that inhibit both critical and creative thinking. Platforms incentivized to keep users scrolling discourage long-looking and render users as passive consumers, rather than active seekers of inspiration.

Ideas are worth nothing unless they‚Äôre executed.‚Äù \n\u003e -- *Anything You Want*, Derek Sivers\n\n\n\u003e Companies don‚Äôt have a problem coming up with good ideas, no, companies have plenty of ideas! ==The problem is that they can‚Äôt choose which ones to commit to and execute and which ones to ignore.== They don‚Äôt have systems for commiting to ideas and really seeing them through, they often try to do every idea at once and never do any of them well.\n\n\n\u003e The goal of the Commit phase is to take our prioritized solutions and create a plan of action for actually making it happen.\n\n\n#### Section 3: You're A Workshopper\n\n##### AJ\u0026Smart Free Training Webinar\n\n##### Facilitation Guidebook\n###### Workshop Preparation\n+ **Warm up the participants**\n\t+ Icebreaker\n+ **Set ground rules**\n\t+ No judgement\n\t+ Break every 90 minutes\n+ **Set expectations**\n\t+ It's common that this might feel too rushed\n\t+ Often it will feel like we're losing ideas because we're moving fast\n\t+ The exercises will feel weird/awkward, and that's totally normal\n\t+ Normal not to have any ideas yet\n\t+ Normal to feel like it's not going to work\n+ **Get expectations**\n\t+ What are you hoping to get out of this?\n\t+ What will make this worthwhile for you?\n\t+ What do you hope to achieve today?\n+ **Agenda and Structure**\n\n###### How to Give Clear Instructions\n+ **Formula for Clear Instructions**\n\t+ What (the exercise)\n\t+ Why (reason)\n\t+ How (instructions)\n+ **Remember the 3X Rule**\n\t+ To minimize the chances of anyone missing a vital piece pf info, make sure to say important things 3 times\n\t+ No need to repeat exactlly thr same, judt make sure to reiterate your point or provide several examples\n+ **Remove unnecessary options**\n\t+ More options only add confusion\n\t+ Only show one way of doing an exercise\n+ **Show, don't tell**\n\t+ Examples help us understand concepts better since they take ideas from an abstract descriptionand make them concrete by giving them context\n+ **Use insight statements**\n\t+ There's only so much the mind can absorb before losing focus\n\t+ While it's good to give a detailed explanation of a concept/excercise, make sure to summarize it with an insight statement\n\t+ An insight statement tells people the \"why\" and gives context for the task\n\t+ Examples:\n\t\t+ The big idea with this excercise is...\n\t\t+ The most important thing about this is...\n\t\t+ The way to do this excercise well is...\n\n###### Principles of Remote Facilitation\n1. **Energy**\n\t1. Bring way more energy than you normally would\n\t2. Leave time for a warm-up and icebreaker activity\n\t3. Put on some workshoppy music\n\t4. Have more breaks than you would in a normal workshop\n2. **Communication**\n\t1. Slow down\n\t2. Buffer in a bit more time for discussions\n3. **Guidance**\n\t1. Make use of progressive disclosure: only share information participants need to know\n\t2. Minimize the neec to switch between a video call and the remote collaboration board\n4. **Sort Out the Tech**\n\t1. Have a plan B for every single tool you're using\n\t2. Prepare for the worst-case scenario, have several backups\n5. **Simplicity**\n\t1. Keep it simple\n\t2.

We rarely think about this sort of natural, basic self-centredness because it‚Äôs so socially repulsive. But it‚Äôs pretty much the same for all of us. It is our default setting, hard-wired into our boards at birth.\n- learning how to think really means learning how to exercise some control over how and what you think. It means being conscious and aware enough to choose what you pay attention to and to choose how you construct meaning from experience. Because if you cannot exercise this kind of choice in adult life, you will be totally hosed. Think of the old clich√© about ‚Äúthe mind being an excellent servant but a terrible master.‚Äù\n- If you‚Äôre automatically sure that you know what reality is, and you are operating on your default setting, then you, like me, probably won‚Äôt consider possibilities that aren‚Äôt annoying and miserable. But if you really learn how to pay attention, then you will know there are other options. It will actually be within your power to experience a crowded, hot, slow, consumer-hell type situation as not only meaningful, but sacred, on fire with the same force that made the stars: love, fellowship, the mystical oneness of all things deep down.\n- in the day-to-day trenches of adult life, there is actually no such thing as atheism. There is no such thing as not worshipping. Everybody worships. The only choice we get is what to worship. And the compelling reason for maybe choosing some sort of god or spiritual-type thing to worship‚Äìbe it JC or Allah, be it YHWH or the Wiccan Mother Goddess, or the Four Noble Truths, or some inviolable set of ethical principles‚Äìis that pretty much anything else you worship will eat you alive.\n- The really important kind of freedom involves attention and awareness and discipline, and being able truly to care about other people and to sacrifice for them over and over in myriad petty, unsexy ways every day.\n- That is real freedom. That is being educated, and understanding how to think. The alternative is unconsciousness, the default setting, the rat race, the constant gnawing sense of having had, and lost, some infinite thing.\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T15:56:57.01213667Z","tags":null},"/Resource-Notes/Trick-Mirror-Book":{"title":"Trick Mirror - Book","content":"#unfinished\n## Information\n- **Source:** [[Jia Tolentino]]\n- **Tags:** #nonfiction #essays\n- **Notes:** [[Trick Mirror (Literature Notes)]]\n\n## Highlights\n- As more people began to register their existence digitally, a pastime turned into an imperative: you had to register yourself digitally to exist.\n    - The I in the Internet, p. 5\n- The call of self-expression turned the village of the internet into a city, which expanded at time-lapse speed, social connections bristling like neurons in every direction.\n    - The I in the Internet, p. 7\n- Where we had once been free to be ourselves online, we were now chained to ourselves online, and this made us self-conscious.\n    - The I in the Internet, p. 7\n- But you can‚Äôt just walk around and be visible on the internet‚Äîfor anyone to see you, you have to act.\n    - The I in the Internet, p. 8\n- our world‚Äîdigitally mediated, utterly consumed by capitalism‚Äîmakes communication about morality very easy but makes actual moral living very hard.\n    - The I in the Internet, p. 9\n- The internet reminds us on a daily basis that it is not at all rewarding to become aware of problems that you have no reasonable hope of solving.\n    - The I in the Internet, p. 11\n- five intersecting problems: first, how the internet is built to distend our sense of identity; second, how it encourages us to overvalue our opinions; third, how it maximizes our sense of opposition; fourth, how it cheapens our understanding of solidarity; and, finally, how it destroys our sense of scale.\n    - The I in the Internet, p. 12\n- The self is not a fixed, organic thing, but a dramatic effect that emerges from a performance.

The things you learn by yourself stick; the things that are ‚Äútaught‚Äù to you do not stick.**  \n\u003e \n\u003e The fundamental principle of education is to ==give students an environment, and tools, _where they can make discoveries themselves_==. This requires ==space, and time, and autonomy.  ==\n\u003e \n\u003e Students also need to be able to _choose_ what they learn and how they learn it, something that modern rigid curriculums and prison-like school environments do not permit.\n\n\u003e **2. Video games provide a much deeper understanding of most subjects than classical education does.**\n\n\u003e **3. Schooling mostly fails at giving you this ==deep understanding.==**\n\u003e\n\u003e  It took humans _thousands of years_ to really figure out that reality was made of atoms, and understand why this was true. Reality has [a surprising amount of detail](http://johnsalvatier.org/blog/2017/reality-has-a-surprising-amount-of-detail). The deeper you get into these questions, the more you realize that nothing is simple. ==But school didn‚Äôt leave us room to dive deep into these questions; we had to pass exams, which meant dutifully learning to calculate molecular weights, etc, without actually understanding a thing.  ==\n\u003e  The net result is: no understanding, years of waste.  \n  \n\u003e This sounds absurd, but consider that **simulations are already used widely for learning:**\n\n\u003e A video game is just: ==(a) a simulation of reality  (b) with fast feedback loops.== \n\u003e \n\u003e Learning is just the act of engaging with an external thing and performing many conjecture/criticism loops, forming conclusions, and building on them to form a body of knowledge.  \n\u003e \n\u003e So it makes sense that video games would be the primary educational environment of the future: ==they are the best way we have of (a) creating simulations of reality (b) with fast feedback loops (c) accessible at low cost.==\n\n\u003e **5. Where games mostly fall short is that they‚Äôre not that transferable to the real world. The skills you learn are highly _specific to that game_. This will change.**\n\n\u003e **6. It is currently too hard to make video games. Making it easier to create video games will massively increase the supply of good video games and cause a gradual revolution in education.**\n\u003e \n\u003e One thesis of the internet that always stuck with me comes from Evan Williams, who founded Twitter/Blogger/Medium. ==He said that the best way to create a giant internet company is to take something people want to do and make it 10x easier.==\n\n\u003e Another insight is that ==_making things easier has nonlinear effects_. ==Making something 10x easier can cause 1000x more of that thing to happen. Hence the explosion of online creativity you see on YouTube, with chess, Minecraft, math videos, Khan Academy, Twitchstreams, Soundcloud, etc; you remove a small bit of friction and get a large result.\n\n\u003e this is also why AI is important for human productivity. Most of the discourse is about how AI will ‚Äúreplace‚Äù humans. I prefer the Licklider school of thought: human-computer symbiosis. AI will make humans vastly more effective by automating tedious tasks. For example, humans can use text AI such as GPT-3 to generate ideas/boilerplate writing to get around the terror of the blank page, and then simply pick the best ones and refine/iterate on those. (AI Dril, which was based on GPT-2, was an early example of this). ==As AI gets better, ‚Äúassistive creativity‚Äù will become a bigger thing, enabling humans to create sophisticated artifacts (including video games!) easier and better than ever.==\n\nrelate to [[Resource Notes/Computers and Creativity - Thesis]], and how blockchain simplifies things (code -\u003e makes it easier to creat and to trust)","lastmodified":"2023-02-28T15:56:57.01613676Z","tags":null},"/Resource-Notes/Wellness-Wisdom-Newsletter":{"title":"Wellness Wisdom - Newsletter","content":"## Information\n- **Source:** [[Patricia Mou]]\n- **Tags:** #wellness #mentalhealth #personaldevelopment #spirituality #philosophy \n- **Notes:** [[Literature Notes/Wellness Wisdom - Literature Notes]]\n\n## Highlights\n### Vol. 23\n- Optimizing creativity and play as another goal to conquer is also a ==manifestation of an ego== that desires to remain in control and ‚Äúbe the best at x‚Äù.\n- Antidote: ==awareness==\n- Mr. Money Moustache ==Sweet Spot==\n- You can see this in mindfulness/creativity, sports like running, fame, careerbuilding, and more\n- Doing an audit of your most extreme experiences, can help you calibrate towards your sweet spot.\n- as we become more wise, we‚Äôre able to remain in ==equilibrium== through non-attachment to these peaks and troughs.\n-  ==The Golden Mean== is a sliding scale for determining what is virtuous.
