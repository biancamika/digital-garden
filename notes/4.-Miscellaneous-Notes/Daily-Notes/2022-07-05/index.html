Learning of this concept made me realize how intentional I should be with my consumption. In this hyperdigital world full of distractions, attention is a scarce resource; I want to pay attention to people that matter to me (e.g. close relationships), not corporations who want to profit from my engagement.</p><a href=#observe><h3 id=observe><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Observe</h3></a><p><img src="/Pasted image 20220705150803.png" width=auto>
<img src="/Pasted image 20220705150858.png" width=auto></p><p>These are the two moments that stood out to me in both of these films. The first shot from <em>Temptation Island (1980)</em> depicts the beauty pageant finalists dancing after acknowledging their dire circumstances (i.e. stranded in an island with no food, water, and shelter). The second shot from <em>Marcos Fiesta 2013 Flash Mob Full (2013)</em> depicts a rave-like celebration, with actors representing the Marcoses watching on-stage. I find them both similar in the sense that performance is used to distract from reality&rsquo;s problems, whether it be the danger of dying or historical revisionism.</p><a href=#reflect><h3 id=reflect><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Reflect</h3></a><a href=#temptation-island><h4 id=temptation-island><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Temptation Island</h4></a><p><em>&ldquo;What are bitches for but to bitch around with her fellow bitches?&rdquo;</em></p><p>Campy. Sensual. Funny. These are all the traits that define director Joey Gosiengfao&rsquo;s films. His masterpiece, <em>Temptation Island (1980)</em>, exemplifies all of these, and they can be best seen in this single line. Centered around four catty beauty pageant finalists, the whole film can essentially be summarized as &ldquo;bitches bitching with fellow bitches&rdquo;, and I had good fun watching it all. Hair-pulling catfights, evident queerness, unexpected cannibalism — it&rsquo;s impressive how Gosiengfao was able to pack all of these into one film. He truly was ahead of his time.</p><p>Seriously, he was. I almost can&rsquo;t believe that this film was made in the 70s, during Marcos Sr.&rsquo;s regime. This time was known as the Second Golden Age of Philippine Cinema; even if Martial Law brought about censorship and regulation, a generation of avant-garde filmmakers came into the spotlight, making films that presented the state of the human condition, and the ills of Filipino society (CNN Philippines Life Staff, 2016). These dark circumstances were probably a factor in why Gosiengfao never gained an award for his work. Getting recognized in the film industry requires playing with compromise and politics; winners required righteousness and respectability, everything Gosiengfao&rsquo;s films were not (Vera, 2007).</p><p>But I believe his controversial style of filmmaking enabled him to be truly authentic. Beneath all its spectacle, Temptation Island (1980) was able to comment on
Angel Britanico (2011) writes: &ldquo;Despite maintaining a front of comedy and shallowness, Gosiengfiao’s material dips into the best and worst aspects of human nature, probing what makes people savage and what makes them human.&rdquo; This multi-layered nature is what makes his films cult classics, resonating with viewers even decades from now. I believe his spirit still lives on, as seen in the popularity of teleseryes and Drag Race. Why do we still like seeing &ldquo;bitching&rdquo;? Perhaps because it reveals so much about ourselves.</p><a href=#marcos-fiesta><h4 id=marcos-fiesta><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Marcos Fiesta</h4></a><p><img src="/Pasted image 20220705152537.png" width=auto></p><p>What struck me most from this film was seeing these two actors happily dance together. On first glance, this looks like a vintage depiction of a wholesome romance. However, it gets dark when you realize that these two actors are portraying Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos — the conjugal dictators who ruled the Philippines in 1970s. This performance was part of the Marcos Fiesta, an annual celebration held by the Ilocos Norte LGU to commemorate Ferdinand Marcos Sr.&rsquo;s legacy. Performers would do balletic dances and melodramatic theatrics based on the lives of the Marcoses, encouraged by a giant flashmob wearing Marcos shirts. This extravagant fiesta is a prime example of how the Marcoses weaponize culture. Through years of investing in art, architecture, literature, and media (e.g. Malakas and Maganda paintings, &ldquo;Golden Age&rdquo; infrastructure, BBM&rsquo;s family vlogs), they aimed to rewrite their narrative. They not only portrayed themselves as a good-looking, aspirational, national family, but also as &ldquo;origins&rdquo; of a &ldquo;New Society&rdquo;, which apparently &ldquo;&mldr;[allowed] them to cross and redraw all boundaries, social, political, and cultural.&rdquo; (Buluan, 2021; van Wagtendonk. 2022).</p><p>How exactly did the Marcoses&rsquo; works sway the public? Angel Martinez (2022) explored this by exposing a new Tiktok account to a pro-BBM algorithm; I believe the following traits can apply to their other works as well, especially the Marcos Fiesta. First, the family makes use of an &ldquo;aww&rdquo; factor. They deal with negative press by painting themselves as the victim/underdog (e.g. BBM against mainstream media, Marcos Jr. being &ldquo;unfairly&rdquo; jailed). Next, they take advantage of the power of fandom. They try to humanize themselves through &ldquo;relatable&rdquo; portrayals so that the masses can empathize with them (even if they&rsquo;re different social classes). Then, they appeal to emotion. Instead of using complicated infographics and jargon-filled speeches, the Marcoses fight with stories: breaking hearts by talking about living without a father, bringing up nostalgia by recounting the &ldquo;Golden Age&rdquo;, and sparking hope by saying &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make this country great again&rdquo; (sounds familiar?). Finally, they have trusted seals of approval. The Marcoses were able to get this far thanks to the combined power of their supporters, from disinformation leaders like celebrities and private advertising agencies to fellow oligarchs such as the Dutertes. By weaponizing culture, the Marcoses were able to put the Filipinos under an &ldquo;era of thought control&rdquo;, both then and now (Mijares, 1976).</p><p>Seeing Marcos apologists on all kinds of social media is infuriating, but I also can&rsquo;t help but feel sorry for them. Many of these supporters didn&rsquo;t have enough critical thinking skills or technical literacy to protect themselves from the Marcoses&rsquo; all-consuming narratives. We, the opposition, have a lot to learn about how this family operates. If we want to still put up a fight for these next 6 years, we need to play the long game, just like our opponents did.</p><a href=#connect><h3 id=connect><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Connect</h3></a><ul><li>cinematic mode of production<ul><li>composed of forces: technology</li><li>and relations: cast and crew</li><li>cinema is the paradigmatic example of how the act of looking has been construed by capital as “productive labor.”</li></ul></li></ul><p>How are both of these films related to the concept of power? I can&rsquo;t help but think like a Marxist, seeing how much power struggles have influenced their making. For me, these two films both respond to authority — the Marcos family — in opposite ways: <em>Temptation Island (1980)</em> tries to fight against their power, while <em>Marcos Fiesta (2013)</em> attempts to sustain it. The films&rsquo; forces of production are similar; materials, workers, and technology (i.e. props/VFX, actors, cinema) come together to create a visual spectacle. However, their relations of production are vastly different; Gosiengfao and his crew could be considered as part of the proletariat of his time (the director was often snubbed for awards, and many of his actors were just starting out in the scene), while the Marcoses are the epitome of the bourgeois. Overall, both films succeed in extracting the attention of their audience, which enable these films to influence their consciousness. You can either end up pondering on current society or romanticizing a new narrative; this is the power of cinema at work.</p></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li>No backlinks found</li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/js/graph.abd4bc2af3869a96524d7d23b76152c7.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by Bianca Aguilar using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, © 2022</p><ul><li><a href=https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/>Home</a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/biancamikaila>Twitter</a></li><li><a href=https://are.na/bianca-aguilar>Are.na</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
