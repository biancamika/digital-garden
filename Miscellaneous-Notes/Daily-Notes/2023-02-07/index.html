Out there are aliens so bizarre in morphology and psychology that normal means of communication are difficult at best and deadly at worst.</li></ul><p>There are two primary questions to answer in exploring the biodiversity of sci-fi worlds:</p><ol><li>Where did all this biodiversity come from?</li><li>What role does evolution play in this biodiversity?</li></ol><p>To be able to understand these, we turn to the only real-life example that we know for now: Earth. Watch this
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyJZNOw3IA4" rel=noopener>video</a> for a discussion on how evolution explains biodiversity.</p><ul><li><strong><a href=/Permanent-Notes/Speciation rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Permanent-Notes/Speciation>Permanent Notes/Speciation</a></strong> is an evolutionary process that gives rise to new species from pre-existing ones.<ul><li>What this implies in science fiction is that all of the sci-fi aliens that we know had ancestors, unless the species itself is the progenitor of all life.</li><li>But speciation is a long process (on Earth, it normally takes at least a million years) and requires <strong>reproductive isolation</strong> or the inability of two formerly intermingling and reproducing populations to keep on mating.</li><li>Usually, that&rsquo;s due to a geographical barrier that physically separates them, which is the mode of speciation called <strong>allopatric</strong> (allo = different, patric = land). In many of these shared universes, allopatric speciation may explain why so many humanoid species look alike; they probably shared ancestors and just evolved separately because they were separated by space!</li></ul></li><li>Also important in understanding speciation is the concept of the <strong><a href=/Permanent-Notes/Niche rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Permanent-Notes/Niche>Permanent Notes/Niche</a></strong>, which ecologically speaking is ==the set of all possible environmental conditions that will allow a population to sustain itself.==<ul><li>According to the <strong><a href=/Permanent-Notes/Competitive-Exclusion-Principle rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Permanent-Notes/Competitive-Exclusion-Principle>Permanent Notes/Competitive Exclusion Principle</a></strong>, ==no two species can occupy the same niche at the same time indefinitely.== Two species can compete for the same resource for only so long; the outcompeted will have to diverge from the niche and thus potentially become a new species, or else go extinct.</li><li>A lot of sci-fi worlds with vicious apex predators, especially intelligent ones, probably won their dominance in this way. And then there are those that expand their genetic reach in even more fearsome ways: through forceful parasitism and assimilation.</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Points for Discussion</strong></p><ol><li>Can the niche of a sci-fi species be considered a novum of its own? If yes, how so?</li><li>Look for examples of alien species in a shared sci-fi universe that are (or may be) results of allopatric speciation.</li></ol><a href=#the-life-out-there-attempts-at-classification><h4 id=the-life-out-there-attempts-at-classification><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>The Life Out There: Attempts at Classification</h4></a><ul><li>In biology, we try to make sense of species and their evolutionary relationships through <strong>classification</strong>, which is ==placing them in distinct groups called taxa (singular: taxon)== like specific kingdoms (e.g. Plantae, Animalia), phyla (e.g. Chordata, Arthropoda, Cnidaria), classes (e.g. Mammalia, Amphibia, Insecta), etc. that share very similar characteristics.<ul><li>This, along with naming species, is a practice in the science of <strong>taxonomy</strong>.</li></ul></li><li>Like what Sir. Ron says in his article &ldquo;Mutations and Metamorphoses: Body Horror is Biological Horror&rdquo; (Journal of Popular Film and Television 40:160-168, 2102) about hybrids in body horror cinema, ==the other-ness of aliens may perhaps be treated as a <em>taxonomic</em> cognitive estrangement, because they defy Earth-based categorizations even if they seem similar to our life-forms.==</li><li>When trying to make sense of sci-fi aliens, it is ==safe to assume that life on these other planets have the same genetic code and follow the same genetic mechanisms and evolutionary tendencies as life on Earth==, unless the text tells us otherwise.<ul><li>So we can expect very similar forms to Earth&rsquo;s organisms, with liberal modifications, to populate fictional worlds.</li><li>On Earth, the most common animals are arthropods (those like insects, spiders, and crustaceans that have jointed appendages and a hard chitinous exoskeleton), molluscs (soft-bodied often shelled animals like snails, bivalves, and squids), and chordates (the large group that includes vertebrates like ourselves). Can we expect to see the same trends in science fiction?</li></ul></li></ul><a href=#exercise><h5 id=exercise><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Exercise</h5></a><p>As a an exercise in exploring the biodiversity in sci-fi, go to the
<a href=https://aliens.fandom.com/wiki/Alien_Species_Wiki rel=noopener>Alien Species Wiki</a> and select one (1) alien species (try one that isn&rsquo;t too popular or obvious!) and use the following dichotomous key to try to classify it according to Earth definitions (which as of now are the only ones we have to go by!). We&rsquo;ve said that the cognitive estrangement in these alien life-forms may lie in their blurring of our taxonomic categories, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that we can&rsquo;t try to make sense of them!</p><p><img src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23095578/217153022-f01aaf3e-d173-4f2a-963d-bb28203746a9.png width=auto alt=image>

All science fiction is produced by at least one author rooted in what we know as the real world (what Suvin calls <strong>&ldquo;the set normative system&rdquo;</strong>), and so ==every work of science fiction is necessarily informed by and responding to the real world==, at least as perceived by the author.
- This is ideally true on a scientific level&ndash;if we believe good science fiction is at least somewhat informed by the principles of good science&ndash;but it is also true on a literary level.
- What this means is that we, as both readers and authors of science fiction, come into it with ==our own set of biases that shape our reading==, and these are perspectives we can both employ and interrogate when it comes to examining the fantastic <em>nova</em> that inhabit our stories.</li></ul><a href=#hyperlanes><h5 id=hyperlanes><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Hyperlanes</h5></a><ul><li>In the Kickstarter-backed <em>Hyperlanes</em>, a sci-fi campaign setting that uses D&D 5th edition rules, race (here called species) selection in the process of character generation provides more flexibility, allowing a player to create new species using template traits for common biological forms. Read Chapter 1: Species of the player&rsquo;s guide.</li><li>For this discussion and the special quiz, you need to read the section on Physiology (starting on page 6), but we highly encourage you to read the entire chapter.</li></ul><p><img src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23095578/217154024-52f14d64-125b-4a96-aba2-bf65a204dc92.png width=auto alt=image></p><p>Here are the Physiologies that the book offers as options, with Ron&rsquo;s notes on the biological bases for their suggested traits:</p><ul><li><strong>Amphibian:</strong> I wouldn&rsquo;t say that amphibians are naturally more dexterous than us or our fellow mammals, but their tongues are definitely quick at capturing prey! Take note that not all amphibians can leap like frogs do, because salamanders are also amphibians, and so are some limbless, snake-like animals called caecilians. Quite a number of amphibians do have poisonous skin, so that&rsquo;s a good call, but usually you&rsquo;d have to ingest the animal or get its toxins in your blood to be affected (and that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re poisonous and not venomous). But the more accurate traits here are Prefers the Damp and Water Adapted. Being direct descendants of fish and spending their larval stages in the water, amphibians are largely semi-aquatic, and they cannot survive in dry environments because they need to breathe through their skin.</li><li><strong>Arthropoid:</strong> In kingdom Animalia, the term &ldquo;arthropoid&rdquo; would actually refer to organisms that belong to phylum Arthropoda, which is distinct from other groups of animals due to their exoskeleton made of chitin or calcium carbonate, which they typically shed, and their jointed appendages (including legs and wings). So the Body Armor and Extra Limbs traits have those covered. It&rsquo;s good that they didn&rsquo;t include flight as a trait because insect wings are too flimsy to allow a human-sized individual to truly fly.</li><li><strong>Arachnoid:</strong> Biologically speaking, arachnids are actually also arthropods, but I suppose having the ability to produce your own webbing gives you the right to your own template. The Spinnerets trait covers that and is amusingly accurate because that&rsquo;s really what a spider&rsquo;s silk-spinning appendages are called. Take note, however, that scientifically, the term arachnid refers not only to spiders but also to scorpions, ticks, mites, and harvestmen (daddy longlegs).</li><li><strong>Aquatic:</strong> It&rsquo;s a catch-all template that could easily mean you&rsquo;re fish-like as much as it can mean that you&rsquo;re a giant jellyfish. The Water Mastery trait is obvious, but the 360 Vision and Pilot&rsquo;s Mind traits are inspired additions because being surrounded by water and receiving stimuli from all around you at the same time does give you a different sort of perspective (I could imagine). This is especially true of radially symmetrical organisms like jellyfish that have sensory cells arranged all around their bell (that round part that looks like a head but isn&rsquo;t), but in a certain amusing way, the same can also be said of fish because of their lateral line system and the freaky fact that they have taste buds on their skin.</li><li><strong>Avian:</strong> The writers aren&rsquo;t fans of the aarakocra, are they? Instead of giving this template true flight, they limit the wings&rsquo; capabilities to gliding. I wouldn&rsquo;t use size as an excuse, as there have historically been pretty big natural fliers in Earth&rsquo;s history, but it would make sense for avian characters to have lighter, hollow bones, so I would probably consider decreasing Constitution a bit. Birds, especially the predatory ones, do usually have keener eyesight and larger optic lobes than most other animals, so Superior Vision and Pilot&rsquo;s Mind are a nice touch.</li><li><strong>Cephalapoid:</strong> Did anyone say Cthulhu? The amazing group of animals called cephalopods, which is a type of mollusk, deserves so much more than the typical aquatic traits and the Extra Limbs feature. I&rsquo;d personally throw in a Constitution increase given their toughness, something that enhances their Perception because of their sensory acuity, and some special camouflaging ability due to their ability to control their pigmentation. Now THAT would make an awesome character race.</li><li><strong>Fungoid:</strong> Dispersed Physiology? Iron Constitution? Mycotoxins? Saprophyte? These authors had a ball with designing this template, the most unique of all of them (maybe they were on shrooms). Each of these traits is spot-on in portraying the novelty of the lowly fungus and makes for a character design unlike any other. if I were to nitpick, I&rsquo;d swap the touch-dependent Mycotoxins ability with one that allows the character to disperse poisonous spores, but that&rsquo;s probably asking for too much. And also, fungi don&rsquo;t have brains. Or a head. But we&rsquo;re talking about humanoid fungi anyway.</li><li><strong>Gastropoid:</strong> Another mollusk, gastropods are a group of animals known mostly for the shells that they have on their backs, but do note that there are shell-less snails (generally called slugs). The Slime Trail is a nice (if a bit gross) touch, though I&rsquo;d have added some form of communication with fellow gastropoids in that ability. Also, the Armored Body trait is cool and all, but let&rsquo;s all remember that you&rsquo;d have to be lugging that large, cumbersome thing around with you. One question: can they hide inside their shells?</li><li><strong>Mammalian:</strong> Given how highly social an animal a typical mammal is, the Group Behavior feature makes sense. The four subtemplates give some variation to what would have been an otherwise uninteresting template (there&rsquo;s only so much benefit you can gain from fur and mammary glands) and touch on peculiarities of some major mammalian lifestyles.</li><li><strong>Plantoid:</strong> Obviously, Photosynthesis is the best and most scientifically accurate feature of this template. I would have taken that trait further to waive the character&rsquo;s need to eat food as long as it gets regular sunlight exposure.

Ron&rsquo;s Notes</h5></a><ul><li>Let&rsquo;s dwell a bit on something that Sir. AJ just mentioned: <strong><a href=/Permanent-Notes/Eusociality rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Permanent-Notes/Eusociality>Permanent Notes/Eusociality</a>.</strong> Among animals, eusociality is the ultimate expression of altruism: ==individuals in a colony are willing to sacrifice themselves for the benefit of the colony. ==<ul><li>Think bees, which die when they sting threats to their hive and their queen. As you may have guessed, such selfless living is quite rare in the natural world. Most known eusocial species, of which there are only few, are insects like bees and termites. There are a few in the marine environment like certain species of sponge-dwelling shrimp.</li><li>Among mammals, there&rsquo;s only one type of animal known to be eusocial. No, it&rsquo;s not humans. It&rsquo;s the naked mole rat.</li></ul></li><li>What do eusocial species have in common? It&rsquo;s important to take note that they live in tightly knit groups, specifically colonies, where a distinct division of labor is dictated upon by genetically predetermined roles.<ul><li>Because young that are born into the colony do not leave the home, there ends up being an overlapping of generations. Typically, there is only one reproductive female and so is the source of all progeny, making all her offspring virtually identical (especially in cases where there is also one only reproductive male). That&rsquo;s partly why self-sacrifice is ok, specifically from a genetic perspective; ==the loss of one individual isn&rsquo;t too much to bear if there are many other individuals that are genetically identical== (and since we&rsquo;re talking about organisms like insects, when we say &ldquo;many,&rdquo; we mean many).</li><li>All non-reproductive individuals have roles in maintaining the colony, with the largest ones usually being relegated to defensive functions (and that&rsquo;s why most eusocial species are characterized by some weapon, like a bee&rsquo;s sting, an ant&rsquo;s mandibles, a shrimp&rsquo;s claws, and a naked mole rat&rsquo;s&mldr;naked ugliness? It&rsquo;s a confusing animal.).</li></ul></li><li>It&rsquo;s fascinating how ==true altruism has been used by sci-fi as the basis for many of the most frightening characteristics of malevolent alien bug races, including the &ldquo;hive-mind&rdquo; social structure== (which, luckily enough for us feeble humans, is also often their greatest weakness, as exemplified by Starship Troopers and Ender&rsquo;s Game).<ul><li>Speaking of the hive-mind, the members of a eusocial colony are of course not joined telepathically and they don&rsquo;t &ldquo;think and act as one,&rdquo; but their collective actions are certainly guided and their social structures maintained by pheromones, which are hormones used within a species for a variety of purposes like finding mates, marking territory, tracking food sources, etc.</li><li>And killing the queen will weaken the colony and cause a lot of disarray for a while, but it won&rsquo;t kill all the other individuals like some sort of kill switch. In fact, queens that die are usually quickly replaced by the next dominant female.</li></ul></li><li>Having said all of that, the sandkings have many other peculiarities that don&rsquo;t have an analogue in the real biological world, which I think begs the question: <em><strong>Do they behave like this in the wild?</strong></em> Or maybe an even better question is: <em><strong>Do they actually exist in the wild, or are they a scientific creation, such as through genetic engineering?</strong></em> They&rsquo;re as mind-boggling as naked mole rats.</li></ul><a href=#the-pet-owners-gaze-as-power-dynamic><h5 id=the-pet-owners-gaze-as-power-dynamic><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>The Pet-Owner&rsquo;s Gaze As Power Dynamic</h5></a><ul><li>It&rsquo;s impossible to really talk about the sandkings without also talking about Simon Kress, their owner and the ostensible protagonist (if not hero) of the story.</li><li>Kress&rsquo; relationship to the sandkings is ostensibly ==panoptic, quite literally a relationship built around watching them:== he buys them as entertainment and keeps them in a clear tank that allows them to view them from above.</li><li>The sandkings&rsquo; ability to look back up at him is limited by their small size, his great height and distance, and the rather more pressing matter of the other sandkings trying to kill them.</li><li>The sandkings can only escape Kress&rsquo; perception by burrowing underground or remaining within their castles, while Kress can fully evade and manipulate the sandkings&rsquo; perceptions of him through leaving the vicinity of the tank and changing the hologram of his face that he willingly and voluntarily provides them.</li><li>More, while Kress can always affect the sandkings&ndash;through giving or withholding food, manipulating their environment, stabbing them from above, and so on&ndash;the sandkings in turn cannot affect him in turn without leaving the tank.

(#TeamSandkings, btw.)</li></ul></li><li>==Colonized and colonizer alike are scarred by the relationship of domination:== the sandkings are warped and traumatized, both while Kress is in control and even after they escape the tank. Kress, meanwhile, eventually begins to be subsumed into the telepathic hive-mind himself and is later forced to flee his home, but even before the sandkings escape, we see how the sandkings bring out his worst tendencies, encouraging him to make insane choices that center them, and his obsession with and control over them, in his life.</li></ul><a href=#sandkings-unite><h5 id=sandkings-unite><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Sandkings, Unite</h5></a><ul><li>Ultimately, &ldquo;Sandkings&rdquo; is a story about power&ndash; ==the power we wield over those we perceive, the ways in which the powerful and the seemingly powerless interact, what power does to us all. ==</li><li>It&rsquo;s also just a really fun story about a terrible asshole of a man and the incredibly interesting bugs with which he becomes obsessed.</li><li>It&rsquo;s a great example of part of the course&rsquo;s spirit: ==our encounter with the alien, our recognition that the alien is at once more different from and more similar to us than we realized, and the ways in which we are changed by this recognition.==</li></ul><p><strong>Discussion Questions</strong></p><ol><li>Do you think the sandkings&rsquo; status as bug aliens affects the reading of them as colonial subjects?</li><li>Pick one of the sandking colonies.

<img src="/images/Pasted image 20230208004402.png" width=auto></li></ul></li><li><p>The Swarm is also an example of another classic science fiction trope, one that often occurs in combination with the alien bug trope: the <strong>assimilator</strong>, ==a type of creature that integrates other species into itself. ==</p><ul><li>When combined with the alien bug, the assimilator trope produces inhuman hordes of creatures that are often described as ravenous spacefaring locusts, devouring entire worlds and integrating their native sapient and non-sapient populations into themselves to create new breeds and castes.</li><li>Semiotically, this takes the alien-as-inhuman-Other image that is so associated with the bug alien and takes it a step further: the assimilating bug alien is an Other that is not only inhuman, but an inhuman Other that is potentially capable of taking what is human and transforming it into something inhuman. Other-ness as infection, as contagious, as disease.</li></ul></li><li><p>If you want to read ==alien hives as a defamiliarization of collectivist societies as imagined by predominantly white writers from individualistic Global North cultures==, it&rsquo;s pretty telling that such writers often write these swarms to be actively bent on <strong>expansion</strong>, as if the biological ability to assimilate necessarily brings with it the desire to do so (or alternatively reinforces it, as if expansionism is a natural, assumed way of thinking, which is itself an interesting notion to unpack).</p><ul><li>In that same vein, it might be worth exploring how this trope lines up with ==how the Global North has portrayed collectivist cultures, philosophies, and ideologies in general==, but that&rsquo;s a whole &rsquo;nother thing. (I imagine that for many writers, envisioning conquest as literal biological assimilation, outside of any statements about collectivism, whether implied or intentional, is just too tempting a metaphor to pass up!)
