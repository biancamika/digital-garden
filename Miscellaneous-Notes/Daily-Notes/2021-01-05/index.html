The Fortified Self<ul><li>&ldquo;I sit with all possible versions of myself&rdquo;</li></ul></li><li>&ldquo;too weird or difficult to proceed towards the sawmill&rdquo;</li><li>Manifest Dismantling: our current notions of productivity aren&rsquo;t creative, but destructive</li><li>Capitalism appropriating everything</li><li>Appropriating myself; individualistic part of me selling off everything else</li></ul><blockquote><p>“In a situation where every waking moment has become the time in which we make our living, and when we submit even our leisure for numerical evaluation via likes on Facebook and Instagram, constantly checking on its performance like one checks a stock, monitoring the ongoing development of our personal brand, time becomes an economic resource that we can no longer justify spending on ==&lsquo;nothing.&rsquo;== It provides no return on investment; ==it is simply too expensive.== This is a cruel confluence of time and space: just as we lose noncommercial spaces, we also see all of our own time and our actions as potentially commercial.”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>_“I hear, see, and smell things in a world where others also hear, see, and smell me. And it takes a break to remember that: a break to do nothing, to just listen, to remember in the deepest sense ==what, when, and where we are.==
I want to be clear that I’m not actually encouraging anyone to stop doing things completely. In fact, I think that “doing nothing”—in the sense of refusing productivity and stopping to listen—==<strong>entails an active process of listening that seeks out the effects of racial, environmental, and economic injustice and brings about real change.</strong> ==I consider “doing nothing” both as a kind of deprogramming device and as sustenance for those feeling too disassembled to act meaningfully.”</p></blockquote><p><a href=/Permanent-Notes/Doing-nothing-is-active-listening rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Permanent-Notes/Doing-nothing-is-active-listening>Permanent Notes/Doing nothing is active listening</a></p><p>^^^ omg put in Cathexis</p><blockquote><p><em>“In such times as these, ==having recourse to periods of and spaces for “doing nothing” is of utmost importance, because without them we have no way to think, reflect, heal, and sustain ourselves—individually or collectively. ==There is a kind of nothing that’s necessary for, at the end of the day, doing something. When overstimulation has become a fact of life, I suggest that we reimagine #FOMO as #NOMO, the necessity of missing out, or if that bothers you, #NOSMO, the necessity of sometimes missing out.”</em></p></blockquote><p><a href=/Permanent-Notes/Doing-nothing-is-self-care rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Permanent-Notes/Doing-nothing-is-self-care>Permanent Notes/Doing nothing is self-care</a></p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;&mldr;&lsquo;To hear is the physical means that enables perception. To listen is to give attention to what is perceived both acoustically and psychologically.&rsquo; ==The goal and the reward of <a href=/Permanent-Notes/Deep-Listening rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Permanent-Notes/Deep-Listening>Permanent Notes/Deep Listening</a> was a heightened sense of receptivity and a reversal of our usual cultural training, which teaches us to quickly analyze and judge more than to simply observe.==
When I learned about Deep Listening, I realized I had unwittingly been practicing it for a while—only in the context of bird-watching. In fact, I’ve always found it funny that it’s called bird-watching, because half if not more of ==bird-watching is actually bird-listening. (I personally think they should just rename it “bird-noticing.”)== However you refer to it, what this practice has in common with Deep Listening is that observing birds requires you quite literally to do nothing. Bird-watching is the opposite of looking something up online. You can’t really look for birds; you can’t make a bird come out and identify itself to you. The most you can do is walk quietly and wait until you hear something, and then stand motionless under a tree, using your animal senses to figure out where and what it is.”</p></blockquote><a href=#against-creativity><h4 id=against-creativity><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Against Creativity</h4></a><blockquote><p><em><em>“&mldr;individualization is a key factor in the contemporary rhetoric of creativity. But the rhetoric demands even more; you have to be a particular ==kind== of individual. Too often it is white, middle-class, straight, fully abled men that are creative and innovative, and all other forms of minority identity are further marginalized.”</em></em></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><em>“What we see on our social media feeds, the songs we listen to, the information we are presented with, the news sites we visit, the people we meet and the emotions we feel are all beginning to be determined by coded algorithms. While they can bring new things into our consumption patterns (‘you listen to X, have you heard Y?’), such creativity serves only to keep us consuming. It is newness to maintain more of the same.”</em></p></blockquote><p><a href=/Permanent-Notes/Creativity-enables-consumerism rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Permanent-Notes/Creativity-enables-consumerism>Permanent Notes/Creativity enables consumerism</a></p><blockquote><p>“If creativity is about the power to create something from nothing, then believing in impossible things is its most critical component. We need to believe that impossible worlds can be reached, if these impossibilities can ever be realized and become lived experiences.”</p></blockquote><p><a href=/Permanent-Notes/To-create-something-from-nothing-we-must-believe-in-the-impossible rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Permanent-Notes/To-create-something-from-nothing-we-must-believe-in-the-impossible>Permanent Notes/To create something from nothing, we must believe in the impossible</a></p><blockquote><p><strong><em>“The ‘creativity’ inherent in politics is more about holding on to power, rather than thinking of new ways of tackling common injustices.</em></strong><br><em>This brand of politics has created governments that have systematically failed to stop – and in some cases, catalysed – inequality, global poverty, environmental degradation and the threat of global nuclear annihilation. As such, people are taking it upon themselves to manage and create new political institutions. If the Arab Spring and the Occupy movement have taught us anything, it’s that post-2008, political structures are fragile.”</em></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“To be ==radically creative== is to see connections and potential ways of augmenting each path of resistance with the other. To ==collaborate in opposition== is not easy and requires an agonistic mind set of patience, forgiveness, self-restraint and a great deal of emotional energy. Such things are in very short supply in the current suffocating environment of urban capitalism.”</p></blockquote><a href=#what-are-we-resisting-against><h4 id=what-are-we-resisting-against><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>What are we resisting against?</h4></a><ol><li><strong>The definition of a &ldquo;creative&rdquo;</strong><ol><li>Boo stereotypes boo tech bros</li><li>Being &ldquo;creative&rdquo; today = trying to fit in a mold, looking and speaking the part</li><li>Does this mean people who don&rsquo;t fit the mold are less creative?</li><li>Questions to think about: Who sets the rhetoric?
