Leftwich and Sen identify three general classifications, within which both formal and informal institutions could be observed:</p><ul><li><strong>Economic institutions:</strong><ul><li>They are about the definition, acquisition, distribution, and regulation of economic goods, such as property and services.</li><li>Formal elements include laws and policies that govern this portfolio of policy issues</li><li>Informal elements would include gender norms that pertain to rights of property ownership, class systems about access to economic goods, etc.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Political institutions:</strong><ul><li>They are about how power is obtained, used, controlled, and by whom.</li><li>The formal elements would obviously include forms of government, written constitutions, etc.</li><li>Informal elements could include cultures of corruption, familial ties, etc.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Social institutions:</strong><ul><li>They are about society and culture.</li><li>Formal elements would include governments in their capacity to regulate social relationships/behavior.</li><li>Informal elements could include matters on social cohesion, inclusion, gender, generations, and religion.</li></ul></li></ul><a href=#government-regulation><h5 id=government-regulation><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Government Regulation</h5></a><ul><li>What do these findings say about government regulation?<ul><li>As a generalization, the private sector forms preferences and perceptions on how effective or ineffective government is based on key formal and informal institutional dynamics.</li><li>When it comes to formal institutions that constitute what we may call “good governance”, the private sector looks at government regulation more favorably when government is effective in ascertaining rule of law, more efficient in its lawmaking, and more streamlined in its implementation.</li><li>Informal institutions like cultural depictions of government corruption and political ideology also have been shown to affect perceptions on government regulation</li><li>The more a culture looks at government as corrupt overall, the more likely do people consider government regulation a nuisance</li><li>Lastly, the more a government over-regulates, the more conservative cultures become averse to government regulation. The findings of this paper may have resonance for people who are frustrated with contemporary governance issues</li></ul></li></ul><a href=#what-are-organizations><h5 id=what-are-organizations><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>What are Organizations?</h5></a><ul><li><strong>Organizations</strong> are the “formally or informally co-ordinated vehicles for the promotion or protection of a mix of individual and shared interests and ideas.”</li><li>If <strong>institutions are the <em>rules</em> of the game, organizations are the <em>players</em> of the game.</strong> The two terms could be easily confused as synonyms.</li><li>Basically, institutions are the formal and informal rules that govern politics. Organizations are the groups the participate in politics.</li><li>Institutions and Organizations are different but must always be studied and understood as highly related to each other because most social, political, and economic institutions overlap. As a result, how individuals and organizations navigate these institutions becomes a point of necessary inquiry.</li></ul><a href=#how-do-institutions-contribute-to-social-and-political-change><h5 id=how-do-institutions-contribute-to-social-and-political-change><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>How do institutions contribute to social and political change?</h5></a><ul><li>Kathryn Sikkink and Martha Finnemore begin their article by explaining the shifts in approaches and assumptions made in the study of politics over the last century. They explain that for most of the 20th century, political science was dominated by an American school of thought that meshed together rationalism and realism.</li><li>With the increases prominence of decolonization and transnational advocacy networks such as the Red Cross and the World Wildlife Fund in the 1970s, the succeeding decades of political science started to take an <strong>“ideational turn”.</strong></li><li>This entailed explaining politics not just in terms of formal processes (i.e. decision-making, governance modes, elections, red tape, etc.) but also constructivist terms.</li><li>With this “ideational turn” came the implication of legitimacy and ideology in the study of politics In simpler terms, the “ideational turn” encouraged more critical questions about political processes. Instead of merely “what works” in a very functionalist-realist sense, <strong>political scientists started to ask ==“how does change really occur”== in a social constructivist sense.</strong><ul><li>Social constructivism: a sociological theory of knowledge according to which human development is socially situated, and knowledge is constructed through ==interaction with others.==</li><li>Like social <a class="internal-link broken">Constructionism</a>, social constructivism states that ==people work together to actively construct artifacts.==</li></ul></li></ul><a href=#norm-life-cycle><h6 id=norm-life-cycle><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Norm Life Cycle</h6></a><p>With this, Sikkink and Finnemore propose their framework called the Norm “Life Cycle”, which has three stages:</p><ul><li><strong>Stage 1: Norm Emergence:</strong> the characteristic mechanism of the first stage is persuasion by <em>norm</em> entrepreneurs. They attempt to convince a mass of states (or norm leaders) to embrace their own norms.<ul><li><em>Norm Entrepreneurs:</em> norms do not appear out of thin air. They are conceptualized by individuals and groups who have a strong notion of what is appropriate and desirable on their communities. Norms hope to convert society into something the norm entrepreneurs consider ??<ul><li>These entrepreneurs are important from the very beginning because they are the ones who call attention to issues, and they frame issues into a discourse that calls for urgent change</li><li>The goal is for this message to resonate and capture the imagination of the wider public. ==For norms to effectively cascade, communities must understand and believe in the image and condition of the world that the norms aim to create/protect==</li><li>In a lot of situations, norm entrepreneurs operate in spaces where other norm entrepreneurs who advocate for opposing ideas and values. The dynamic will look like two or more sides trying to prevent others from winning the public’s preference.</li><li>This <strong>“normative contestation”</strong> is a very important occurrence because new norms attempt to emerge in political spaces that already have a saturation of other norms.</li><li>In simpler terms, ==norm entrepreneurs push for norms in a political space that already has existing standards of what is acceptable, appropriate and desirable.== As such, these new norms they support and fight for hope to change, or even supplant, existing norms.</li><li>Some normative projects do not succeed in the normative contestations simply because its entrepreneurs were unable to persuade a critical mass of the public that the norms they push for are better and more desirable than currently dominant norms. However, when norm entrepreneurs do succeed, this is called a <em>tipping point</em> or <em>threshold point</em>.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Stage 2: Norm Cascade:</strong> Norm leaders socialize other actors with norm entrepreneurs as an attempt to get them to become norm followers. What encourages other actors to become norm followers? Various reasons that include pressure for conformity, desire to enhance international reputation, desire of leaders (i.e. politicians) to enhance reputation/legacy.<ul><li>The <strong>key actors in the norm cascade process are states</strong> (national governments), <strong>international organizations</strong> like the UN, and <strong>advocacy networks</strong> like Amnesty International. These three actors work for a greater level of formalization of norms and institutions.</li><li>This process involves a complex dynamic akin to a “contagion”, which Sikkink and Finnemore call <strong>“socialization”</strong>. This <strong>socialization</strong> process involves ==rich and continuous public debates and discussions that aim to recognize actors== like politicians and states that have effectively worked towards the formalization of new norms and institutions, and ==to ridicule actors== who either are failing to uphold these new standards or are refusing to do so.</li><li>A primary goal of socialization is <strong>conformity</strong>. Countries, organizations, and networks hope that all their preferred norms reach a level of familiarity in the international community that ==everyone just conforms to the norms.==</li><li>As Sikkink and Finnermore point out Axelrod’s take, they quote: “By conforming to the actions of those around us, we fulfill a psychological need to be part of a group”.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Stage 3: Norm Internalization:</strong> norms acquire a ==“taken-for-granted quality”== and are ==no longer a contentious issue in the public debate.== Examples: women’s suffrage, abolition of slavery, immunity of medical personnel during open conflict/war (i.e. Red Cross, Red Crescent, MSF)<ul><li>When norms cascade to the point that norms simply become “taken-for-granted”, or that they become so integral to how people live their lives that they don’t think about them anymore, norm internalization occurs.</li><li>Internalized norms could become both powerful because they are no longer questioned, and very ambivalent because they are no longer as critically examined in the mainstream.</li><li>When norms are ==enshrined in laws, constitutions, and contracts==, they become something for ==compliance==, sometimes thoughtless compliance.</li></ul></li><li>Question to think about: <em>Is the universality of human right a norm that still is in the process of cascade, or is it an internalized norm that is now being challenged by new emerging norms?</em></li></ul><a href=#internalization-of-norms><h6 id=internalization-of-norms><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Internalization of Norms</h6></a><ul><li><strong>Prominence:</strong> When a state recognizes the effectiveness of some key norms in other prominent and prosperous countries, they are more likely to support the cascade of such norms in their own country</li><li><strong>Intrinsic characteristics of the norm:</strong> Norms that are ==clear and specific== are more likely to be more effective in reaching internalization.

A. Stassen et al. define assessment as <strong>“the systematic collection and analysis of information to improve student learning</strong>.” (Stassen et al., 2001, pg. 5)</li><li>Our own Department of Education (2016) has also defined assessments as follows:<ul><li><em><strong>Assessment</strong> is ==the process of measuring learners&rsquo; progress in the attainment of learning standards and 21st-century skills.== The results of the various forms of assessment shall be used to quantify judgments on learners&rsquo; academic performance. It is a quality assurance tool to track student progress in the attainment of standards, promote self-reflection and personal accountability for one&rsquo;s learning, and provide a basis for the profiling of student performance.</em> <em>Thus, it is an integral part of the teaching-learning experience and provides an opportunity to improve teaching strategies inside the classroom.</em></li></ul></li><li>Here are more definitions from literature:<ul><li>All activities teachers use to <strong>help students learn and to gauge student progress</strong> (Black & Williams, 1998)</li><li><strong>Provides feedback</strong> on the effectiveness of instruction and gives student a measure of their progress (Jabbarifar, 2009)</li><li>The systematic <strong>process of documenting and using empirical data</strong>on the knowledge, skills, attitudes and beliefs to refine programs and improve student learning (Allen, 2004)</li></ul></li><li>Do you notice a pattern in these definitions? Here are the things I noticed:<ul><li>First, assessments should be ==concrete== and ==facts-based.==</li><li>Second, assessments should be ==useful for both the teacher and the student== - it should be able to provide feedback to the student on how he/she can improve, and it should be able to provide feedback to the teacher on how she/he can improve the learning experiences provided to students.</li><li>Third, assessments are used to check if students have reached the ==learning outcomes== of the module.</li></ul></li></ul><a href=#share-an-unforgettable-assessment><h4 id=share-an-unforgettable-assessment><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Share an Unforgettable Assessment</h4></a><ul><li>DLQ Final presentation about answering a Life Question</li></ul><p>One assessment that remains unforgettable for me during my stay so far in Ateneo was my final exam for the Discerning Life Questions. For this exam, all that you needed to do was answer one of your Life Questions in a 10-15 minute presentation to the teacher, using the insights you got from class. It was definitely memorable for many (including me) because this gave us the opportunity to process things we usually swept under the rug; my best friend’s life question was about why she couldn’t forgive her mother, while my life question was about why I had such a toxic relationship with dance. Honestly, the whole process felt like a therapy session: from uncovering deep traumas while outlining my script, to pouring my heart out to my teacher while doing my presentation. It was truly cathartic, and the way my teacher validated me after (i.e. pointing out the good characteristics I couldn’t see amidst my self-hatred) still makes me emotional to this day. I’ll definitely keep DLQ lessons close to my heart for the rest of my life.</p><a href=#purpose-of-assessments><h4 id=purpose-of-assessments><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Purpose of Assessments</h4></a><ul><li>Different types of assessments can help you understand student progress in various ways. </li><li>In your classroom, assessments generally have one of three purposes: Assessment <strong><em>of</em></strong> learning, Assessment <strong><em>for</em></strong> learning, and Assessment <em><strong>as</strong></em> learning. If we look at assessment in terms of these these perspectives, we get to understand what assessments are for, and who is it for.<ul><li><strong>Assessment OF learning:</strong> occurs when teachers use evidence of student learning to make judgements on student achievement against goals and standards</li><li><strong>Assessment FOR learning:</strong> occurs when teachers use inferences about student progress to inform their teaching</li><li><strong>Assessment AS learning:</strong> occurs when students reflect on and monitor their progress to inform their future learning goals</li></ul></li><li>Now, look back into your experiences as students. What were the &ldquo;assessments for learning&rdquo;,  &ldquo;assessments as learning&rdquo;, and &ldquo;assessments of learning&rdquo; implemented by your former teachers?</li><li>So based on this perspective comes two major types of assessments commonly implemented by teachers in the classroom - ==formative assessments and summative assessments.== What is the difference between the two? Watch this

She/he can use a variety of strategies such as practice exercises, asking questions, etc, which we can collectively call <strong>formative assessments.</strong> Its main purpose is to ==find out if students are on track.==</li><li>At the end of the lesson, unit, or module, teachers need to collect evidence (such as exit tickets, reflection, or a graded quiz) that students indeed reached the objectives of the lesson, unit, or module. These assessments are called <strong>summative assessments</strong>.</li></ul><a href=#evidence-of-learning><h4 id=evidence-of-learning><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Evidence of Learning</h4></a><ul><li><strong>What type of assessments do I use as evidence of learning?</strong></li><li>The <strong><a class="internal-link broken">Understanding by Design</a></strong> framework recommends for teachers to look at the skills and knowledge that the lesson, module or course is striving to develop among its students in terms of curricular priorities:<ul><li><strong>What is worth being familiar with?
