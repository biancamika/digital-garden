1. Explain context of Brave New World<ul><li>John says that the New World citizens don’t regard that ==unhappiness may also be a concept to like or to desire==, like John.<ul><li>&ldquo;But I don’t want comfort. I want God, I want poetry, I want real danger, I want freedom, I want goodness. I want sin&rdquo;</li></ul></li><li>Mustapha Mond tells him he&rsquo;s claiming the right to be unhappy (which sounds ridiculous at first), and John accepts it
2. This quote resonates with me because&mldr;</li><li>I feel very alike to John in this passage, so I think this is the reason why I like it so much. I think that ==unhappiness is also a part of life that you have to experience==; you can’t avoid it and think that everything is perfect, besides, I like some aspects of being unhappy. I really think that being a happy person during all your life would be boring. ==My aim in life isn’t to be happy, it is to live.== And life consists in feeling, in having experiences, although some of them may be unpleasant.</li><li>A perfect world has been created, a world in which everybody is happy, people don’t get bored and nobody has problems. It is the ideal paradise on earth. Huxley makes his readers think; after reading the novel, the reader is incited to think about the meaning of real happiness, and the price for it, as well the importance of truth. The reader, if he/she has understood the meaning of the novel, would ask a question: what is better: living happily ever after (although personally I think it is a stupid happiness) or living according to the truth but suffering all kind of inconveniences.</li><li>I have strong indication of masochistic personality traits.<ul><li>You may find that you have a pattern of self-defeating behaviors such as working to the point of exhaustion; feeling as if you have to accept pain and humiliation; always saying “yes” even if you mean “no”; ending up in relationships with people who are abusive towards you. You may also feel unloved, tired, and humiliated, but you do not find it easy to show others how you feel.</li><li><a href=https://existentialcafe.blog/2021/12/14/everyday-masochism-why-are-we-workaholics/ rel=noopener>https://existentialcafe.blog/2021/12/14/everyday-masochism-why-are-we-workaholics/</a><ul><li>Masochism is self-discipline run amok.</li><li>Human nature seems to reside in extremes. I don’t know why, but when we do something or believe something, we can’t half-ass it; our minds lust after broad strokes. And to so many of us, suffering is the key to bliss. Growing up, you’ll recall learning about the importance of hard work and discipline; all sorts of platitudes will easily come to mind. As a culture, who we are and become are defined by our willingness to sacrifice for better days. And when people ask you what you do for a living, they really want to know how hard and how much you work. Suffering is a fetish.</li><li>Masochism is usually thought of in the context of S&M, but it&rsquo;s much more prevalent ouside of sex&mldr; Fundamentally, masochism entails feelings of self-esteem and relief. On the one hand, we’re living up to our potential as we’re suffering; on the other, we feel less guilty and afraid of future catastrophes.</li></ul></li><li><a href=https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/tracking-wonder/201512/masochism-mastery-in-creative-fields rel=noopener>https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/tracking-wonder/201512/masochism-mastery-in-creative-fields</a><ul><li>Whether you excel in a creative field has largely to do with problems. Namely, how you respond to them. Every big idea begets a series of challenges and problems.</li><li>When we hit a wall or impasse, we usually respond in one of three ways: We react, we surrender, we get inventive.</li><li>When you react or surrender, you disempower yourself from your innate capacity to do what creative people do best: solve problems. Both reacting and surrendering also can lead to subtle self-sabotaging.</li></ul></li><li><a href=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1986/08/13/coping/97574b1b-e244-4a60-88fd-daf2c2cf23dc/ rel=noopener>https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1986/08/13/coping/97574b1b-e244-4a60-88fd-daf2c2cf23dc/</a><ul><li>==&ldquo;Everyday Masochism,"== says Brandt &ldquo;is a condition rooted in low self-esteem and guilt.

1. At first glance, this quote seems to been said by a masochist.<ol><li>The character who said this, John the Savage from <em>Brave New World</em>, could definitely be seen as one, especially in the eyes of the World State.</li><li>When Mustapha Mond tells him that his society prefers to do things comfortably, John counters this, stating that he desires &ldquo;inconveniences&rdquo; instead: God, poetry, danger, freedom, goodness, and sin.</li><li>In response to this, Mond tells him he&rsquo;s claiming the right to be unhappy, which John happily agrees to.
3. This quote resonated with me because it made me realize that I too, may be a masochist.</li><li>To be clear, I&rsquo;m not talking about masochism in the bedroom; what I&rsquo;m more concerned about is the more subtle form it takes in our daily lives. Psychologist David Brandt calls this Everyday Masochism, a condition rooted in low self-esteem and guilt. Everyday masochists tend to punish themselves for exaggerated/imagined crimes, which they express through unconscious acts of sabotage, self-criticism, and repated subordination of one&rsquo;s interests and needs (Washington Post, 1986).</li><li>In my case, such masochism mainly manifests as workaholism, or &ldquo;self-discipline run amok&rdquo; (Garber, 2021). In the following paragraphs, I will be discussing how workaholism has taken over my life (and others&rsquo;), the drivers behind this compulsive tendency, and how modernism can help us face this head-on.</li></ol></li><li>My experiences<ol><li>Career<ol><li>One of the rights John claimed was &ldquo;&mldr;the right to live in constant apprehension of what may happen tomorrow&rdquo;, and I can see how I&rsquo;ve embodied this in the exhaustive effort I put into building my career. Anxiety about my future was what led me to become career-centric early on in life.</li><li>In senior high school, I started interning for entrepreneurs; during my early college years, I got into UX/UI design; this then led me to becoming immersed in the tech industry, interning and freelancing for startups, incubators, and venture capital funds. Outside of work, I would also volunteer for local tech communities, helping other members develop their skills through my own workshops, writing, and mentorship.</li><li>While I was able to achieve tremendous success (i.e. jobs, leadership positions, and scholarships), it comes with a cost: perpetual exhaustion, which is caused by working constantly. I often get stuck in an insiduous cycle: I overwork, and eventually get burnt out; I try to rest, but eventually get restless; I end up working just so I could feel fulfilled again. What keeps me stuck in this pattern is peer pressure, which is then further exacerbated by my own high expectations. So whenever I see my peers achieve all kinds of things, I can&rsquo;t help but worry about being left behind.</li></ol></li><li>Hobby<ol><li>To escape this cycle, I sought solace in my hobbies. But even workaholism bled into this part of my life. Another right John claimed was &ldquo;&mldr;the right to be tortured by unspeakable pains of every kind&rdquo;, and I can see how I&rsquo;ve lived this out in my love-hate relationship with dance. While dance has given me immense joy and precious relationships, it has also been a source of physical and emotional pain.</li><li>You see, I really wasn&rsquo;t born to be a dancer, given my late start, bulky body, and neurodivergence. Because of these traits, I naturally lagged behind my peers. This led me to constant rejections, such as getting less attention from my teachers and failing competition team auditions.</li><li>These rejections drove me to work harder than most, but this also came with a dark side. I have a tendency to overtrain; in the past, I was afraid of taking rest days because I thought I needed to make the most of the time I have, given that I was so far behind. Of course, this led to tons of injuries, and not being able to move at full capacity made me even more frustrated with myself.</li></ol></li><li>Both my career and my hobby are examples of obsessive passion. I can&rsquo;t help but feel like these activities control me, to the point that it&rsquo;s difficult to imagine my life without them. How can I disengage from these pursuits when much of my self-worth relies on them? Is there even a me that exists outside of these passions? (Morales, 2020)</li></ol></li><li>How modernism helps deal with this issue<ol><li>I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m not the only one like this. Why are many people nowadays masochistic?<ol><li>Sam Altman: &ldquo;Existential angst is part of life. It is particularly noticeable around major life events [or] career milestones&mldr;[and] seems to particularly affect smart, ambitious people. I think one of the reasons some people work so hard is so they don’t have to spend too much time thinking about this. Nothing is wrong with you for feeling this way; you are not alone.&rdquo;</li></ol></li><li>Thesis statement: Everyday masochism is rooted in our avoidance of existential angst.
