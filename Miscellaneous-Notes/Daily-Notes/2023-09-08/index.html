My schedule is dictated by training and performances, my expenses mostly go to classes and supplements, and my social circles are filled with teammates and coaches. Because of this intense lifestyle, the art of dance feels very much like a sport to me; this is made true, considering that I have competed in various dance competitions and battles in the past. As a naturally hardworking person, I firmly believe that one&rsquo;s results or performance is determined by their own efforts; however, I must also acknowledge that many social factors made me into the athlete I am today — particularly race, gender, and socioeconomic class. In this essay, I will be discussing the influence of these factors in a macro scale (how they work in a societal context) and a micro scale (how they have personally affected me).</p><p>First, race. Filipinos are known as natural born performers. I see this in sheer amount of talent surrounding me. I would always see Filipino teams compete in international competitions like Hiphop International, World of Dance, and America&rsquo;s Got Talent; I would also hear often from my mother about the achievements of her relatives, such as winning ballroom dance competitions. The Filipinos&rsquo; affinity for dance can also be seen in its localization; dance forms that originated from other countries have now been localized to the point that they have a distinct Filipino flavor. For instance, in classical dance, this is shown by the existence of the Philippine Classical Ballet syllabus and the Filipino Contemporary dance genre; these styles are then exhibited in company productions tackling local narratives (e.g. Ballet Manila&rsquo;s <em>Ibong Adarna</em>, Philippine Ballet Theatre&rsquo;s <em>Ibalon</em>, Alice Reyes Dance Philippines&rsquo; <em>Encantada</em>). Because of this influence, I often learned dance styles through the lens of a local context (a.k.a. the &ldquo;Filipino&rdquo; way). If I were born in a different country, I don&rsquo;t think I would have had as much exposure to dance.</p><p>Next, gender. While dance is an activity open to all gender identities, some styles are associated with certain connotations; classical genres like ballet are considered feminine, while urban ones like hip-hop are considered masculine. In line with this, the first styles my mom enrolled me in were heavily associated with female sensuality: jazz and belly dance. In all my years of dancing, I barely had any male classmates/teammates; even when I joined a street dance crew in high school, majority of my peers were female. Dance, along with other sports like gymnastics and figure skating, can also be seen as &ldquo;girly&rdquo; because of its emphasis on appearance. A dancer&rsquo;s performance is judged based on their leanness, shape, and movement, and going on a show often requires them getting into costume and make-up beforehand. As a result, many female dancers are prone to body image disorders. In my case, I used to overexercise and fast for long periods of time in the past because I was considered to be &ldquo;fat&rdquo; as a dancer. If I was born male, I probably would&rsquo;ve started in hip-hop first (or other sports more &ldquo;masculine&rdquo; than dance); I also would&rsquo;ve been less likely to practice unhealthy relationships with food and exercise.</p><p>Finally, socioeconomic class. Dance is an expensive activity to invest in — especially when it comes to classical dance forms like ballet. Classes, shoes, and costumes are already costly enough, but if a dancer plans to compete, the costs skyrocket; they must also consider paying for coaching, travel, competition entry fees, etc. While street dance is more accessible, costs for competing still inhibit dancers; during the summer (a.k.a. competition season), many hip-hop dancers had to do fundraisers just to be able to compete in America. Daily living also becomes more expensive in general; for example, in order to stay in tip-top shape, professional ballet dancers require weekly physical therapy appointments. In sum, the costs of pursuing dance make it a luxury that many can&rsquo;t afford. My family is considered upper middle class, so they were able to cover much of my dance-related expenses over the years. Their class also played a role in the dance styles I started in. I grew up in a pretty sheltered environment; for most of my life, I attended private Catholic schools and relied on private transport (I didn&rsquo;t learn how to fully commute until I was in college). In line with this, I think my mother was more comfortable with me learning dance in a polished studio than outside in the streets. If my family was less well-off, we wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to afford this choice.</p><p>Overall, working on this essay made me ponder: if I was born in a different race, gender, or class, would I still be pursuing dance? No matter how passionate I am, this is hard to answer; the passion I have for dance may be innate, but I cannot deny that it was cultivated by my own circumstances. Thus, it honestly feels like the stars aligned for me just to pursue this sport. As an overcritical perfectionist, I have a bad habit of ruminating on what-ifs: &ldquo;What if I was studying dance in America?&rdquo;; &ldquo;What if I was a male dancer?&rdquo;; &ldquo;What if my parents could afford having me study abroad?&rdquo;. But now, I&rsquo;m truly grateful that my life has worked out the way it has.</p></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li>No backlinks found</li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://garden.bianca.digital/js/graph.abd4bc2af3869a96524d7d23b76152c7.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by Bianca Aguilar using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, © 2023</p><ul><li><a href=https://garden.bianca.digital/>Home</a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/biancamikaila>Twitter</a></li><li><a href=https://are.na/bianca-aguilar>Are.na</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
