When I started teaching design and technology for youth organizations during the pandemic, I myself was designing all the time: planning curricula, making tutorials, crafting materials, etc. After taking Practice Teaching ED 130.3, wherein I got to experience an onsite setup for the first time, this view of mine — teachers being designers — was only affirmed. But at the same time, there was a lot of new knowledge I gained that built on this perspective. So in this reflection, I&rsquo;ll be discussing how my internship made me both a better designer and teacher. First, I&rsquo;ll give an overview of what happened during my internship. Next, I&rsquo;ll walk through the education principles I saw at work. Then, I&rsquo;ll talk about the new insights about teaching and learning that I attained after my experience. Finally, I&rsquo;ll give actionable advice for other aspiring teachers.</p><p>I was matched up with Sir. Gabriel Mallilin, the coordinator of the Computer Subject Area. The classes that fall under this area are the following: Media Information Literacy, Empowerment Technologies, and Game Development. All of these were similar to the topics I was teaching during the pandemic.</p><ul><li>Classes followed a lecture + activity structure that I also used in my past lessons. But the way these were taught were also quite new to me, given the onsite setup.</li><li>In an online setup, you tend to focus on content kasi&mldr;I ended up forgetting about experience</li><li>I was also exposed to administrative and extracurricular work</li></ul><p>The education principles I saw at work</p><ul><li>jesuit values as design principles for education</li></ul><p>One of the insights I gained from my experience of ED 130.3 is that teachers must take into consideration learning <em>environment</em>s, not just learning experiences. I learned this in my summative demonstration, where I focused a lot on preparing the content of my lesson — to the point that I forgot to consider how I&rsquo;d be relaying this in the computer lab. While I was able to create a comprehensive and understandable presentation, only a few students were able to fully appreciate it. This was because of the lab&rsquo;s vertical layout; the presentation and stage is located at the front of the room, with the computers lined up to face it. Not only would the students seated at the back have had difficulty seeing the display from far away but they might also have been less inclined to respond, given their considerable distance from me, the teacher. I could have managed this issue by moving around the room during the lecture; it turns out that simply being in close proximity to the students tends to make them responsive.</p><p>Additionally, I&rsquo;ve come to recognize that I sometimes embody a traditional banking model of education, where the teacher is seen as the expert depositing knowledge into the minds of students, who are sponges. This was a bit painful to acknowledge, given my personal opposition to this model; I struggled with it a lot in school as a neurodivergent student. And I don&rsquo;t want my future students to experience the disconnect and frustration that I did. Thus, the teacher and learner roles suggested by Ignatian pedagogy resonate a lot with me. Instead of being a teacher who is an know-it-all expert, I&rsquo;d rather be considered as a designer of learning environment and experience. In turn, instead of being sponges, learners would become inquirers; the classroom would become a place where both parties can freely exchange knowledge from one another.</p><p>In line with this, my advice for aspiring teachers is to build rapport with your students.</p><ul><li>Even extracurricular activities count</li></ul><a href=#socsci-14><h2 id=socsci-14><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>SocSci 14</h2></a><p>#politics #society</p><a href=#module-6-citizenship><h3 id=module-6-citizenship><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Module 6: <strong>Citizenship</strong></h3></a><a href=#filipino-perspectives-and-the-idea-of-pro-active-citizenship><h4 id=filipino-perspectives-and-the-idea-of-pro-active-citizenship><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Filipino Perspectives and the Idea of Pro-Active Citizenship</h4></a><ul><li>Diokno (1997) points out, however, that the community referred to also includes the local community, as Filipinos in general struggle with <strong>“identifying with an abstraction such as the nation”</strong> (20).<ul><li>We don&rsquo;t have a nationalist identity&mldr;.</li><li>A continuing challenge then for Filipino citizenship is that of balancing ==being part of the nation-state== and being part of their ==respective local communities.==</li></ul></li><li>On good citizenship: <strong>&ldquo;The typical image of a good citizen is the tax-paying citizen, the honest voter, the driver who obeys traffic rules (a rarity nowadays).  But a good citizen is also one who ==asserts his or her rights, speaks out in defense of the voiceless, respects the environment, treats women and men equally,== and so on” (20).&rdquo;</strong><ul><li>It&rsquo;s not just about following rules! What if the rules you follow aren&rsquo;t intended for good? But for keeping you in order</li></ul></li><li>Filipino citizenship is construed in terms <strong>“of processes by which citizens ==negotiate the nature and extent of their rights== as individuals and their obligations to the community”</strong> (19-20).<ul><li>Citizenship then is understood in the context of processes of deliberation.</li><li>In the context of democratic governance, citizenship “is the very base of collective action, a shared vision, the means to a sustainable future, and the link to generations of citizens yet unborn”</li></ul></li><li>Pro-active practices of citizenship consist of&mldr;<ul><li><strong>“==indigenous, day-to-day== practices of democracy and decision-making in communities where formal government mechanisms and elected officials may or may not exist”</strong> (Diokno, 1997: 20-21). <ul><li>In so far as communities can sort things out by themselves through truly deliberative mechanisms—whether formal or informal—pro-active citizenship is practiced</li></ul></li><li><strong>“initiatives taken by ==organized== groups or sectors who engage in ==formal== democratic processes, to also explore other venues of expression and alternative solutions”</strong> (21)</li></ul></li><li>Aside from governance at the local level, Naga City is an example of the practice and process of pro-active citizenship.</li><li>Effective citizenship is a <strong>two-way street.</strong><ul><li>On the one hand, the <strong>government</strong> should ==exercise the rule of law==, and make itself ==accountable to the public==, “which involves not only merely taking responsibility for one’s acts but [also] conducting oneself according to democratic ways and beliefs” (21).<ul><li>More crucially, the government should “ensure that the ==social requisites for the practice of democracy are present:== a decent standard of living, employment, education, health and other services, and access to opportunity for improvement and a better life” (Diokno, 1997: 21).</li><li>It is established knowledge that people who are hungry and poor, and who have limited prospects for a better life would be too busy to concern themselves with concerns greater than their own, thus limiting opportunities for the effective exercise of citizenship.</li></ul></li><li>On the other hand, <strong>citizens</strong> ==“need to perform their obligations and exercise their rights” in  a collective manner== if they are to stand a chance in transforming institutions and structures that have repeatedly limited their capacities for a better life (Diokno, 1997: 21).<ul><li><strong>Organization</strong> is key in the politics of development.</li><li>Citizens acting ‘in concert’, Diokno (1997) further notes, “can map out and implement their plans, negotiate with other entities including government, and apply pressure, when necessary, to bring about the desired change” (21).</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><a href=#seeking-leadership-and-accountability><h4 id=seeking-leadership-and-accountability><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Seeking Leadership and Accountability</h4></a><ul><li>A crucial insight we can glean from the discussion of Diokno (1997) on effective, pro-active citizenship is that <strong>effective leadership is a crucial capability.</strong><ul><li>People’s participation is a function of ==organization== and an ==enabling environment,== coupled with ==“the existence of functional leaders and members”== (27).</li><li>Oftentimes effective citizenship is ==hindered by government itself==, as it “infrequently appears as a role model of positive values” (26), as and in a lot of ways “have proved to be unreliable or unstable agents for promoting responsible citizenship and democracy” (27).</li></ul></li><li>We are all familiar with a notion of leadership that emphasizes individual character and capability. <ul><li>So familiar are we to this notion that can easily name exemplars of leadership, as well as name the qualities that make them such fitting examples.  This is indeed a valid way of looking at the concept of leadership. </li><li>Politically speaking, however, ==there is more to leadership than sheer individual effort.==</li></ul></li><li>Bolden (2011) discusses how leadership can be understood not only as an individual pursuit, nor only about the structure or design of a system, but also as <strong>a social process involving other agents.</strong>  This is the main idea of <strong>distributed leadership.</strong></li><li>Citing Uhl-Bien (2006), Bolden (2011) propounds that distributed leadership is “a collective social process emerging through interactions of multiple actors” (251). <ul><li>Leadership is construed as “as group activity that works through and within relationships, rather than individual action” (Bennett <em>et.al.</em>, 2003: 3 cited in Bolden, 2011: 252). </li><li>The practice of leadership then is “a product of the interactions of…<em>leaders</em>, <em>followers</em>, and aspects of their <em>situation</em>” (Spillane and Diamond, 2007: 7 cited in Bolden, 2011: 252 Emphases in original).</li></ul></li><li>This notion of distributed leadership is politically salient in two ways.  First, distributed leadership is construed as a social process, as a function of interactions and relationships between and among people and/or organizations.  This resonates with how we defined politics in module 1: Politics is the process of people negotiating scarce resources involving relationships of power (Cf. Kerkvliet 2013, Leftwich 2011).  Leadership is political.</li><li>Second, distributed leadership is not simply a matter of technical design.  In fact, there are a variety of ways by which leadership can be distributed, as presented in Table 2 of Bolden’s (2011) essay. <ul><li>More crucially, Bolden (2011) notes that “‘distributing’ leadership <em>per se</em> is not necessarily beneficial, but that what is important is <em>how</em> leadership is distributed” (259 Emphases in original). </li><li>The question on the manner of distribution of leadership inevitably raises the questions on the reasons for distributing leadership, on the agents/organizations controlling or managing the distribution, and the other matters being distributed. </li><li>Bolden (2011) as such points out that the implementation of [distributed leadership] cannot be considered politically neutral.  It is motivated by a series of expectations, assumptions and agendas which, while a face value may appear reasonable enough, may actually serve to legitimize and reinforce the domination of particular individuals and groups over others (260).</li></ul></li><li>The state responses to the pandemic (both here and abroad) are usually couched in terms of leadership.  Inadequate responses easily lend itself to the belief that the leadership is inadequate.  While that might be true in most instances, the questions should not only focus on what the leader/s lacked in terms of knowledge, skills, and attitudes.  In the context of distributed leadership, it is also important to look at the processes, interactions, and relationships that hinder (or facilitate) adequate responses to the pandemic.</li></ul><a href=#towards-collective-action><h4 id=towards-collective-action><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Towards Collective Action</h4></a><ul><li>Citizenship is not just a matter of entitlements and obligations defined by law.  Citizenship is ==an active practice of participating in the public life==, no matter how small such participation is. <ul><li>More than an exercise of rights and duties, citizenship is also “the very base of collective action, a shared vision, the means to a sustainable future, and the link to generations of citizens yet unborn” (Diokno, 1997: 22).</li></ul></li><li>However, how do we turn collective action into palpable, lasting change?  Eric Liu (2016) asks essentially the same question:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_g1BMVFcuw" rel=noopener>&ldquo;Eric Liu: How to turn protest into powerful change&rdquo;</a>. Here are three core strategies are involved.<ul><li>First, <strong>expand the frame of the possible</strong>. <ul><li>The first battle is waged not necessarily on physical spaces (public parks, streets), but on the ==spaces of the civic imagination.== </li><li>As Liu (2016) emphasizes, ==asking the ‘what if’ question,== “and not taking as given all the givens of conventional politics” is the important first step. </li><li>However, expanding the frame of the possible needs some level of concreteness, otherwise what is being imagined becomes simply impossible.</li></ul></li><li>This leads to the second step: <strong>choose a defining fight</strong>. <ul><li>More than trying to answer the question on that which you want to fight for, this step is about defining the boundaries of the fight. </li><li>==“Powerful citizens set the terms of [the] contrast”== between an ‘us’ and a ‘them’, which is the fundamental characteristic of politics. </li><li>This distinction, however, must always be <em>agonistic</em> in that parties involved in the debate still respect each other’s humanity and rights, eschewing primarily the resort to violence.</li></ul></li><li>The third and last step is <strong>finding an early win.</strong>  <ul><li>Liu (2016) emphasizes that such win, “even if it’s not as ambitious as the ultimate goal, ==creates momentum, which changes what people think is possible==”. </li><li>The important thing to remember, however, is that what eventually would lead to palpable, lasting change is “[n]ot the single triumph, but ==the long, slow slog==”.  Early wins set in motion the grind necessary for changes to happen, and to be sustained.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>A concrete example is the story of McKenna Pope:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTK_cJVryIc#action=share" rel=noopener>&ldquo;McKenna Pope: Want to be an activist? Start with your toys&rdquo;</a><ul><li>Obviously, you live in a context different from Pope’s, and you might not have the same resources as she has.  More blatantly, her problems might not be your problems.  You might not even be the kind of person who goes to rallies.  It does not matter.  As Liu (2016) notes: <strong>“You just have to be a participant, and to live like a citizen”.</strong>  And if I may add, there is always “time to fight for a cause greater than ourselves”.</li></ul></li></ul><a href=#individual-synthesis-essay><h3 id=individual-synthesis-essay><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Individual Synthesis Essay</h3></a><a href=#guidelines-1><h4 id=guidelines-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Guidelines</h4></a><blockquote><p>Using insights from Diokno (1997), in what ways can you deepen and concretely live out your duty of allegiance to the political community? [500-700 words].</p></blockquote><p>Diokno “Becoming a Filipino citizen: Perspectives on citizenship and democracy”.</p><p>Formats.

Citizenship is an <em>active</em> practice of participating in the public life, wherein citizens constantly negotiate the nature and extent of their rights; it is not just about paying taxes and following rules (which are <em>passive</em> activities). This means that being a pro-active citizen requires a significant amount of time and energy. Given that we are human beings with limited time, energy, and resources, it would be best for us to deeply commit to 1-2 advocacies instead of spreading ourselves too thin, biting off more than we can chew.</p><p>This especially holds true when we consider that effective citizenship is hindered by the Philippine government. It is perceived by most of the Filipino public as an exemplar of negative values (e.g. corruption and stagnation), given that it has constantly shown itself to be an unreliable representative of responsible citizenship and democracy. Even worse, social requisites for the practice of democracy are definitely lacking; despite the rising costs of living, the quality of life is subpar (as seen in our broken education and health systems), and opportunities for improvement are often hard to get. Because of this, most Filipinos live on survival mode, which means they&rsquo;d have less capacity to effectively exercise their citizenship.</p><p>If I were to choose an advocacy, I&rsquo;d choose mobility. When the country was slowly shifting to a post-pandemic life last year, I frequently chose to commute in order to save money. However, I experienced first-hand how much time and energy this sucked out of me. Car-centric planning and a substandard transportation system are problems that most Filipinos can understand; this could help us with identifying as part of a nation (an abstraction that many struggle with). At the same time, these problems are most strongly felt in our own communities. For instance, I&rsquo;m most likely to complain about the traffic in Katipunan because I spend most of the week as a student here. Thus, I believe that advocating for mobility could help Filipino citizens with balancing being part of the nation-state and being part of their respective local communities.</p><p>I&rsquo;m grateful to be studying in Ateneo, where I&rsquo;m surrounded by many inspiring mobility advocates. One example is Francis Caiga, a recent political science graduate who got the Quezon City local government to create new pedestrian lanes and repair sidewalk areas in Katipunan. He did this through a formal process: calling QC&rsquo;s Engineering Department. While the estimated period for these kind of repairs is 22 days, he was able to speed it up through transparency — he would tweet frequent updates about his request&rsquo;s progression. These tweets gained traction, leading the department to get in contact with him; because of this, repairs that would&rsquo;ve been done in a month were finished in a few weeks. As a lone citizen, he expanded the frame of possibility; he not only showed that a more walkable Katipunan is possible, but also showed that &ldquo;&mldr;things [can] still work at the local government level&rdquo;.</p><p>Of course, one citizen is not enough to transform broken institutions and structures. Organization is crucial in the politics of development; to create lasting change, citizens must exercise their rights collectively. Thankfully, we have organized groups here in Ateneo that are dedicated to championing mobility by engaging in formal democratic processes and exploring venues of expression + alternative solutions. For example: working together with the school admin, the Sanggunian&rsquo;s Task Force on Mobility relays student concerns to the Tricycle Operators and Drivers Association. And this year, BlueMobility, a student organization of mobility advocates, was created; they create platforms (e.g. talks, workshops, Facebook group) where students can learn and discuss anything mobility-related. Again, I&rsquo;m grateful to be in Ateneo because of its democracy; the school provides many opportunities that empowers its members to demand for development and to participate in social processes, including development itself. When you put citizens passionate about an advocacy in such a supportive environment, collective change is bound to bear fruit. This is how you work towards a sustainable future.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Commuters have the fundamental right to expect safe and reliable transportation services</strong>.</p></li><li><p>A <em>bad commuting system prevents the public from accessing basic services—nutrition</em>, education, health care—especially in underserved areas</p></li><li><p>What did I learn from these advocates regarding pro-active citizenship?</p><ul><li>citizen asserting their rights (e.g. Francis)</li><li>work can&rsquo;t be done alone&mldr;you need organized groups and sectors holding various initiatives<ul><li>remember, organization is key in the politics of development</li><li>E.G.
