Why was that so hard?&rdquo;</em></li><li>With these words, Sinclair identifies the ==tensions of the modernist==, which have to do with the clash of the self with forces that impact on it.</li><li>And what are these forces? Why, you name them! ^c0f6dd<ul><li>We have social expectations, nature, what people say about us, what people say we should do, events like political issues, national elections, and war.</li></ul></li><li>And, on top of all that, the self clashes with the self too! The ==unconscious==, the ==psyche==, is there.</li><li>So, the modern condition is characterized by the struggle of ==Being or &lsquo;be-ing&rsquo;== as a process against all these external and internal forces.<ul><li>In other words, whereas the philosdpher, Rene Descarte, famously uttered the words, <em>I think therefore I am</em>, the modern condition might as well say, <em>I am? What is that?</em> All these forces that we struggle against have made it very difficult to figure out who we are and <em>live the life that is inside us</em>. ^69c3cc</li><li>As you go through this module&ndash;no, through the whole class&ndash;bear in mind this struggle of <em>be-ing</em>. How do I live the life that is inside of me, trying to get out? OR, what&rsquo;s my thing? And how will I know what it is?</li></ul></li></ul><blockquote><p>Can you identify some forces that impact make it hard for a person to discover a sense of self? Write no more than 150 words.</p></blockquote><p>For me, some forces that have been definitely getting in the way of <em>being</em> are societal expectations and self-imposed pressure — both of which go hand in hand. Nowadays, in a hyper-online world, we&rsquo;re exposed to the highlights of everyone&rsquo; lives; unfortunately, this exacerbates my unhealthy tendency to compare myself to others. It leads me to working myself to the bone in order to &ldquo;catch up&rdquo;, which isn&rsquo;t helpful at all. It gives me no time to discern whether or not a certain goal is good for me at all.</p><a href=#more-about-modernism><h4 id=more-about-modernism><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>More about modernism</h4></a><ul><li><em>Modernism</em> is not about a certain time period. Rather, it&rsquo;s about ==a way of perceiving, a way of be-ing, a sensibility, a way of thinking about the self==, compared to other ways of perceiving and be-ing.</li><li>Here are two poems that express different ways of perceiving the self, different ways of be-ing. On one hand, we have Romanticist John Keats and on the other hand, we have the Bard, William Shakespeare. Shakespeare lived two centuries before Keats; yet, his poem expresses a modernist sensibility.</li></ul><a href=#keats-poem-to-the-stars><h5 id=keats-poem-to-the-stars><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Keats&rsquo; poem to the stars</h5></a><p><img src="/images/Pasted image 20230201114035.png" width=auto></p><ul><li>In this poem, the persona (and the voice of the poem can be the poet or can be someone else) speaks of admiring the ==steadfastness== of a star&mldr; the forever that stars seem to symbolize.</li><li>The quality of steadfastness, which the persona admires, is ==found in nature, outside the self.== The self, then, can, like nature, have this quality.</li><li>As we read the poem, we also get the feeling that ==natural processes are to be admired and human beings, to reach the fullness of ourselves, should aspire to have the perfection of nature.== Reading Keats and you almost have the feeling that the human and nature should be one.</li></ul><a href=#shakespeares-macebeth-deathbed-speech><h5 id=shakespeares-macebeth-deathbed-speech><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Shakespeare&rsquo;s Macebeth: Deathbed speech</h5></a><p><img src="/images/Pasted image 20230201114149.png" width=auto></p><ul><li>After everything he had achieved, Macbeth knows that he is about to die. If you&rsquo;ve read the play, Macbeth did everything he could to secure power for himself and for his descendants but ==death is inevitable== and in these lines, he realizes that he has been defeated.</li><li>In these lines, Shakespeare uses a favorite comparison, that is, the ==similarity between an individual human life and a character (a player) in a stage play==, who enters and exits the stage on cue.</li></ul><a href=#comparison><h5 id=comparison><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Comparison</h5></a><ul><li>The contrast between Keats&rsquo;s poem and Shakespeare&rsquo;s illustrates some very important characteristics of the modernist sensibility.</li><li>For one thing, Keats, because of is allusions to nature, give us the feeling of the ==immortality of the self.== Even in death, we are like nature so we continue somehow, along with stars, grass, rocks, fields, the sea.</li><li>But with Shakespeare, Macbeth realizes that upon his death, he is, well, dead. His life is snuffed out like a candle, like an actor who has to leave the stage. With the modernist sensibility, ==life is rendered woefully inadequate== and it&rsquo;s only, in Macbeth&rsquo;s words, &lsquo;an idiot&rsquo; who will refuse to accept that. </li><li>But, what we learn from modernism, though, is ==despite knowing that life is finite, the process of <em>truly</em> be-ing itself seems to be what life is all about.==</li></ul><a href=#the-power-of-the-psyche><h4 id=the-power-of-the-psyche><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>The power of the psyche</h4></a><ul><li>Two important figures to modernism are the great psychoanalysts, Sigmund Freud and Carl Gustav Jung.</li><li>When Freud wrote about the unconscious and Jung, his student, continued his work, it became ==impossible to think of the human being as &lsquo;whole&rsquo;.==</li><li>If you notice, in Keats&rsquo;s poem, the notion of steadfastness is accepted as a trait that people can aspire for. The conflict comes out of the ==persona wanting that trait but maybe not quite having it yet.==</li><li>With Shakespeare, though, the conflict is in the very nature of selfhood. If tomorrow will come and we all die, then what for is ==carving a self==?</li><li>With Keats, what is at stake are ==the qualities that the self can have.== With Shakespeare, what is at stake is ==the existence of the self.== In other words, with Shakespeare, ==the self is fractured, having a nature that is at war with itself.==</li><li>Jung has pointed out that ==we are &rsquo;enigmas&rsquo; to ourselves.== Because we don&rsquo;t know ourselves, we are in a state of conflict with ourselves. ^eb7f5b</li><li>Jung has also pointed out that ==self-knowledge is usually just based on what we know of ourselves socially.== ^0ca92b<ul><li>Take myself as an example. Socially, I am female, married, middle-aged, teacher, Filipino, middle-class, educated, administrator, martial artist, crocheter, cat mom, cyclist, homemaker. All these social identifiers of who I am affect my decisions and my sense of self.</li><li>But as Jung would say, these are all just on the surface. ==It&rsquo;s what is happening in the psyche that matters.== Hence, I sometimes have strange and vivid dreams that have nothing to do with who I am socially. And this is why ==to the modernist sensibility, we all have cracks and fissures where &rsquo;true being&rsquo;,== as Jung would say, come out. </li></ul></li><li>Jung has also argued that ==the problem with society is it only cares for what is external.== The psyche itself is ignored and this leads to many problems, such as mental health and behavioral issues. He has argued that ignoring the psyche will lead us all to very detrimental effects.</li><li>To Jung, we have long forgotten to pay careful attention to the individual; ==sacrificing the individual for the collective.== Hence, modern society ignores the authentic responses of the individual, in favor of collective conditions. ^45816b<ul><li>This is why history is full of movements of collective acts (like war) but the individual may feel alienated from these collective acts. There is no such thing as a whole individual, just as there is no such thing as a whole society or culture.</li></ul></li><li>To read: <strong>Jung&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href=/Resource-Notes/The-Undiscovered-Self rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Resource-Notes/The-Undiscovered-Self>Resource Notes/The Undiscovered Self</a>&rdquo;.</strong></li></ul><a href=#what-is-reality-anyway><h4 id=what-is-reality-anyway><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>What is reality anyway?</h4></a><p>^69ac07</p><ul><li>What we also learn from the work of psychoanalysts is that reality does not necessarily exist as an objective truth. Rather, ==the world to us is defined for us by how we see it.== And how we see the world and how we are in the world are also largely ==determined by the unconscious==, by the psyche that we know so little about. </li><li>The fact that it&rsquo;s difficult to put a finger on objective reality comes out in our ==languaging.== Many of the things we say, can, after all, be questioned grammatically. For example: <em>the sky is blue, isn&rsquo;t it</em>?  <em>I am a girl, aren&rsquo;t I</em>? It can be very difficult for us to understand each other because ==we perceive reality in different ways.==</li></ul><a href=#reading-demian><h4 id=reading-demian><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Reading &ldquo;Demian&rdquo;</h4></a><p>As you read it, ask yourself how the lives of Demian and Emile Sinclair seem to give expression to Jung&rsquo;s ideas, particularly:</p><ul><li>how reality is created by our own perceptions as opposed to the perceptions of others</li><li>why the journey to the self can be terrifying</li><li>how collective action can actually both enrich and obliterate the self</li></ul><p>Question: Do you think Demian and Sinclair had found true self-knowledge?

I can connect this to my tendency to overeat, especially during times of stress; sweet foods like chocolates are often the main culprits. One simple change I can do to address this is drink water first whenever I feel hungry. Another simple change I can do is to replace my usual sweets with healthier alternatives (e.g. switching out ice cream for greek yoghurt).</p></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li><a href=/Permanent-Notes/Modernism/ data-ctx="Miscellaneous Notes/Daily Notes/2023-02-01" data-src=/Permanent-Notes/Modernism class=internal-link>Modernism</a></li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://garden.bianca.digital/js/graph.abd4bc2af3869a96524d7d23b76152c7.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by Bianca Aguilar using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, © 2023</p><ul><li><a href=https://garden.bianca.digital/>Home</a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/biancamikaila>Twitter</a></li><li><a href=https://are.na/bianca-aguilar>Are.na</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
