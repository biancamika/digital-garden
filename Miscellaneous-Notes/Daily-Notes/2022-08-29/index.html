Therefore, if you are to engage in the Hows and Whats of teaching, it would be best to first ask this fundamental question: ==Why teach?==</p></blockquote><ol><li><strong>Why is it that you are considering to become a teacher? What is your &ldquo;Why story&rdquo;?</strong></li><li><strong>What do you think has influenced your desire to teach?</strong></li></ol><a href=#labeling-our-whys><h4 id=labeling-our-whys><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Labeling our Whys</h4></a><p><img src="/images/Pasted image 20220829144244.png" width=auto></p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;<strong>Extrinsic motives</strong> involve aspects <strong>not inherent in the immediate work</strong>, such as salary, status, and working conditions. <strong>Intrinsic motives encompass inherent aspects</strong>, relating to the <strong>meaning of teaching and the passion for teaching</strong>, subject knowledge and expertise. <strong>Altruistic motives</strong> entail <strong>perceptions of teaching as a valuable</strong> and important profession and the desires to support children’s development and to <strong>make a difference in society</strong>. " (Bergmark, Landstrom, Manderstedt and Palo, 2018).</p></blockquote><p><strong>Which type of motivation do you think contributes most to effective teaching?</strong> Spoiler alert: The short answer is not one particular one.</p><ul><li>What we know from research is that teachers from developing countries often become teachers for more Intrinsic and Altruistic reasons - maybe because they see teaching as a way to uplift the social conditions of citizens of their country.</li><li>However, research also tells us that often students who join the profession for intrinsic or altruistic reasons leave the teaching profession because of a mismatch with their perception to reality.</li><li>So, if there isn&rsquo;t one particular best motivation, why does it matter to know yours? or even consider it? Despite the fact that motivation is not necessarily a predictor of effective teaching, ==why you choose to teach often means you have a certain perception about your role as a teacher - and this perception often influences your everyday decisions.==</li></ul><a href=#perceived-rolesmotivation-of-teachers><h5 id=perceived-rolesmotivation-of-teachers><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Perceived Roles/Motivation of Teachers</h5></a><ul><li><strong>Recreating the Caring School</strong><ul><li>Teacher as role model, guide, helper</li><li>Motivations:<ul><li>Shaped by positive experience = they want to recreate</li><li>Shaped by negative experience = they want to correct</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Creating a Desirable (Professional) Life</strong><ul><li>Teacher as a professional</li><li>Motivations:<ul><li>Job security (v.s. other professions)</li><li>Self-development</li><li>Influence of the future</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Fostering the Upright Human Being</strong><ul><li>Teacher as a reformer</li><li>Motivation:<ul><li>Making a difference for persons and for society</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Forming Valuable Knowledge</strong><ul><li>Teacher as an expert (academic/educationalist/with special knowledge)</li><li>Motivations:<ul><li>Usefulness of Knowledge</li><li>Passion for the subject</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Extra Resources:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SppdQHZ-4A" rel=noopener><strong>The Story of the Filipino: Teach for the Philippines</strong></a></li><li><a href=https://www.seameo-innotech.org/portfolio_page/exploring-teachers-whys-understanding-motivation-among-teachers-in-the-philippines-2/ rel=noopener><strong>EXPLORING TEACHERS’ WHYS: Understanding Motivation Among Teachers in the Philippines</strong></a></li></ul><a href=#other-teacher-factors><h4 id=other-teacher-factors><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Other &ldquo;Teacher Factors&rdquo;</h4></a><a href=#teacher-factors><h5 id=teacher-factors><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;Teacher Factors&rdquo;</h5></a><p><img src="/images/Pasted image 20220829151128.png" width=auto></p><ol><li><strong>Gender</strong><ol><li>According to research, male teachers are often more dominant, authoritarian (Dunkin, 1987; Winer, 1995 in Cruickshank, et al, 2009) and use more aggressive discipline toward boys (Rodriguez, 2002 in Cruickshank, et al, 2009).</li><li>While, female teachers more often maintain &ldquo;warmer&rdquo;, more nurturing classrooms (Dunkin, 1987; Winer, 1995 in Cruickshank, et al, 2009).</li><li>However, despite these differences cited, others also report that neither teacher gender, race or ethnicity seem to affect how much students actually learn (Ehrenberg, Goldhaber & Brewer, 1995 in Cruickshank, et al, 2009).</li><li>All this research shows that impressions on teachers based on gender still does exist. <em>As a learner, do you recognize this? Do you find yourself feeling differently about your teachers, depending on their gender?</em></li></ol></li><li><strong>Age</strong><ol><li>According to studies, there seems to be difference between novice and experienced teachers in terms of how they approach their work and their ability to adjust in teaching.</li><li>For example, new teachers are more open to trying things (Barnes, 1987 in Cruickshank, et al, 2009) yet tend to be more controlling (Fuller and Bown, 1975 in Cruickshank, et al, 2009).</li><li>While, more experienced teachers, though not as open to change, are able to adjust their teaching well and be flexible to the needs of the students and learning context (Ainley & Luntley, 2004 in Cruickshank, et al, 2009). </li><li><em>As a learner, when you compare younger to senior teachers, do you experience the same?</em></li></ol></li><li><strong>Personality</strong><ol><li>In a research of Zamorski & Haydn in 2002, students aged 11-15 reported that they thought that these characteristics were most important (here are the top 5):]<ol><li>Interacts &rsquo;normally&rsquo; (63%)</li><li>Friendly (63%)</li><li>Enthusiastic (54.3%)</li><li>Sense of Humor (52.2%)</li><li>Lets pupils talk as they work (50%)</li></ol></li><li>When we know our &ldquo;default&rdquo; natural tendency, we know if there is a need to move out of our comfort zone when it is called for.</li><li><em>How about you, what would be your &ldquo;default&rdquo; personality? What are adjustments that you think you might need to make in some teaching contexts?</em></li></ol></li><li><strong>Beliefs</strong><ol><li>Sometimes, without us knowing it, we bring these paradigms when we teach, and whether they are true or not, according to research, teachers often act on them (Fang 1996 in Cruickshank, et al, 2009).</li><li>There are many things that might influence your belief, such as how you were brought up, or the kind of education that you yourself experienced as a learner.</li><li>Teacher&rsquo;s example:<ol><li>When I was starting out as a teacher, I remember telling myself that I didn&rsquo;t want to be like those teachers who spend so much time with their students - I believed that that was not my role - I am not there to be their friend, I am there to teach them something!</li><li>However, after years of teaching, I realized that ==relationships are a prerequisite for successful teaching and learning!== I realized that in classes when I was able to name each student, and where I exerted extra effort to know each one, those were the classes where my students were most engaged.</li></ol></li><li>What is important is for teachers to be aware of them, so that they can be aware of situations where they make decisions based on them, even if they are unfounded.</li><li><em>What are your current biases and beliefs? How do you think might they affect your teaching? (the effect isn&rsquo;t always negative)</em></li></ol></li></ol><p>Apart from personal characteristics, Cruishank, et al also asserts that Experience and Preparation in Education also greatly affects ones teaching.</p><p><img src="/images/Pasted image 20220829153411.png" width=auto></p><ol start=5><li><strong>Our Teaching and Learning Preferences</strong><ol><li>These preferences are often greatly influenced by experiences in the past where you enjoyed being taught.</li><li>Your preference may be different from what is needed in the learning context and by your learners, so, again, I think what is most helpful is to know your bias- and to know when it&rsquo;s okay or not okay to follow it. </li><li><em>What is your &ldquo;biased&rdquo; learning preference?</em></li></ol></li><li><strong>Know that whats and hows of teaching</strong><ol><li>. Although a lot of things are searchable online right now, and arguably, you can learn anything from google and/or youtube, expertise is still an important part of teaching - both the expertise in a subject matter and expertise and experience in actually teaching it.</li><li>Unfortunately, you can&rsquo;t fake expertise! Your students will know if you &ldquo;know your stuff&rdquo;.</li><li>One way to appreciate this is to think about this question: Try to compare explaining something to someone about something you are familiar with vs. something that is entirely new to you.</li><li><em>If you are to be a teacher in the future, what subject would you want to teach? How much do you know so far about the Whats and Hows of teaching that subject?</em></li></ol></li></ol><p>We cannot separate the teacher from the teaching because&mldr;</p><blockquote><p><strong>&ldquo;We teach who we are&rdquo; (Parker Palmer)</strong></p></blockquote><p>This doesn&rsquo;t mean we should change who we are, but if we are to be teachers, we must be aware of how much who we are actually affects our teaching. For example, since I became a parent, I found myself to be warmer to my students - and also eventually liking the kind of teacher I am now. <em>So, who is it that you will bring to your teaching?</em></p><a href=#your-favorite-teacher><h4 id=your-favorite-teacher><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Your favorite teacher</h4></a><p>Recall a teacher who you think was very effective. (Answer each question with a maximum of 5 sentences)</p><ol><li>What made you say that he/she was effective? (again, no need to name them, but you can situate where you encountered this teacher)</li><li>What did this teacher &ldquo;bring&rdquo; to the teaching experience?</li><li>What do you think were the factors that contributed to his/her effectivity?</li></ol><p>When I think about effective teaching, I can&rsquo;t help but think about one of my dance coaches: Coach Reflex. I&rsquo;ve been fortunate to learn from him in multiple ways: taking his P.E. Streetdance class, getting his guidance in the Company of Ateneo Dancers, and going through his personal mentorship program.</p><p>I see him as an effective teacher because of how much intention he puts into his teaching. Whenever he teaches, he always makes sure to explain why certain things need to be done; for instance: whenever he facilitates warm-up and conditioning, he explains how the exercises help you become a better dancer, such as avoiding injury. He also adapts his teaching based on the students&rsquo; background; for example: when I was personally learning breaking from him, he gave me feedback and drills that helped me &ldquo;unlearn&rdquo; the form I&rsquo;ve acquired from years of ballet + contemporary.</p><p>He brings to the teaching experience tons of expertise. He&rsquo;s already proved that he&rsquo;s a great dancer, haivng years of experience competing in various battles. However, good dancers don&rsquo;t necessarily make good teachers, and I believe he&rsquo;s also proven that he&rsquo;s qualified to teach. I see this in how he&rsquo;s constantly taking up initiatives to develop himself as an educator, such as the
<a href=https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/18039387652255529/ rel=noopener>Leadership Tools for the Dance Leader</a> program and the Adaptive Design for Learning course.</p><p>The main factors that I believe contributed to his effectivity are his personality, preferences, and beliefs; I&rsquo;ll show how these all work together with an example dear to my heart. A few days after the release of election results, I ranted on Facebook about how useless I felt my college education was, considering that many figures in our government aren&rsquo;t qualified to hold positions of power (it didn&rsquo;t help that most of my family voted for these said figures); when he saw this, he reached out to me to share his personal views. He believes education is valuable because it equip yourself with the tools you need to better yourself and your community regardless of your profession; to him, this impact matters more than letter grades (which is why he isn&rsquo;t fixated on them). He works to uphold the value of dance because of its societal impact (i.e. it pushes narratives, and inspires people in so many ways); thus, he &ldquo;pays it forward&rdquo; by teaching dance to others, digging deeply into his students. In a nutshell: his approachability, understanding, and passion are what makes him such an effecive teacher to me.</p><a href=#key-ideas-about-teacher-factors><h4 id=key-ideas-about-teacher-factors><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Key ideas about teacher factors</h4></a><p><strong>1. The why of teaching inevitably affects the hows and the whats.</strong>
<em>Why a teacher teachers and how they perceive their roles as teachers can affect how they approach the teaching process. Thus, it is important for current and future teachers to be aware of their whys.</em></p><p><strong>2. Teachers cannot be separated from the teaching.</strong>
<em>Your background, your personality, your character, etc. is something that you will inevitably bring to your teaching. What matters is to be aware about how these might help or hurt.</em></p></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li>No backlinks found</li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://garden.bianca.digital/js/graph.abd4bc2af3869a96524d7d23b76152c7.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by Bianca Aguilar using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, © 2023</p><ul><li><a href=https://garden.bianca.digital/>Home</a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/biancamikaila>Twitter</a></li><li><a href=https://are.na/bianca-aguilar>Are.na</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
