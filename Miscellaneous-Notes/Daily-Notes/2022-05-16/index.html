We experience this ==&ldquo;ought&rdquo; or &ldquo;moral imperative&rdquo;==</li><li>This ought or moral imperative is both OBJECTIVE and SUBJECTIVE<ul><li><strong>OBJECTIVE:</strong> because it&rsquo;s experienced as an imposition from the outside; one cannot change or be exempted from it, almost as though it were a physical law (e.g. gravity, sugar and dibaetes -> it being wrong to kill)</li><li><strong>SUBJECTIVE:</strong> because we recognize that the demands of this ought to correspond to and fulfill our inner desires welling from the depths of our hearts. The demands of this moral imperative is not something alien and external to ourselves; rather, they fulfill and satisfy the innermost longings of our hearts.</li></ul></li><li>Thus the claim we made earlier is that ==there&rsquo;s connaturality (connected by nature) between man and value/good==</li></ul></li><li>From VALUES to NORMS<ul><li>The externally imposed objective norms are ==expressions of values== (e.g. laws of the land, traffic regulations, code of discipline in school, people&rsquo;s tranditions)</li><li>Norms are meant to articulate, promote, protect, and enforce these values</li><li>Norms, laws, and rules arise from and are based on values</li><li>Laws and other external codes do not stand by alone; they are based on these values</li><li>As we understand these values better, and ourselves and our circs better, ==it may be necessary to amend these rules to express and protect these values better.==<ul><li>E.G. age of criminal liability, capital punishment, the earlier release of prisoners for good behavior, the protection of women and children, economic provisions of the Constitution, etc.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><a href=#the-macro-approach><h4 id=the-macro-approach><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>The &ldquo;MACRO&rdquo; Approach</h4></a><ul><li>Intro<ul><li>What I do doesn&rsquo;t remain simply on the level of the act that comes and goes. What I do, especially the acts that I do with full freedom + knowledge ==affect my &ldquo;being&rdquo;,== or as we shall argue, ==affects the direction/orientation in which I&rsquo;m moving.==</li><li>Insufficient to look at the acts alone; we need to go beyond the act to the ==actor== who remains, who is affected by the act, who is responsible for the act</li><li>The &ldquo;MICRO&rdquo; approach focuses on the dimensions of ==freedom and knowledge.== The macro approach adds the dimensions of ==person and time.==</li></ul></li><li><strong>The Dimension of the PERSON</strong> (Acts do not stand by themselves, existing in a vacuum)<ul><li>Acts ==&ldquo;belong&rdquo;== to a person. An act is imputable to a person because he is the source of the act.</li><li>Acts ==affect== the person.<ul><li>If he does a good deed and does it often, he forms a good habit, orienting him towards the good, solidifying his orientation towards the good, towards his better self.</li><li>If his act caused harm to another, he is sorry for it and would like to make reparations.</li></ul></li><li>The person gives ==&ldquo;meaning&rdquo;== to the act. While acts have general meanings, the specific meaning of an act comes from ==the actor and from his &ldquo;intention&rdquo;.==</li><li>He&rsquo;s affected by the act in another sense. A person&rsquo;s acts &ldquo;redound to his being&rdquo;; the acts contribute to the formation and development of habits (virtues) and ultimately to the kind of person he becomes.<ul><li>In another context, we said these acts orient the actor to the kind of person he&rsquo;ll become.</li></ul></li><li>The person is ultimately responsible for his acts. Before men (i.e. the law, the courts, the discipline committee, his conscience), and ultimately before God.</li><li>The person is ultimately responsible not only for his acts but for the ==kind of person he becomes.==</li><li>It&rsquo;s in this context that the authors also speak of the two level on which freedom is exercised: categorial and transcendental<ul><li>The &ldquo;object&rdquo; of categorical freedom is ==particular choices==</li><li>The object of transcendental freedom ultimately revolves around ==God and the good==: either for God or against God, for the good, against the good.</li></ul></li><li>Chronologically, particular acts are prior&mldr;through them, we eventually establish a kind of a ==fundamental orientation== towards the good (hopefully!) or towards evil.<ul><li>Orientation towards the good makes the doing of good particular acts easier; repeated particular acts strengthen and solidify our orientation towards the good.</li><li>Same applies vice versa for evil.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Dimension of TIME:</strong><ul><li>If there is a criticism we can offer to the “sin as an act” model is that it is incomplete, and therefore an inaccurate picture of reality for these reasons.<ul><li>Presents a static pictures; does not take into account that a person is a ==dynamic and progressive being==<ul><li>Progressive: a person is not necessarily the same today as he was yesterday, or a year ago, or 15 years ago when he was an adolescent and now that he is more mature, now that he knows better, and thus more responsible.</li><li>Perhaps, the “same person” was acting, and yet it is not the same person and the significance of his act is different.</li></ul></li><li>Man is in the ==process of becoming.== He is not a finished product.<ul><li>This is why we are careful about the influence of others on us</li><li>Also the reason why on the one hand, we cannot give up on ourselves as well as on others. We are becoming, we have second chances and even third chances. There is no room for despair. But this also means we are capable of deteriorating.</li></ul></li><li>Therefore, when we talk of sin, what is our area of discourse?

But it would be ==more difficult.==</li><li>What may be said about this position:<ul><li>it is possible to agree with the position stated here—that the meaning of sex is only fully respected and done virtuously in a relationship that is exclusive, committed, and open to children</li><li>while that is the ultimate goal, it is possible to engage in sex for other reasons (pleasure, experiment, testing for sexual compatibility, even love but not yet certain if committed or exclusive) for the time being, and at a later point engage in sex that fulfills its meaning in an integral way.</li><li>In fact the argument continues: it is important that we do so to try out the relationship on all levels (including sex) before committing exclusively and permanently to the other person.</li></ul></li><li>People who hold this position are in effect developing a habit of ==exercising their sexuality with incomplete meaning==—sex as an instrument of pleasure, or even an expression of love that may be genuine but not committed, and not exclusive, where sex means something less, something different.<ul><li>If we become what we repeatedly do, then we are orienting ourselves towards a certain direction, we are creating a habit that may not be that easy to reverse.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>2 &ldquo;Objections&rdquo; to this position<ul><li><strong>Why commitment?</strong><ul><li>The objection is coming from understanding love as romantic feeling—that if the feelings are gone as they inevitably will, why should I stay in the relationship?

Marriage properly speaking is ==a source of true happiness and deep fulfillment.==</li></ul></li><li><strong>But I can be committed without getting married, without that piece of paper!</strong> (What can that piece of paper add to our love so fervent and true.”)<ul><li>Via their public profession, they are proclaiming to society that this relationship is not only about themselves. ==It is something that larger society has a stake in.== It is not merely a private arrangement as BF/GF.<ul><li>The public profession of vows adds something to the relationship, something that can be a powerful support for married couples. It is recognized to be so by society, by the state, by their religious community. The bond that they create is protected by the public weal; they cannot simply walk out of their marriage.<ul><li>So yes, this &ldquo;piece of paper&rdquo; has power</li></ul></li><li>A person who makes this claim about “the piece of paper” is probably afraid of its effects, or worse, he/she probably has no intention of keeping it.</li></ul></li><li>As a committed relationship, marriage involves more than the momentary now. ==It remembers the past and celebrates a common future.==<ul><li>McCormick: ==Marriage is the best way to humanize our sexuality.== Sexual expression, to have full human meaning, to be nourishing, to avoid being trivialized, is not just about the present. As a language, it celebrates the past and guarantees the future. Sex and eros are fleeting, fickle, frustrating unless they are supported by philia and the friendship of a permanent covenant.</li><li>CCC: marriage helps to overcome self-absorption, egoism, pursuit of one one’s own pleasures, and to ==open oneself to the other in mutual self-giving.==</li><li>Ramsay: one’s capacity for responsible fidelity to the being and well-being of another makes marriage possible; man’s inclination towards selfishness and irresponsibility makes marriage (especially as a committed relationship protected by the state and society) makes marriage necessary.</li><li>Thus, while marriage celebrates the beauty of the human spirit and the heights to which it can soar, it is also intended to ==assist in protecting men and women from undue harm that can occur because of human frailty, selfishness, and irresponsibility.==</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>The Question of Masturbation</strong><ul><li>Catechism of the Catholic Church 2352:<ul><li>Masturbation is ==an intrinsically and gravely disordered act== (nature of the act)</li><li>But in order to form an equitable judgement about the person’s moral responsibility (whether it is a “sin” or nor)&mldr;</li><li>One must take into account ==his affective maturity, the force of acquired habit, conditions of anxiety and other psychological factors that may mitigate or aggravate moral responsibility.==</li></ul></li><li>CCC 2352 makes three important statements:<ul><li>Distinction between the ==nature of the act (objective)== and moral ==culpability (subjective/sin).==<ul><li>The nature of the act is disordered (not a positive value, does not contribute to the growth/development of the person)</li><li>But it&rsquo;s not clear that this is always a sin (moral culpability)<ul><li>That the person is morally responsible for the act</li><li>Or that the act necessarily affects his fundamental orientation</li><li>Or that it is a validation of an option for evil</li><li>Other factors need to be considered in order to form an equitable judgement as to whether it&rsquo;s a sin or not</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>The nature of the act is disordered, its not a positive value; it militates against the authentic human good of the person</li><li>But even if the act is disordered (the nature of the act), masturbation ==does not automatically mean that it is a sin. ==<ul><li>Killing is not a value but it is not always a sin.

According to moral theologians, the following circumstances mitigate (lessen the gravity of) moral responsibility:<ul><li>Masturbation could be expressive of a person&rsquo;s (especially an adolescent) effort ==to understand and integrate various elements of his identity as a sexual being==</li><li>Masturbation can also be ==symptomatic of many non-sexual conflicts== (e.g. boredom, poor self-image, frustration, loneliness)</li><li>Masturbation can point to ==&ldquo;unfinishedness&rdquo;==: the incomplete process of growth and development of a person.<ul><li>To be unfinished (man on the way to becoming, the element of time) is not immoral or irresponsible, ==it is to be challenged to further growth. ==</li><li>But one must not choose to remain there or to prefer to be “unfinished”.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Responsible Parenthood and the Regulation of Birth</strong><ul><li>Biological Introduction<ul><li>Essentially, the <strong>natural</strong> method of contraception builds on the biological fact that the woman is not always fertile.<ul><li>Natural contraception means timing the intercourse between husband and wife during the periods of natural infertility of the wife.</li><li>The difficulty associated with the natural method is determining with greater accuracy when is the woman infertile.</li></ul></li><li>The <strong>artificial</strong> methods are classified: surgical [vasectomy, ligation], chemical [spermicide, pills], physical barriers [condom].</li></ul></li><li><strong>Moral Evaluation</strong><ul><li><strong>Casti connubii</strong> [Pius X, 1932]<ul><li>Augustine&rsquo;s view (in order to see the radicalness of the doctrine proposed in CC)<ul><li>Concupiscent sex, that is to say, sexual intercourse that is not for procreation is sinful.
