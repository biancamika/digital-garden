Examples of reasons why children would show narcissistic injury due to perfectionism include failing exams, losing in competitions, being denied acceptance, disagreement in conversation with others, and constructive criticism. <ul><li><a href=/Permanent-Notes/Perfectionism rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Permanent-Notes/Perfectionism>Permanent Notes/Perfectionism</a></li><li><a href=/Permanent-Notes/The-False-Self rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Permanent-Notes/The-False-Self>Permanent Notes/The False Self</a></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Black Swan (Nina as Narcissus)<ul><li><a href=https://lechatdargent.wordpress.com/2011/02/14/weeping-for-narcissus-a-review-of-black-swan/ rel=noopener>Weeping for Narcissus</a><ul><li>The essence of narcissistic injury is this: a person naturally grows their own sense of who they are, and seeks love and approval from important others. ==The narcissistic injury occurs when the important others attack that home-grown sense of self, and demand that an external standard be achieved instead.== So, natural sense of self is rejected as sub-standard; external sense of what self should be is imposed.<ul><li><a href=/Permanent-Notes/The-False-Self rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Permanent-Notes/The-False-Self>Permanent Notes/The False Self</a> v.s. <a href=/Permanent-Notes/The-True-Self rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Permanent-Notes/The-True-Self>Permanent Notes/The True Self</a></li></ul></li><li>Consequently, the narcissistic injury drives a ==perfectionism== that is un-natural (because it doesn’t actually fit with what the person wants ‘in their heart of hearts’), and can never be satisfied (because the external standard is alien, so any success can’t truly be felt as belonging to self).<ul><li><a href=/Permanent-Notes/Perfectionism rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Permanent-Notes/Perfectionism>Permanent Notes/Perfectionism</a></li></ul></li><li>In the Greek myth, the beautiful young man Narcissus is cursed by the Gods to fall in love with his own reflection; but he doesn’t know he is in love with his reflection, he takes his reflection to be another person. That is the tragedy of ==narcissistically driven ambition==; the person who is so driven doesn’t realise they are chasing their own reflection, which they are doomed never to attain, however successful they are.</li><li>Applied to Nina, her injury is clear; she needs to be the Swan Queen to feel worthwhile because, in her narcissistically driven emotional reality, there are only two categories: ==perfection and worthlessness.== Incidentally, this dichotomy of perfection and worthlessness plays itself out well between Nina and Beth; the former’s star rising as the latter’s descends.<ul><li>A binary way of seeing the world&mldr; <a href=/Permanent-Notes/Absolute-Certainty-versus-Wonder rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Permanent-Notes/Absolute-Certainty-versus-Wonder>Permanent Notes/Absolute Certainty versus Wonder</a></li></ul></li><li>The influence of Nina’s mother sits heavily in the background, and it is striking that the film doesn’t make an overly big deal out of this. It is simply presented as the way things are, meaning that the full impact and implications of Nina’s homelife aren’t over played.<ul><li>Damn same</li></ul></li><li>There are no characters, <em>even those whose approval Nina is seeking</em> that have an effective existence independently of Nina. Consider that as an ==emotional reality; one in which people only exist in the context of your own goals.== That is part of the trap of narcissistic relating; Nina only ever relates to her own reflection, never the actual people she meets. That is true not only of the other girls in the company, but also director Thomas, and Nina’s mother; the two people whose approval Nina so desperately seeks.<ul><li>Related to the <a href=/Permanent-Notes/Ressentiment rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Permanent-Notes/Ressentiment>Permanent Notes/Ressentiment</a> I experience?</li></ul></li><li>Consequently, it isn’t possible for Nina to receive human nourishment because at no point is she in contact with another person; she relates only to her own reflection. And reflection is a great way of explaining what happens when we project unwanted aspects of ourselves onto others; the other becomes a pool of water, upon the surface of which we see something of ourselves without recognising it as such.

As William Miller (1991, p. 39) states, “Projection is an unconscious mechanism that is employed whenever a trait or characteristic of our personality that has no relation to consciousness becomes activated. As a result of the unconscious projection, we observe and react to this unrecognized personal trait in other people. We see in them something that is part of ourselves, but which we fail to see in ourselves.” Furthermore, “…anytime our response to another person involves excessive emotion or overreaction, we can be sure that something unconscious has been prodded and is being activated (Miller 1991, p. 40)<ul><li><a class="internal-link broken">Authenticity</a> and <a href=/Permanent-Notes/Brokenness rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Permanent-Notes/Brokenness>Permanent Notes/Brokenness</a>: shadow self</li><li><a href=/Permanent-Notes/Ressentiment rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Permanent-Notes/Ressentiment>Permanent Notes/Ressentiment</a></li></ul></li><li>Psychoanalyst

The studies showed that narcissistic performers are visionary and inspirational (Campbell, et al, 2011). Many times the society adores, watches, follows and loves them because they are determined and selfassured leaders (Dionne and Davis, 2012: 135-140). Their courage on risk-taking (Brunell and Buelow, 2017: 3-14) is interesting and exciting to watch because normal and standard actions are safe but boring. Thus it can be concluded that the society forces performers to be narcissistic to some extent, since performers should be applauded, liked, admired and gone after. ==If performers do not adore their own selves, nobody does==</li><li>The theory that low narcissistic individuals do not try hard to prove themselves to anybody and do not use self-enhancement opportunities (Wallace and Baumeister, 2002) strengthens the idea that narcissism brings success. It can be concluded that if narcissistic performers face negative feedback, sarcasm or criticism, they can get angry, frustrated and disappointed. Since the reaction was seen as an ego-threat, they can see this as an opportunity to prove their future success and work harder. Moreover, the study of Martinsen points out that narcissists have creative personalities and strong motivation (Martinsen et al, 2019: 166-171). This fact enables narcissistic stage performers to be more successful since stage is a creative working area. The coworkers and the audience of narcissists would be excited, and appreciate creativity and motivation which contribute a lot to the performance.</li></ul></li></ul><a href=#outline><h4 id=outline><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Outline</h4></a><a href=#draft-1><h6 id=draft-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Draft 1</h6></a><ol><li>Let&rsquo;s start with the surface &ndash; my relationship with dance and its effects on me<ol><li><a href=/Permanent-Notes/Disordered-attachments rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Permanent-Notes/Disordered-attachments>Permanent Notes/Disordered attachments</a>: I have a disordered attachment to dance</li><li><a href=/Permanent-Notes/Pusillanimity rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Permanent-Notes/Pusillanimity>Permanent Notes/Pusillanimity</a>: This relationship is leading me to live a small life<ol><li>Self-love: the warped kind&mldr;it&rsquo;s narcissism<ol><li>Narcissism is a personality trait that exists on a spectrum.

2. If we treat the question “Who am I?” as a problem, we answer with our tangibles. But if we treat “Who am I?” as a mystery, we acknowledge that there is more to us than this constructed persona.
2. This is more than just a relationship with dance. What I&rsquo;m really talking about here is my relationship with myself.
