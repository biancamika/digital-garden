Examples of reasons why children would show narcissistic injury due to perfectionism include failing exams, losing in competitions, being denied acceptance, disagreement in conversation with others, and constructive criticism. <ul><li><a href=/Cards/Perfectionism rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Cards/Perfectionism>Cards/Perfectionism</a></li><li><a href=/Cards/The-False-Self rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Cards/The-False-Self>Cards/The False Self</a></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Black Swan (Nina as Narcissus)<ul><li><a href=https://lechatdargent.wordpress.com/2011/02/14/weeping-for-narcissus-a-review-of-black-swan/ rel=noopener>Weeping for Narcissus</a><ul><li>The essence of narcissistic injury is this: a person naturally grows their own sense of who they are, and seeks love and approval from important others. ==The narcissistic injury occurs when the important others attack that home-grown sense of self, and demand that an external standard be achieved instead.== So, natural sense of self is rejected as sub-standard; external sense of what self should be is imposed.<ul><li><a href=/Cards/The-False-Self rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Cards/The-False-Self>Cards/The False Self</a> v.s. <a href=/Cards/The-True-Self rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Cards/The-True-Self>Cards/The True Self</a></li></ul></li><li>Consequently, the narcissistic injury drives a ==perfectionism== that is un-natural (because it doesn’t actually fit with what the person wants ‘in their heart of hearts’), and can never be satisfied (because the external standard is alien, so any success can’t truly be felt as belonging to self).<ul><li><a href=/Cards/Perfectionism rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Cards/Perfectionism>Cards/Perfectionism</a></li></ul></li><li>In the Greek myth, the beautiful young man Narcissus is cursed by the Gods to fall in love with his own reflection; but he doesn’t know he is in love with his reflection, he takes his reflection to be another person. That is the tragedy of ==narcissistically driven ambition==; the person who is so driven doesn’t realise they are chasing their own reflection, which they are doomed never to attain, however successful they are.</li><li>Applied to Nina, her injury is clear; she needs to be the Swan Queen to feel worthwhile because, in her narcissistically driven emotional reality, there are only two categories: ==perfection and worthlessness.== Incidentally, this dichotomy of perfection and worthlessness plays itself out well between Nina and Beth; the former’s star rising as the latter’s descends.<ul><li>A binary way of seeing the world&mldr; <a href=/Cards/Absolute-Certainty-versus-Wonder rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Cards/Absolute-Certainty-versus-Wonder>Cards/Absolute Certainty versus Wonder</a></li></ul></li><li>The influence of Nina’s mother sits heavily in the background, and it is striking that the film doesn’t make an overly big deal out of this.

Consider that as an ==emotional reality; one in which people only exist in the context of your own goals.== That is part of the trap of narcissistic relating; Nina only ever relates to her own reflection, never the actual people she meets.

<a class="internal-link broken">Do not let the perfect be the enemy of the good</a></li></ul></li><li>This brings us to Nina’s mother.  Again, we are not witnesses to the actual factors that would have resulted in Nina’s pathological narcissism.  But narcissism tends to breed narcissism, and most pathological narcissists have at least one narcissistic parent.  (Vanknin, p. 493.)<ul><li><em>“The narcissistic parent regards his or her child as a multi-faceted source of Narcissistic Supply.  The child is considered to be and treated as an extension of the narcissistic parent.  It is though the child of the narcissist seeks to settle ‘open scores’ with the world.  This child is supposed to realize the unfulfilled dreams, wishes, and fantasies of the narcissistic parent.”</em> (Vanknin, p. 493.)</li></ul></li><li>The narcissistic parent’s ==exercise of control== over her child helps sustain the illusion that ==the child is part of the narcissistic parent==, and that control can be guilt-driven (e.g., the reminder that her mother quit dancing at age 28 to have Nina) and goal-driven (e.g., providing “advice” on how to handle the audition process for the Swan Queen).  (Vanknin, p. 493.)  In this regard, Nina’s mother maintains Nina in a state of arrested development within a 12 year-old girl’s bedroom, refuses to acknowledge or inform Nina of callers, and drags Nina to the bathroom to trim her nails when it appears she may be hurting herself (rather than dragging her to a professional).<ul><li><a class="internal-link broken">The Challenge to Love</a>: the taking form of existence</li></ul></li><li>The doppelgänger of <em>Black Swan</em> is a manifestation of a more general aspect of narcissism – <em>self-objectification.</em></li><li>And then comes the break.  As a particular type of narcissist—socially inept in her obsession with technical precision—Nina’s ==False Self== fits neatly with the performances of the corps demanded of her in the past and the expectations for the White Swan.  But in Thomas’ interpretation of <em>Swan Lake</em>, portraying the Black Swan requires a certain “letting go” and a “seduction,” which are ==ill-suited to the False Self Nina has so carefully crafted and honed.  Nina needs a new False Self to pull off the perfection she seeks.==  If the <em>vertical</em> split of her psyche between her True Self and her False Self (pathological narcissism) occurred before we first met Nina, the <em>horizontal</em> split of her False Self between the White Swan and the Black Swan (schizophrenia) ultimately proves to be her undoing.  As expressed visually in the final performance, that horizontal split dramatizes—or gives an added dimension to—the vertical split.<ul><li><a href=/Cards/The-False-Self rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Cards/The-False-Self>Cards/The False Self</a> as a mask (<a href=/Sources/Images-of-Integrity-Across-the-Great-Divide rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Sources/Images-of-Integrity-Across-the-Great-Divide>Sources/Images of Integrity - Across the Great Divide</a>)</li></ul></li><li>That is, beyond the vanity inherent in <em>reflection</em>, Aronofsky provides yet another separate (but related) motif to emphasize ==the <em>duality</em> of the True Self and the False Self that characterizes the narcissist.== But that duality <em>also</em> extends beyond Nina to the other artists and performers. What Aronofsky has to say about the fractured narcissistic psyche seems to apply in a more general sense.  What does it really take (psychologically speaking) to be an elite artist/performer?  What kind of person would sign up for that?  And would we all really want to be inside that headspace?</li><li>In <em>The Red Shoes</em>, Julian is distinctly desexualized, and the force countering the pursuit of Vicky’s art is romantic love and a future with marriage and a family.  In contrast, Thomas unapologetically links sex to Nina’s performance (on and off the stage), and ==Nina is bound by the demands of her own False Self and confined to a self-imposed state of arrested development.==  If <em>The Red Shoes</em> questions the effect of the relentless pursuit of artistic ambition on an otherwise talented and emotionally healthy person, <em>Black Swan</em> challenges its underlying assumption in the context of a much larger world – that is, ==<em>can a talented and emotionally healthy person being even achieve that level of success?</em>==<ul><li><a href=/Cards/The-False-Self rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Cards/The-False-Self>Cards/The False Self</a></li><li><a href=/Cards/Perfectionism rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Cards/Perfectionism>Cards/Perfectionism</a></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><a href=https://girlswhothink.wordpress.com/2011/01/18/black-swan-some-thoughts-on-perfection-narcissism-and-the-shadow/ rel=noopener>https://girlswhothink.wordpress.com/2011/01/18/black-swan-some-thoughts-on-perfection-narcissism-and-the-shadow/</a><ul><li>As a psychotherapist, my perspective is grounded in psychological theories of attachment and of processes in the unconscious, and ==Nina’s pursuit of perfection is, in my eyes, deeply connected to her traumatic relationship with her mother and with herself.==</li><li>Nina’s very fragile sense of self was apparent to me right from the start of the film.  Portman plays Nina as strangely child-like while at home with her mother, and anxious, eager to acheive, and tightly emotionally constricted in public.  ==Nina is a narcissist, a person whose entire sense of self relies on the reflection she receives from others, rather than from her own internal sense of who she is.  Her identity relies on pleasing others by being perfect in the ways that she was taught to define herself==: with her precision of dance technique, her hard work and devotion to dance, her thin body, her sexual purity, her devotion and obedience to her mother, and her maintenance of her role as the “sweet girl” child figure.<ul><li><a href=/Cards/The-False-Self rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Cards/The-False-Self>Cards/The False Self</a> defined by <a href=/Cards/Tangibles rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Cards/Tangibles>Cards/Tangibles</a></li><li>Lack of <a href=/Cards/The-True-Self rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Cards/The-True-Self>Cards/The True Self</a></li></ul></li><li>Narcissism develops when a baby doesn’t get enough mirroring and attunement from her parent/caregiver. Instead of the parent watching their child to reflect back and validate emotions and facial expressions, the parent looks to the child for a reassuring reflection and attunement, and the child learns that she needs to meet the parent’s needs instead of vice-versa.  It can create the feeling that love is conditional on the child being a certain way.  Children are biologically programmed to love their parents, and to know that they depend on this love for their own survival.  So the child immediately catches on– <em>I exist for my parent.  I am– I have to be– what my parent needs me to be</em>.  A false self that is based entirely on approval, and composed of the qualities demanded (overtly or subtly) by the parent, is what develops.  All other parts of the child are repressed, and a real self is never created.  There is a feeling of being unseen.  The child, and the adult that that child becomes, has no ego… and therefore all that can develop is an inflated, grandiose self, or a kind of depressed nothingness.</li><li>Nina certainly has some of that inflated self– her dogged pursuit of perfection (in her dance, in her prissy attitude, in her eating disorder) shows us that.  And when we see more and more of Nina’s interactions with her mother, we get an idea of how she may have learned to lean so heavily on this idea of perfection rather than on her own imperfect humanness. We immediately see numerous subtle and not-so-subtle methods that her mother uses to control her– and we can only conclude that this control has gone on throughout Nina’s life.  We don’t have a hard time figuring out that Nina’s sense of self had to be constructed by her mother’s expectations, and that Nina probably never had a lot of room to become her own person. To her mother, Nina is not an individual, a person in her own right– Nina is only an expression or reflection of her mother. (The numerous paintings of Nina in her mother’s studio give us some indication of the degree to which Nina’s mother is enmeshed/obsessed with Nina.)</li><li>Certain human qualities are not acceptable for her to have.  She begins to repress them, to stuff them down into a little box deep inside of her.  Her need to be separate, her desire for recognition that she doesn’t have to share with her mother, her need to grow, her sexual self, her desire to ever be anything other than perfect… all of these get stuffed into that box.  Along with those unacceptable qualities and desires also go the feelings that she can’t express– like her anger, her hatred of her mother, and her aggression– and all the fantasies that go along with them.  Imagine all of that stuff together, packed in tightly.  It leaks out a little bit in everyday life, but only unconsciously, in the form of (arguably, socially acceptable) aggression against herself and her body, such as vomiting up meals and dancing past her physical limit.</li><li>It’s pretty normal for an artist to try to access or embody different parts of themselves in order to immerse themselves in an artistic process.  But Nina’s false self is so fragile and so restricted that she can’t access any different parts without that box full of shadow pieces spilling its guts.</li><li>She can’t express any of these feelings directly– she can’t discuss them or sublimate them into her dance or even develop a conscious awareness of them.  The hallucinations serve to express her disturbance, and simultaneously they protect her from the trauma of consciously acknowledging it.  But slowly they take her over more and more.  We don’t know whether Nina really dies at the end of the movie or not, but I can certainly believe that her self-destructiveness would go that far.  There was no more self-control or self-directedness in her anymore… her mind was taken over by her anxiety and her disturbance, and led forward (to finish the dance) by that still strong desire for perfection, that yearning to be lovable.<ul><li><a href=/Cards/Ressentiment rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Cards/Ressentiment>Cards/Ressentiment</a></li><li><a href=/Cards/Desire rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Cards/Desire>Cards/Desire</a> to be loved</li></ul></li><li>A person who learns to stifle herself in the pursuit of perfection is a person who has been taught ==“I’m not lovable on my own, as the person I am separate from my accomplishments.”==  I thought that Black Swan was a beautiful illustration of this idea, played out to its extreme.<ul><li><a href=/Cards/Perfectionism rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Cards/Perfectionism>Cards/Perfectionism</a></li><li><a href=/Cards/Tangibles rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Cards/Tangibles>Cards/Tangibles</a></li><li><a href=/Cards/Self-rejection rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Cards/Self-rejection>Cards/Self-rejection</a></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><a href="https://sobider.com/?mod=tammetin&makaleadi=&makaleurl=371b840f-c7e5-4898-ac59-7ad258277bb8.pdf&key=40557" rel=noopener>Shining on the Stage: Narcissism and the Performing Arts</a><ul><li>Performers should distinguish between an ==inner self and a commercial self== in order to eliminate the harmful effects of narcissism and to have a more peaceful and healthy performing life</li><li>Stage performers generally tend to have narcissistic personal traits. The studies showed that narcissistic performers are visionary and inspirational (Campbell, et al, 2011). Many times the society adores, watches, follows and loves them because they are determined and selfassured leaders (Dionne and Davis, 2012: 135-140). Their courage on risk-taking (Brunell and Buelow, 2017: 3-14) is interesting and exciting to watch because normal and standard actions are safe but boring. Thus it can be concluded that the society forces performers to be narcissistic to some extent, since performers should be applauded, liked, admired and gone after. ==If performers do not adore their own selves, nobody does==</li><li>The theory that low narcissistic individuals do not try hard to prove themselves to anybody and do not use self-enhancement opportunities (Wallace and Baumeister, 2002) strengthens the idea that narcissism brings success. It can be concluded that if narcissistic performers face negative feedback, sarcasm or criticism, they can get angry, frustrated and disappointed. Since the reaction was seen as an ego-threat, they can see this as an opportunity to prove their future success and work harder. Moreover, the study of Martinsen points out that narcissists have creative personalities and strong motivation (Martinsen et al, 2019: 166-171). This fact enables narcissistic stage performers to be more successful since stage is a creative working area. The coworkers and the audience of narcissists would be excited, and appreciate creativity and motivation which contribute a lot to the performance.</li></ul></li></ul><a href=#outline><h4 id=outline><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Outline</h4></a><a href=#draft-1><h6 id=draft-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Draft 1</h6></a><ol><li>Let&rsquo;s start with the surface &ndash; my relationship with dance and its effects on me<ol><li><a href=/Cards/Disordered-attachments rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Cards/Disordered-attachments>Cards/Disordered attachments</a>: I have a disordered attachment to dance</li><li><a href=/Cards/Pusillanimity rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Cards/Pusillanimity>Cards/Pusillanimity</a>: This relationship is leading me to live a small life<ol><li>Self-love: the warped kind&mldr;it&rsquo;s narcissism<ol><li>Narcissism is a personality trait that exists on a spectrum.

2. If we treat the question “Who am I?” as a problem, we answer with our tangibles. But if we treat “Who am I?” as a mystery, we acknowledge that there is more to us than this constructed persona.
2. This is more than just a relationship with dance. What I&rsquo;m really talking about here is my relationship with myself.
1. Dance is a representation of external validation&mldr;.success
3. My identity
2. <a href=/Cards/Tangibles rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Cards/Tangibles>Cards/Tangibles</a>
1. What I do: I&rsquo;m a dancer
2. What I have: teams, accomplishments, etc.
3. What people say I am: how &ldquo;good enough&rdquo; I am
3. <a href=/Cards/The-False-Self rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Cards/The-False-Self>Cards/The False Self</a>: Bianca the dancer may be part of me, but it is not who I truly am
4. I need to discover who I truly am
1. <a href=/Cards/The-True-Self rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Cards/The-True-Self>Cards/The True Self</a>: I need to connect with this
2. <a href=/Cards/Brokenness rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Cards/Brokenness>Cards/Brokenness</a>: And I can only find this if I get in touch with my trauma. What is the hole dance is filling in my life?
