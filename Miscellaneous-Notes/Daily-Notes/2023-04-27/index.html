He lives day-to-day, doing the tasks which he feels are expected of him but does not seem to feel any true emotion. He is not sure why he does what he does and does not realize his actions can have destructive consequences.</li><li><strong>Trigger warning</strong>: This novel has violence and destruction of others and self. Unlike <em>Brave New World,</em> which is set in a world very different from our own, Meursault&rsquo;s world is highly relatable. Its systems are literally our systems and the lives of the characters are very similar to our lives. Because of this, Meursault may feel eerily like us. But his choices should not be our choices. As you read, bear in mind that <strong>the destruction of others and the self is NOT an option</strong>.</li><li>Here are some questions to help anchor your reading:<ul><li>Why does Meursault live the way he does? How would you describe his &ldquo;style&rdquo; of living?</li><li>Is he making choices or are circumstances acting upon him?</li><li>Is he a nice person? Why is he likeable enough?</li><li>When he commits his act of violence, is it out of a personal choice? Or was he being acted upon by circumstances?</li><li>Is he conscious of making choices and decisions?</li><li>Are you sympathetic?</li></ul></li><li>Before you proceed, watch
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPtzpjC7TF4" rel=noopener>this short video on Camus&rsquo;s philosophy of the absurd.</a><ul><li>&ldquo;If the world were clear, art would not exist.&rdquo; - <a class="internal-link broken">Albert Camus</a>, &ldquo;The Myth of Sisyphus: Absurd Creation&rdquo; <a class="internal-link broken">Art would not exist in a clear world</a></li><li>Coming from a background of violence, Camus pondered: &ldquo;If the world was meaningless, could our individual lives still hold value?&rdquo;</li><li><a class="internal-link broken">Existentialism</a><ul><li>Existentialists believed people were born as blank slates, each responsible for creating their life&rsquo;s meaning amidst a chaotic world</li><li>All people were born with a shared human nature that bonded them towards common goals</li><li>One such meaning was to seek out meaning despite the world&rsquo;s arbitrary cruelty</li><li>Camus viewed <strong>humanity&rsquo;s desire for meaning</strong> and <strong>the universe&rsquo;s silent indifference</strong> as two incompatible puzzle pieces, and considered trying to fit them together to be fundamentally absurd. This tension became the heart of Camus&rsquo; Philosophy of the Absurd (<a class="internal-link broken">Absurdity</a>), which argued that life is inherently futile.</li><li>Exploring how to live life without meaning became the guiding question behind Camus&rsquo; early work, which he called the <strong>&ldquo;cycle of the absurd&rdquo;</strong></li></ul></li></ul></li><li>The video explains to us that to Camus, life is essentially meaningless. Hence, it&rsquo;s absurd. But, the destruction of self is not an option. ==As life is meaningless, then even more so, we exercise our freedom to actually FIND meaning or CHOOSE to live a life of meaning.==</li><li>Question: Given Camus&rsquo;s philosophy of finding meaning in absurdity, did Meursault die happy? Why or why not?</li></ul><a href=#how-to-live-in-the-face-of-absurdity><h4 id=how-to-live-in-the-face-of-absurdity><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>How to live in the face of absurdity?</h4></a><ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Idhb8OVDCM" rel=noopener>7 Life Lessons from Albert Camus</a></li></ul><a href=#module-4-the-modern-condition><h3 id=module-4-the-modern-condition><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Module 4: The modern condition</h3></a><a href=#revisiting><h4 id=revisiting><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Revisiting</h4></a><ul><li>So far, in this course, we have explored the modernist concepts of <em>alienation, fragmentation, absurdity</em>, as well as issues of <em>finding the self</em> and <em>finding meaning.</em> We have also explored how our economic and political systems have had very challenging effects on the individual and our sense of ourselves. In our novel for module 4, which is the very suspenseful yet very moving <em>Patron saints of nothing</em> by Filipino-American Randy Ribay, we get to explore these same concepts as they are expressed in contemporary times.</li><li>Before we begin, though, it is important to make a distinction between what &ldquo;modern&rdquo; means and what &ldquo;contemporary&rdquo; means. <ul><li><em>Modern</em>, as I&rsquo;ve defined in this class, is more ==a way of seeing or a way of perceiving, just as it is a way of be-ing.== In which case, &ldquo;modern&rdquo; is not attached to any real time frame (although the sensibility has been more marked after the industrial revolution).</li><li>&ldquo;Contemporary&rdquo;, though, means &ldquo;this same time&rdquo;. In other words, &ldquo;contemporary&rdquo; is not a sensibility or way of perceiving or being. Rather, it refers to ==a specific time, analogous to our lives today.== <em>Patron saints of nothing</em>, then, is a contemporary novel as it was published in 2019, pretty much during this time, this generation, that we are in.</li></ul></li><li>As we read and discuss this novel, pay close attention to how the modern concepts we have discussed play out in the lives of the characters of the novel.</li></ul><a href=#hyphens><h4 id=hyphens><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Hyphens</h4></a><ul><li>The novel begins with the dedication, &ldquo;for the hyphenated&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s an interesting audience to dedicate a book too as what is a <em>hyphenated</em> person anyway? Let&rsquo;s explore this a bit.</li><li>When we hyphenate a word, we connect two words to make them one. Or, we connect two concepts to make them one. But, when a hyphenated word is written down, we see the two distinct words and the hyphen that somehow connected them. The connection is necessary because there may not be a word for the concept that is expressed by two words hyphenated together. So, a hyphenated concept would be one that is composed of two distinct concepts, made into one, but the two concepts do not blur into the other. Rather, ==they remain distinct but unified. Or unified in their distinct-ness.==</li><li>Considering this brief analysis of what a &ldquo;hyphenated&rdquo; concept could be, who do you think the book, <em>Patron saints of nothing</em>, is dedicated to? What could be an <em>hyphenated</em> person? Feel free to also explore other ideas on what &lsquo;hyphenated&rsquo; means!</li></ul><a href=#answer><h5 id=answer><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Answer</h5></a><p>In my eyes, I believe that Filipino culture is inherently hypenated. Due to our centuries-long history with colonization (e.g. Spanish, Japanese, Americans), our culture is a mixing pot of international influences, and it&rsquo;s impossible to imagine Filipino culture without them. And this struggle with being hypenated is expressed most in our colonial mentality: the internalized belief that we are inferior to our colonizers.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve experienced this in how I learned languages. Growing up, I was taught English first instead of Filipino. While this allowed me to speak English with complete mastery, my Filipino suffered. It doesn&rsquo;t help that I went to a high school that mainly taught in English, and that English is considered a native language in the Philippines. Because of this, I always felt insecure about my identity; how can I claim I&rsquo;m Filipino when I&rsquo;m not good at speaking the language?</p><a href=#fragmentation><h4 id=fragmentation><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span><a class="internal-link broken">Fragmentation</a></h4></a><ul><li>The related concepts of <em>fragmentation</em> and <em>alienation</em> are visible in the novel. Between the two, <em>fragmentation</em> is more clearly connected with the idea of a hyphenated person as ==this kind of identity would have different, distinct fragments, that make the whole.== So, some questions to think about:<ul><li>How are the characters in the novel made up of distinct parts that may &lsquo;battle&rsquo; with each other? And how are these parts, no matter how distinct or in conflict, making up a whole? </li><li>What are the causes for fragmentation that you see with the characters? There may be different causes for each one. </li><li>Would you say that fragmentation is an essential element of who each character is?</li></ul></li><li>But when we think of fragmentation, we also need to consider that ==societies can be fragmented as well.== We can ask similar questions about societies/cultures:<ul><li>How are the societies/cultures of the novel composed of fragments? What seems to be &lsquo;wholes&rsquo; of these societies/cultures? And what are the fragments? What causes the fragments?</li><li>How are these fragments an important characteristic of these societies/cultures?</li></ul></li><li>And then, we can also think of fragmentation as ==visible in our lives== today:<ul><li>How are you fragmented? How do these fragments seem to struggle against each other? What enabled these fragments? How is your own identity the total of &lsquo;warring&rsquo; parts?</li><li>How are our lives and societies fragmented today?</li><li>How do fragments shine through?</li></ul></li></ul><a href=#answer-1><h5 id=answer-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Answer</h5></a><p>Fragmentation is also expressed in my identity as a polymath. I have multiple passions &ndash; design, dance, education &ndash; and I want to pursue them all! These fragments shine by making me more unique; in an increasingly competitive world, being a T-shaped person (someone who has one speciality, but also has a range of related skills) will get you far in life. Unfortunately, having multiple interests as a polymath can also be a struggle, because there is only so much you can do with your limited time and energy. I often burn myself out because I always want to do everything; learning how to discern and focus was a hard but necessary skill for me.</p><a href=#alienation><h4 id=alienation><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span><a class="internal-link broken">Alienation</a></h4></a><ul><li>Aside from fragmentation, the characters of the novel experience various expressions of <em>alienation.</em> We can start examining alienation through our main character whose diasporic (Philippine-American) heritage makes him both fragmented and alienated. But apart from his heritage, there are other forms of alienation that he experiences, which involve his family, friends, the society he lives in. So some questions to as:<ul><li>how is Jake both fragmented and alienated?</li><li>how do the conditions of fragmentation and alienation contribute to his overall personhood?</li><li>what factors lead to the alienation he experiences?</li></ul></li><li>But aside from Jake, we get the sense that other characters are alienated too! How do other characters experience alienation? Are they alienated from themselves and others? From family? What factors lead to the alienation?</li></ul><a href=#answer-2><h5 id=answer-2><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Answer</h5></a><ul><li>Tito Manny?</li></ul><a href=#absurdity-and-meaning><h4 id=absurdity-and-meaning><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Absurdity and meaning</h4></a><ul><li>Are there any indications in the novel on the meaninglessness of life? Any incidents that seem so absurd to you?</li><li>But, at the same time, does the novel have anything to say about how meaning and happiness can be found?</li><li>Let&rsquo;s talk about Jake. How does he seem to be carving a sense of meaning for himself? How does a longing for meaning shape the decisions he makes? What about the other characters? Are they finding meaning? How? Or are they just coasting along? </li><li>What factors make it difficult for all the characters to find meaning?</li><li>What makes it difficult for YOU to find meaning?</li></ul><a href=#answer-3><h5 id=answer-3><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Answer</h5></a><a href=#self-knowledge><h4 id=self-knowledge><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Self-knowledge</h4></a><ul><li>Jung reminds us about how hard it is to look deep inside ourselves to find ourselves. How is the journey toward self-knowledge critical in the conflicts that you see in the novel, particularly those that have to do with Jun and Jake? From these two characters, what do we understand about the terrifying but wonderful journey toward self-knowledge?</li><li>What factors also get in the way of self-knowledge?</li><li>What about the other characters? Have they found themselves?</li><li>What about you?

In this version, the actor, Viggo Mortensen, reads it. It&rsquo;s called &ldquo;The Crisis of Man&rdquo;. I know the title is inappropriately gendered but let&rsquo;s give it to Camus who was writing from a different time. But, do pay attention to how Camus&rsquo;s ideas still remain important today.

Would that be selfish, do you think? How is the idea of responsibility for others reconciled with an inward-looking perspective?

I hope you enjoyed the course as much as I enjoyed teaching it. What I would like you to remember as we end this course is all this fragmentation, alienation, absurdity, the pain of the journey to self are inevitable. They are part of living in this mortal coil of ours. But, even as much as all these are an inevitable part of truly finding ourselves, there is a part of them that arises from the unjust material conditions we find ourselves with. So, as you face the rest of your lives, consider how you can help everyone on their journeys to self and how you can make conditions less harsh and more enabling.</p><a href=#historical-and-philosophical-foundations-of-education><h2 id=historical-and-philosophical-foundations-of-education><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Historical and Philosophical Foundations of Education</h2></a><p>#EDUC101i #education #history #philosophy</p><a href=#reflection><h3 id=reflection><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Reflection</h3></a><a href=#questions><h4 id=questions><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Questions</h4></a><ol><li>What is your own Philosophy of Education?
