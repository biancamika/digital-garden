To him, education and religion were inseparable; gaining an education helped people to build God&rsquo;s kingdom on earth.</li><li>The purpose of education was to fulfill <strong>the 12 Human Desires</strong>:<ul><li>To live</li><li>To have an enduring healthy life</li><li>To know one&rsquo;s surroundings, that is, a perceptive life</li><li>To have understanding, that is, an enlightened life</li><li>To have a life of freedom, that is, to wish and choose what one understands to be good and to refuse and reject the evil</li><li>To have an active life</li><li>To have and hold many possessions</li><li>To enjoy the use of property with a sense of security</li><li>To live an honorable life</li><li>To be able to communicate with others effectively</li><li>To have a peaceful life</li><li>To have eternal life</li></ul></li><li>Comenius called life <strong>The School of God&rsquo;s Wisdom.</strong> This was divided into three different schools:<ul><li>The Physical School: consisted of the book of nature or the physical world around us.

Here, people would use their mind and reason to analyze and discover complex concepts.</li><li>The Hyperphysical School: dealt with things of God as found in the Holy Scriptures.

other words was the worldgetting better</li><li>Rousseau experiencedsomething of an epiphany it struck himthat civilization and progress had notin fact improved people instead they had enacted a terrible destructiveinfluence on the morality of humanbeings who had once been good</li><li>Russa tookthis insight and turned it into thecentral thesis of what became hiscelebrated discourse on the Arts andSciences</li><li>his argument was simpleindividuals had once been good and happybut as people had emerged from their presocial state and joined society they hadbecome plagued by vice and sin</li><li>thatRousseau thought had corrupted peopleand led to moral degeneracy Rousseauclaimed that the march towardcivilization had awakened in people anunhealthy form of self-love a more pophe

had begun to comparethemselves to others and created theiridentities solely by reference to theirneighbors civilized people had stoppedthinking about what they wanted and theyfelt and merely imitated

aboutnature it&rsquo;s not justnature meaning what you see outside liketrees the environment but also thenature of a personthatthey use this particular notion to shapetheir particular

to begin to recognize thateveryone is fundamentally good or atleast that&rsquo;s what they believed in andsince everyone is fundamentally goodif the goal of education is to shape agood personthen the

opposed many existing paradigms and practices in education:<ol><li>&ldquo;Education as a procedure to be <em>imposed</em> from without&rdquo;</li><li>Specialization: Education aimed at <em>producing</em> workers, citizens, and members of society. &ldquo;Education, in making a worker or a citizen, made him less a man.&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;The child is <em>not to be swaddled</em>,

(Cornenius)</li></ol></li></ol></li></ol><a href=#discussion-board><h5 id=discussion-board><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Discussion Board</h5></a><ol><li>For Rousseau what is most important/ should be prioritized in education?</li><li>What are the similarities of Comenius&rsquo; and Rousseau&rsquo;s views on education?</li></ol><p>What Rosseau saw as most important in education was preserving natural goodness and virtues, and forming a new society based on the realization of these qualities by all its members. This perspective was formed against modern life&rsquo;s conception of progress; unlike the modernists, who believed that recent advances in arts and sciences contributed to the purification of morals, he believed that civilization and progress corrupted the morality of human beings, who had once been good.</p><p>Despite how different their perspectives were (i.e. religious v.s. secular), both Comenius and Rosseau advocated for universal education. This was because they believed that it is a human birthright; the former believed in inherent human dignity (which comes from being created in God&rsquo;s image) while the latter believed in natural human rights. Aside from this, they also advocated for child-centered education. This is reflected in their intentions; both see schools as places for kids to just express themselves.
