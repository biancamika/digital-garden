With the many hollywood blockbusters and Netflix series that have been created about Kings, queens, knights, warlocks and the like, many visuals probably easily come to mind&mldr;but what was the backdrop of these fairytale-like adventures? The quick answer is: ==the feudal system.==</li><li>Watch this
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQq6OeiEfrg" rel=noopener>short video about feudalism</a> to recall the context of what we will begin to label as Chivalric Education. As you watch the video about the feudal system, think about these points:</li></ul><ol><li>What is the essence of the feudal system?</li><li>Does this social organization exist in current times?</li></ol><ul><li><p>In the Feudal System, chivalry brought forth an educational system particularly for the noble class - who, as you learned in the video above, was the lucky minority. &ndash; Chivalric education then, was training for knighthood. The
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_N8Nt5q5Go" rel=noopener>next video</a> shows shows the training a squire has to undergo to become a knight.</p></li><li><p>As compared to Monasticism and Scholasticism, Chivalric Education emphasized &ldquo;action&rdquo; (Remember in Greek Education - where the themes of man of wisdom and man of action first emerged?).</p></li><li><p>However, like in the past 2 types of education, the aim was still quite singular - ==a devotion to the service of the Knight&rsquo;s God - who in this case is his King and Queen.==</p></li><li><p>The aim therefore was mainly &ldquo;social discipline&rdquo; - in the two videos above, one of the clear descriptors of this age was how people were divided into classes in society - and for a person to live by the expectations of his/her class.</p></li></ul><blockquote><p>Who was the educated man in Chivalric Education?

The context of which was feudalism and the rule of royalty and the landed. However, in the latter part of the middle ages, the
<a href=https://www.history.com/topics/middle-ages/crusades rel=noopener>crusades</a> happened, and this set up the context for this next form of education.</li><li>Because of the crusades, there was an increase of trade and commerce across countries, which ushered the growth of free cities (the downfall of feudalism) and the rise of the middle class, or the ==&ldquo;burgher&rdquo;==</li><li>Anyway, it was in this context that the Craftsman in the Guild System was developed, in pursuit of the &ldquo;masterpiece&rdquo;.</li><li>Think about a masterpiece you&rsquo;ve made before. What did school or your own education have to do with it? How has your education contributed to your ability to create that masterpiece? or if you think that it wasn&rsquo;t education that led to it, what did?</li><li>In the guild system, creating a masterpiece is necessary to ==reach the highest level of education.== Guilds are associations of people who share a common interest or do the same kind of work (If being part of a varsity team or an organization led you to a masterpiece, then you might have been part of a &ldquo;modern day guild&rdquo;. The emergence of the guilds necessitated a new kind of education that focuses on ==vocational training.==</li><li>Watch this video on

In this module, you learned about the 4 key characters of Medieval Education (The monk, the scholastic, the knight and the craftsman) - each one representing a particular view about the educated person that consequently shaped the aims, methods and content of education. As we put this module to a close, we go back to the key question we started with: Who is an educated person?</p><ol><li>To what extent does your conception of the educated person agree with or differ from the 4 perspectives of the educated person in Medieval Education?</li><li>In these 4 types of education we explored, we saw how religion, society and economy influenced the type of education presented.

Aside from this, they must also be a lifelong learner, constantly dedicating themselves to gaining more expertise or enlightenment. Looking at the four key characters of Medieval Education, I can definitely say that there is more agreement than disagreement. This is because of the underlying aim of security, which I believe all the 4 types of education share despite their differences. The monk and the scholastic pursued education in order to secure their faith; the former wanted to shed the unholiness of their predecessors, while the latter wanted to defend their beliefs against unbelievers. Even if the next two types became more secular in nature, this need for security still remained. The knight and the craftsman pursued education in order to secure their place in society; the former did this by working to become a valuable asset for the king/queen, while the latter did this by working to be seen as valuable by their fellow citizens. Overall, this need for security made discipline (whether physical or intellectual) a result of Medieval Education. I believe this trait is stil worth developing today (without the extreme methods employed by Medieval Education).</p><p>Reflecting on my conception of the educated person, I can definitely see how much my social network has influenced my perspective. Before, I saw my education was mainly self-driven, given that I&rsquo;m an introvert with ADHD. Whenever I have a new hyperfixation (e.g. strength & conditioning, metacognition), I&rsquo;d go out of my way to learn all about it: diving down internet rabbitholes, attending relevant talks and classes, and writing my own notes and essays. However, I realize now that no human is exempt from being a social creature, which has definitely influenced my education; I can&rsquo;t deny that it&rsquo;s people who mainly drive and sustain my learning. Even if I&rsquo;m inherently passionate about my interests, it&rsquo;s my friends and idols that spark these passions inside of me. Even if I consider myself a philomath (a natural lover of learning), it&rsquo;s my peers and teachers that motivate me to continue learning. As a result, I now liken the educated person to a patchwork quilt; they are a &ldquo;masterpiece&rdquo; made up of their learning influences.</p><a href=#summary-of-module-2><h4 id=summary-of-module-2><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary of Module 2</h4></a><ol><li><strong>THE EDUCATED MAN:</strong> One of the main themes we explored in this module is the educated person, and as you saw, there were 4 different perspectives presented. As educators in the future, your own conception of the educated person will affect your views about teaching and learning. At the same time, the institutions you will be teaching in will also have their own perceptions of the educated person - it would be good to see if your paradigm matches with theirs.
<strong>2. RELIGION, SOCIETY and ECONOMY:</strong> Another set of themes that emerged here were the external influences of education - religion, society and economy. When you think about it, education today is still influenced by these forces. What other forces do you think continues to flavor the aims and type of education? Think about schools like Ateneo - what is the bias of institutions like ours?</li></ol></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li>No backlinks found</li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://garden.bianca.digital/js/graph.abd4bc2af3869a96524d7d23b76152c7.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by Bianca Aguilar using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, © 2023</p><ul><li><a href=https://garden.bianca.digital/>Home</a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/biancamikaila>Twitter</a></li><li><a href=https://are.na/bianca-aguilar>Are.na</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
