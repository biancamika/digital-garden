Closure delivers value by creating a reputation cost for deviation from shared colleague opinion and practice.</li></ul></li><li>CAUTION: <strong>The reputation mechanism by which closure delivers value can have a side-effect of groupthink, a passive &ldquo;waiting for orders&rdquo;, and so value destruction</strong>.<ul><li>When information moves unaffected through a network (e.g. eBay), closure creates wide bandwidth, facilitating trust and efficiency.</li><li>However, social networks usually involve an ==etiquette filter.== The more polite the people, the more etiquette affects what is shared, so ==closure produces echo, not bandwidth.==</li><li>The information that defines reputation is selected for empathy between gossipers, not accuracy about the person/object being discussed. The result is ==ignorant certainty== and you no longer own your reputation &ndash; your reputation is owned by the people who gossip about you.</li><li>Therefore, there are three key players in reputation development: you, your contact, and the contact&rsquo;s colleague.</li><li>Build by focusing on projects colleagues will want to discuss. Allowed to develop unchecked, the ignorant certainty fostered by closed-network echo can become rigid stereotypes about people and practices outside the group (with predictable problems for the realized value of diversity), and people withdraw into Milgram&rsquo;s agentic state, waiting for orders.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Overall, you need both <a class="internal-link broken">Brokerage</a> and <a class="internal-link broken">Closure</a><ul><li><img src="/images/Advantage and Pathology in the Enterprise Network.png" width=auto></li></ul></li></ul><a href=#reading><h4 id=reading><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Reading</h4></a><a href=#strength-of-weak-ties><h4 id=strength-of-weak-ties><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Strength of Weak Ties</h4></a><p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3bBajcR5fE" rel=noopener>Social Networks and Getting a Job: Mark Granovetter</a></strong></p><a href=#social-map><h4 id=social-map><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Social Map</h4></a><a href=#instructions><h5 id=instructions><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Instructions</h5></a><p>Now that you know the importance of social capital&ndash;that is, your social connections, networks, and your strong and weak ties&ndash;<strong>create a sociogram or social map.</strong> </p><ul><li>You can draw your social map of strong and weak ties (have at least 20 connections there).<ul><li>Take a photo of it, put it in a document.</li><li>In the same document, answer these questions in a paragraph form:<ul><li>Am I a broker or am I part of a closed network? </li><li>How many &ldquo;groups&rdquo; or &ldquo;clusters&rdquo; of people do I broker?</li><li>What have been the benefits of belonging to different clusters?

Being a polymath, my various interests have led me to broker multiple groups of people; this can be best seen in how I am part of both dance and tech communities. Belonging to different clusters makes me a T-shaped person: someone who is both a generalist and a specialist, making them highly valuable. For instance, the mindfulness I acquired as a dancer helps me create user-friendly designs, and the computational thinking I learned in computer science helps me in self-studying certain skills/moves; overall, my unique experience in both dance and tech gives me a deep understanding of human cognition. I also acknowledge that having a closed network allows me to grow my reputation. I have been able to witness this by being part of Ateneo&rsquo;s orgs for dance and human-centered design, both of which are known for being excellent in their respective crafts. Interacting constantly with both current members and alumni of these organizations provided me opportunities for my personal development (e.g. internships, freelance projects, gigs). Overall, I believe that achieving an optimal social network requires a keen eye for structural holes, whether it&rsquo;s between or within clusters. Knowing what is needed will help you not only create new connections, but also nurture your existing relationships.</p></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li>No backlinks found</li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://garden.bianca.digital/js/graph.abd4bc2af3869a96524d7d23b76152c7.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by Bianca Aguilar using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, © 2023</p><ul><li><a href=https://garden.bianca.digital/>Home</a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/biancamikaila>Twitter</a></li><li><a href=https://are.na/bianca-aguilar>Are.na</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
