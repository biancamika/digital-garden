We&rsquo;ll start by clarifying what it is NOT. Then, we&rsquo;ll break down what goes into a learning objective statement.
<strong>Here&rsquo;s a quick exercise</strong> <em>(try to answer the question below - just in your head). <strong>Let&rsquo;s say these are statements for early grades students</strong>**:**</em>

Gr5-7), # 1 and 2 seem so elementary and could be learning activities that lead to a more complex objective. This leads us to the first key idea about learning objectives: ==<strong>🔑 Learning objectives should describe a desired result, not just an activity.</strong>==</p><a href=#writing-effective-objectives><h5 id=writing-effective-objectives><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Writing Effective Objectives</h5></a><ul><li>Let&rsquo;s reverse engineer this statement: <strong>&ldquo;Students should be able to write an essay on a given topic without grammatical errors.&rdquo;</strong> What do you think makes this a good objective?</li><li>Key components:<ul><li>==<strong>Behavioral:</strong> ==observable and measurable; identifies the <strong>performance</strong> and the <strong>product</strong><ul><li>E.G. &ldquo;write an essay&rdquo;</li></ul></li><li>Identify the learning ==<strong>conditions</strong>==<ul><li>E.G. &ldquo;on a given topic&rdquo;</li></ul></li><li>Identify the ==<strong>criterion</strong>==<ul><li>Criterion: set of standards you want student to achieve</li><li>Standards can be of a particular discipline (e.g. writing), or time?</li><li>There are some times when learning objectives don&rsquo;t identify the criterion because what teachers do in these instances is talk about the criterion in terms of <strong>grading</strong></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><a href=#moores-classroom-teaching-skills><h5 id=moores-classroom-teaching-skills><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Moore&rsquo;s &ldquo;Classroom Teaching Skills&rdquo;</h5></a><p>Clarifying the difference between conditions and criterion

Objectives allow you to see learning.</strong>
<em>If the objective of teaching is for students to learn something, then ==it starts with articulating what you want to see.== Of course you do have long-term goals that you might not be able to realistically see in the time you have with your students - and though it is important to think of those, you&rsquo;ll have to articulate how you want to see those goals at this moment - these are what objectives are.</em></p><p><strong>2. Objectives allow you to set standards.</strong>
<em>Often, learning is about a change in your students&rsquo; knowledge, skills and attitude - what we know from research is that ==if this change just happens in the lower order stages, it is less likely to be retained and to be actually used in real life situations in the future.== This is why we consult Bloom. :)</em></p><a href=#ph-design><h2 id=ph-design><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>PH Design</h2></a><p>#design #culture #Filipino</p><ul><li>Pancit as culture&mldr;pancit as design</li><li>Design isn&rsquo;t just aesthetics&mldr; we have to think about its roots&mldr;</li><li>There are 100+ kinds of pancit!</li><li>We have the privilege to do research</li><li>Food also counts as information!

<a href=https://www.youtube.com/c/vsauce1 rel=noopener>vsauce</a></em> or <em>
<a href=https://www.youtube.com/c/RealLifeLore rel=noopener>reallifelore</a></em>. These videos, which I might call ‘factoid-core’, package interesting facts and concepts about the physical world into the same basic format as video game lore explainer videos. Factoid-core renders the world as a collection of extremely digestible, discrete bits of esoterica, creating a perpetual ‘mind=blown’ affective stance. One reason why factoid-core has remained so successful as ‘edutainment’ is that turning history, politics, science, and geography into ‘lore’ makes knowledge acquisition about the real world ‘interesting’ [1]—akin to learning the intricacies of a fictional world that one is deeply invested in. Calling information ‘lore’ is an attempt to make it worth deeply investing in.</p></blockquote><ul><li>^^^ wondering how this can be seen in politics&mldr;especially with the spread of disinformation&mldr;</li><li>look also into celebrities and lore-building&mldr;.and fandoms&mldr;</li><li>&ldquo;in a media landscape where all content has been flattened to the same level, what does it mean to turn someone’s real life into lore?&rdquo;</li></ul></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li>No backlinks found</li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://garden.bianca.digital/js/graph.abd4bc2af3869a96524d7d23b76152c7.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by Bianca Aguilar using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, © 2023</p><ul><li><a href=https://garden.bianca.digital/>Home</a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/biancamikaila>Twitter</a></li><li><a href=https://are.na/bianca-aguilar>Are.na</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
