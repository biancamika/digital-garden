And perhaps my flowers needed something else to grow. A different light. A different watering cycle. (let us also never forget that we are heliotropic beings,,, do not deny yourselves the necessary light for growth)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>==Comparison is the thief of joy.== And in trying to nurture your own mind, you can’t let the parasite of comparison in… you will eat your potential alive.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>I hated picking weeds in my Mom’s garden when I was growing up… I never understood how there wasn’t a better system. Tending to the garden can feel silly, repetitive, you can feel it in your muscles. Why am I coming back to this video, what did I miss, what else can I grab… sometimes ==it’s just about it soaking deeper and deeper into the soil.==</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>I can’t stress how important I believe inputs are. Your psychospace is the root of all action, feeling, expresso potential…</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>There’s something to releasing yourself in the form of media, and ==cycling that back into yourself so you don’t lose it.==</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>We are consumption and desire machines… in a world of abundance, there is a constant effort that must be put forth to ==break the mirage of schizophrenic choice.==</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>You can’t introduce every seed and nutrient and constant light and never turning the hose off… it will only produce muddied streams…</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Let flowers take the time to bloom, and when you want to shift the perfume that radiates from from the bed, ==the flowers you allowed to run their course will nurture the new seeds.==</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Be careful what you let into your garden,,, whom you let into your garden,,,</p><p>You are more impressionable than you think. You are part of a chain, but you can select what you’re linking to.</p></blockquote><p><img src=/images/DE00BA21-728D-4B32-BB08-3557E2008B76.jpeg width=auto></p><a href=#nfts-as-keys-1><h3 id=nfts-as-keys-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>NFTs as Keys (1)</h3></a><blockquote><p>The medium is the message&mldr;the medium isn’t the car, it’s the road. The car is just the current programming.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>==ETH itself is a social network.== And when you embrace it as such, more behaviors and innovation unlock well beyond DeFi.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>DeFi, was simply the most attainable model because ==it is the old medium within the new.== Strip what’s wrong with Wall St. and improve it with the tools of the new medium.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Similarly, the jpeg is about stripping certain qualities of the art market and how it isn’t suited for the internet -> and pulling it into the new medium.</p></blockquote><p><strong>What ETH provides us with (to understand the forming attributes of NFTs):</strong></p><ul><li>public histories -> provenance, ownership verification</li><li>virtual machine -> new style of digital objects (code)</li><li>smart contracts -> transactions, fractionalization, party bids</li></ul><p>These are basic first order effects of this qualities. Direct mapping from ownership structure -> DAO structuring. <strong>First example of NFTs as keys.</strong></p><blockquote><p>The first obvious key unlock, is the purchase ==unlocking the marketplace of that collection. ==</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>This was quickly followed up by remedying the sense of “where lambo sir” -> ==communities.== Verify you have this NFT in your wallet, unlock the Discord.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>the problem is that these unlocks are hardlyyyyy touching the chain. The medium itself…</p></blockquote><p><strong>Blitmap:</strong> taking a step beyond using generative art on-chain as the basis for new mints -> was creating a mechanism for the creation of the keys themselves.</p><ul><li>a group of artists created 100 original pixel art pieces</li><li>once those were minted you were able to pick a base + a palette, from the original pieces</li><li>in combining those you minted “a sibling”, a remix of a piece you owned and the original creators received a split of that mint</li><li>with a total collection of 1600 pieces, all community made on-chain</li></ul><blockquote><p>==Humans are obsessed with being part of the creation process.== It’s just how we are wired. It drives so many acts, as silly as looking through the window cutouts at construction sites to sex.
This on-chain mechanism for a community to craft their own keys is as simple and human as it gets.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>If you’re thinking about NFT’s right now (from a business perspective, if you’re vibing off of 1:1’s or gifting to friends much love to you), you have to be thinking about (no pun intended) ==the chain of interactions you believe the object is helping to unlock.==</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>John and I have jammed on a creation of an NFT game where your purchase of the NFT allows you to enter the world. Death in that world strips you of the NFT and forces a sale. Very inspired by Hunter x Hunter’s greed island.</p></blockquote><a href=#bookbear-express><h2 id=bookbear-express><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>bookbear express</h2></a><a href=#run-your-own-race><h3 id=run-your-own-race><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>run your own race</h3></a><blockquote><p>Run your own race, as in: ==you set certain standards for yourself, and you focus on meeting them.== When you meet them, you’re proud of yourself. When you don’t, you urge yourself to try harder. You don’t question your standards based on what anyone else is doing. You don’t look over at someone else’s race and think, I’m doing a bad job because you’re going faster. ==You just focus on your own pace.==</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>I have a friend whose communication style I really admire: she’s clear, emotionally honest, and sets great boundaries. My hope is to be like that in every important emotional encounter: ==to express my needs clearly, to be as honest as possible, and to make it clear what’s okay and what isn’t.== This is incredibly freeing, because it means ==I judge myself by my own standard of behavior in every relationship, and not by the other person’s response.==</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>I’ve noticed that most people seem to overly fixate on other people’s responses: i.e. my partner is upset at me, so I must have been a bad girlfriend. She didn’t want to go on another date, so I must have been super boring and said the wrong thing. I had a fight with my friend and they’ve been ignoring me since, so I must have overestimated our intimacy&mldr;if you want to calibrate accurately, you have to center your own behavior. How did you act? ==If you have no way to judge that’s not based on obsessively analyzing other people’s micro-reactions to you, you probably don’t know who you are in the absence of someone else’s verdict.==</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>==If you’re forever looking around for validation, you’ll never be able to make anything that’s completely your own. Because you don’t even know what you think.== You don’t know what is good and beautiful outside of what is culturally dictated to be good and beautiful. We believe that desire is mimetic, but we forget that the people who inspire real desire are always people who are redefining it—who give us something new to look at, allow us to escape groupthink. There’s nothing more powerful than separating signal from noise, spotting a phenomenon no one else has recognized yet. But to do that ==you need your own separate thoughts.==</p></blockquote><a href=#feelings-first><h3 id=feelings-first><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>feelings first</h3></a><blockquote><p>I was going to start this off by telling you an anecdote about my dad. Last weekend my uncle told me that he was struggling to switch from freshwater fishing to saltwater fishing, and wished my dad was still living in Vancouver so he could help out. &ldquo;Your dad,” he said, &ldquo;would research everything meticulously, come up with a bunch of theories on how to solve the problem, and then make us test out all his ideas one by one. He’s great at mapping things out.” I wanted to use this anecdote to explain where I get ==my need to intellectualize==—I’m just like my dad in that having all the information soothes me like nothing else. But then I realized I’m just doing the same thing I always do: trying to explain it all away. Developmental psychology, attachment theory, Jungian shadow work—anything to make it make sense. ==I’m happiest when I can present a theory, and say here, now I understand.==</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>But our feelings point to ==our values and our sensitivities, our pasts and our dreams.== My terror of gaining weight said something meaningful about my relationship with my body, my need to be conventionally attractive. My inability to confront anyone was the result of my deep-seated desire to please. ==Even when emotions don’t “make sense,” they have value.==</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>==The personal is political==: our perspectives on the world are first and foremost shaped by our emotional experiences. The sooner we accept that, the sooner we can abandon ego-based pursuits of objectivity and look for actual truth.</p></blockquote><a href=#yuan-wang><h2 id=yuan-wang><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Yuan Wang</h2></a><p>Why you should <strong>work in seasons</strong>: a nature-inspired approach towards personal growth and productivity</p><ol><li>Working in seasons enables us to achieve without burnout</li><li>Working in seasons puts focus on actions and commitments</li><li>Working in seasons forges deep connections with nature</li></ol><a href=#eliot-peper><h2 id=eliot-peper><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Eliot Peper</h2></a><p><strong>Book Reccomendations:</strong></p><ul><li><em>A Psalm for the Wild-Built</em> by Becy Chambers</li><li><em>Sum</em> by David Eagleman</li><li><em>Beginner&rsquo;s Mind</em> by Yo-Yo Ma</li><li><em>Neon Fever Dream</em> by Eliot Peper</li><li><em>This is How You Lose the Time War</em> by Amal El-Mohtar and Max Gladstone</li></ul><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Books are letters in bottles, cast into the waves of time, from one person trying to save the world to another.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>We think of reality as discrete: a world of concrete objects that interact. But reality is relational: a world of escalating interactions where events, not objects, are the basic building blocks. We only exist, grow, and change in relation to each other.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>I used to think that writing was a way to capture and share ideas, but the more I write, the more I realize that writing is a source of ideas.
