&ldquo;The Philippine Meme Archive: Documenting and Researching Filipino Internet Lore&rdquo;</p><p>This project aims to understand what digital collective memory looks like in the Philippines — how do Filipinos read, write, and remember the internet?</p><p>To answer this, it aims to accomplish the following objectives:</p><ul><li>To spotlight Filipino internet lore through the preservation and documentation of local memes</li><li>To investigate Filipino culture through the deconstruction of memes, identifying common elements and themes</li><li>To deepen Filipinos&rsquo; knowledge and appreciation for local internet lore through dissemination</li><li>To diversify the landscape of internet lore in order to challenge the idea of a
<a href=https://internetloreasia.hotglue.me/?About rel=noopener>single monolingual Internet as a homogenizing technology</a></li></ul><p>This applied research project will consist of the following components:</p><ul><li>A web archive collating all kinds of artifacts that can be considered as Filipino internet lore, such as memes, jargons, jokes, etc. Each artifact comes with its own page, where one can learn about its definition, history (i.e. origin and spread), and popular examples & usage. These artifacts can also be sorted and filtered through thanks to having tags like: type/format, date of release, and present characteristics (from concrete design elements/styles like maximalism to abstract thematic concepts). This archive will also come with a form that will allow anyone to contribute to it.</li><li>A glossary section that explains and expounds on the aforementioned characteristics. Each item here will also come with its own page, where one can learn about its defintion, history, related terms & theories, and example artifacts (which will come from the archive).</li><li>An editorial section consisting of a series of articles that aim to dissect how local memes reflect aspects of Filipino culture, from the values we&rsquo;ve grown up with to the current state of our politics. These articles will allow viewers to understand the significant role of digital folklore in our lives.</li><li>Facebook and Instagram accounts that will be used as the archive&rsquo;s promotional platforms. The posts in these accounts will cover the artifacts themselves, along with previews of glossary terms and editorial articles (broken down in photo carousels/albums or short video reels).</li></ul><p>Listed below is a list of sources that are similar to my vision for this project:</p><ul><li><a href=https://www.loc.gov/collections/web-cultures-web-archive/about-this-collection/ rel=noopener>Library of Congress&rsquo; Web Cultures Web Archive</a></li><li><a href=https://knowyourmeme.com/ rel=noopener>Know Your Meme</a></li><li><a href=https://tvtropes.org/ rel=noopener>TV Tropes</a></li><li><a href=https://peoplesgdarchive.org/ rel=noopener>The People&rsquo;s Graphic Design Archive</a></li></ul><p>Here is also a breakdown of the methods I&rsquo;ll be making use of to produce this project:</p><ul><li>Design and development of the web archive.</li><li>Collection and documentation of local memes.</li><li>Research and writing for the archive&rsquo;s glossary pages and editorial articles.</li><li>Design of promotional posts for the archive&rsquo;s social media platforms.</li></ul><p>This project will definitely involve human participants, since I&rsquo;m planning to:</p><ul><li>Analyze online posts + online communties</li><li>Conduct online surveys to determine how the general perception of Filipino memes</li><li>Interview subject matter experts (e.g. meme page admins, established artists & designers)</li><li>Conduct user testing of the archive to ensure a high-quality user experience</li></ul><p>Here are the disciplines framing my project, making use of classes I&rsquo;ve taken in both of my tracks:</p><ul><li>INFORMATION DESIGN - visual communication (semiotics), information architecture (UX/UI design), graphic design, Philippine design</li><li>COMPUTER SCIENCE - website + database development (front-end and back-end), cultural studies of contemporary technology</li></ul><p>Here are the frameworks that guide this project, based on the aforementioned disciplines:</p><ul><li>The artifacts that make up this archive must:<ul><li>be made in new media, which pertains to platforms that deploy and take advantage of digital communications. Distinguishing features of new media include non-hierarchial organiation and an active (prosumer) audience. Social media is one example.</li><li>be considered as

In online learning, it&rsquo;s not easy to just &ldquo;wing it&rdquo; (you know, those teachers who can just get by with their often entertaining personality and presence).</li><li>In online learning, &ldquo;learning&rdquo; - rightly so, is put to forefront.</li></ul></li><li>Therefore, teachers, the polymorphous bunch that we are, need to evolve, not just to be performers and facilitators in front of students, but to be ==designers and guides== as well - both requiring one crucial activity: planning.</li><li>We will reflect broadly about how teachers plan - and we will zoom into the paradigm we will use for this course called backward design.</li></ul><a href=#planning-forward><h4 id=planning-forward><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Planning forward</h4></a><a href=#activity><h5 id=activity><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Activity</h5></a><p>A. <strong>Imagine that you are planning to teach</strong> any of the following to a grade school student. </p><p>⌛ <strong>In 3 minutes</strong> (ideally setup a timer and don’t go beyond 3 minutes), “plan” to teach about this (no need to do any research on how to do it-just go ahead and do what you think would be right). Jot down notes or questions in a sheet of paper or in a digital notebook.</p><p><strong>Ready?</strong> Start when you are, then continue to read on to reflect on your experience.</p><p><strong>B. Look at your plan with notes and questions.</strong> Take note of the following (you can mark them with 1, 2, and 3)</p><p>1.) Notes/questions about <strong>what to teach about this</strong> (topics, facts, etc)</p><p>2.) Notes/questions about <strong>how to teach this</strong> (activities, strategies, etc)</p><p>3.) Notes/questions about <strong>why teach this</strong> (Application of this topic in real life, when will students use this, etc.)</p><p>Do you have more of 1, 2 or 3?</p><a href=#reflection><h5 id=reflection><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Reflection</h5></a><ul><li>When we plan to teach, there is often a tendency to focus on # 1 and/or #2.</li><li>Teachers, who are often experts in a certain discipline, would often jump into planning the content (what) and those who have trained to be teachers, the strategies (how).</li><li>This results to a &ldquo;teaching model&rdquo; that is commonly known as ==&ldquo;teach, then test&rdquo;== - teach the content, then come up with a test to check if students have learned it.</li></ul><blockquote><p>Is this an ideal way of planning? Why? or why not? (After all, the considerations of # 1(topics) and #2(activities/strategies) really make up most of what we do as teachers, aren&rsquo;t they?) What do you think? What do you think is the advantage and/or disadvantage of this way of planning?</p></blockquote><a href=#planning-backwards><h4 id=planning-backwards><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Planning backwards</h4></a><p><strong>Moving beyond teach, then test.</strong></p><ul><li>If you didn&rsquo;t see anything wrong with the planning to &ldquo;teach, then test&rdquo; model then you are not alone. This is still a prevalent planning model in the profession. </li><li>However, doing so sometimes leaves effective learning to chance because this type of planning ==leaves out a key player in the teaching process-the learner! ==</li><li>There is much wisdom in Hirst’s assertion that <strong>it is the learner that does the learning</strong> after all!  This means that if we want to effectively teach, we have to first begin with the learner-or in other words, to ask questions about # 3.</li><li>Why should learners learn “this”? Think about it. Technically, you can plan out topics and activities (most specially if you just plan to present the content) without considering the learners at all! </li><li>But, why can this be a challenge? ==If in the first place, why learners need to learn what you want them to learn is unclear, they will not naturally want to learn. ==</li><li>One way to understand this is to look back at our &ldquo;informal&rdquo; learning experiences (things we learned outside school) - remember some of the first few things you learned as a human being - how to walk, how to talk, etc. There was no curriculum that asked you to learn it - you learned these things because of something you yourself wanted to do (to walk, to talk and communicate with others, etc).</li></ul><p>This leads us to consider an alternative way of planning called <strong>backward design.</strong> So, what is backward design?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xzi2cm9WTg" rel=noopener>Here&rsquo;s a short video to introduce you to the concept</a>.</p><p><img src="/images/Pasted image 20220915233553.png" width=auto></p><ul><li>“Backward Design” (See Figure 1.1), first introduced by Ralph Tyler in 1948 and popularly adapted by Wiggins and McTighe (proponents of the Understanding by Design Framework), reverses how you typically plan for your teaching. In more &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; teaching, planning begins with # 3 (teach-learning experiences and instruction), then # 2 (test-find evidence of learning).</li><li>While in backward design, you begin with the desired results and acceptable evidence first, BEFORE planning activities and strategies to be part of instruction. In the anecdote above, it is beginning by &ldquo;planning the destination&rdquo;. Put in another way, this means that in this model, we begin with &ldquo;Why learners need to learn this?&rdquo; (desired results) first. This is very much aligned with Hirst&rsquo;s definition of teaching, where the objective of any teaching is for learners to learn &ldquo;x&rdquo; - if we clearly determine what &ldquo;x&rdquo; is, then whatever &ldquo;teaching&rdquo; we end up doing will be designed to gravitate towards it.</li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbKx_tG99ho" rel=noopener>Get a deeper overview of the process through this video</a></li><li><a href=https://files.ascd.org/staticfiles/ascd/pdf/siteASCD/publications/UbD_WhitePaper0312.pdf rel=noopener>Read more about backwards design in this whitepaper</a></li></ul><blockquote><ol><li>How do you think will planning backwards affect teaching and learning? Think about the subject area that you want to teach in the future - of you were to plan backwards, what do you think does this entail? What will be easy to do? What do you think will be challenging?</li><li>Recall your experiences as a learner - can you give an example where if the teacher planned backwards, it could have potentially made your experience as a learner better?</li></ol></blockquote><p>Backwards planning makes teaching and learning more intentional, which in turn increases effectiveness. This is because it considers the learner&rsquo;s needs in the design of their educational experience, which makes them more inclined to engaging in it.</p><p>I want to teach a movement practice in the future, whether it be a dance style or basic fitness. Planning backwards would entail for me the following: determining what successful learning outcomes look like (could be concrete, such as memorizing cetain vocabulary moves, or more abstract, like learning the value of discipline) and adapting my teachings to my students&rsquo; needs (e.g. background experience, learning disabilities). The former would be easy for me thanks to years of experience (which allows me to be certain about what needs to be learned), while the latter would be difficult for me because it would require a lot of effort to get to know my students (since each one is unique).</p><p>Reflecting on my experiences as learner makes me think of my old dance studio, where I was a part of the elite team. The artistic director introduced a cross-training class into our training program, and I was really excited to try this. However, after a few sessions, I ended up feeling really disappointed; class sessions were only a hour long (while dance classes usually last from 90 minutes to 2 hours), and whenever I was following the exercises, I felt like I was just going through the motions, not knowing how they&rsquo;d help me as a dancer. The class didn&rsquo;t feel effective to me at all, and it didn&rsquo;t seem worth the extra cost.</p><p>I would&rsquo;ve had a better learning experience if the teacher planned backwards. She could&rsquo;ve done this by determining the students&rsquo; goals and needs (because each dancer has a unique body and mind), creating our exercise program based on these, then making the objectives of this program explicit to us. For instance, she could&rsquo;ve introduced back strengthening exercises as a way to increase the height of our <em>arabesques</em>; along with this, she also could&rsquo;ve provided regressions and progressions of this exercise, so that students can adapt based on their back flexibility.</p><a href=#key-ideas-about-backward-design><h4 id=key-ideas-about-backward-design><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Key ideas about backward design</h4></a><p><strong>1.

<em>Planning is an essential part of the teaching process. Think of it as the &ldquo;behind the scenes&rdquo; of teaching, or the rolling credits at the end of watching a great movie.
