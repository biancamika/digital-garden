<a href=https://joi.ito.com/weblog/2012/04/30/a-week-of-a-stu.html rel=noopener>interesting article Links to an external site.</a>by Dr. Ito of MIT. He runs an experiment to monitor the level of &ldquo;thinking&rdquo; happening for one student for 7 days. Spend some time reviewing the graph below. Without delving too much into the science of the experiment, just interpret the graphs to mean that more peaks mean more thinking/more brain activity is happening.

note: it is unclear what is being done in class (we assume here that it is probably a straight lecture). This is not to say that lectures are bad and ineffective - they can, in fact, be quite effective!
However, if most of the time it&rsquo;s just the teacher talking in front, there is less of a chance to actually &ldquo;see&rdquo; learning happen. This is what we try to address by asking more questions. 
In this 2nd part of the module, we will build on this idea of making learning more visible to both learners and teachers. We&rsquo;ll do so by reviewing some strategies produced from the research conducted by Harvard Project Zero.</p></blockquote><a href=#visible-thinking-routines><h4 id=visible-thinking-routines><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Visible Thinking Routines</h4></a><ul><li>Overview of thinking routines:

Share your answer and why you think that is the most appropriate strategy to use.</p></li><li><p>Since it&rsquo;s the last activity of the module, please also share about your experience as a learner in Module 4. How did you find Module 4? What helped you learn? What hindered learning? (It&rsquo;s okay you can be honest. Your feedback will help me make necessary adjustments in the coming modules, if necessary). </p></li><li><p>The estimated learning time for the whole module is about 3 hours (about 1.5 hours per sub module). Did it take you that long? More or less? What were factors that contributed to the length of time?</p></li></ol><p><strong>Visible Thinking Strategy:</strong> Color, Symbol, Image is a routine for distilling the essence of ideas non-verbally. Out of all the other strategies under the &ldquo;Synthesizing & Organizing Ideas&rdquo; category, I chose this because I&rsquo;m a visual learner; as a designer and artist, I find skills such as visual association to be intuitive for me. Thus, this strategy seemed like the easiest to utilize.</p><p>What I visually associate with the EDUC 130 course:</p><ul><li><strong>Color:</strong> Blue. Aside from blue being the color of our Canvas interface, I chose blue because it is great at promoting high levels of thought. For instance: blue paper, blue ink, or blue highlighting can be used to help improve reading comprehension. Blue&rsquo;s utility is especially seen in learning situations that are challenging. For example: people with occupations that require a high cognitive load, such as programmers and academics, are more productive in a blue environment. Just like the color blue, the methods I&rsquo;ve learned for designing and facilitating learning are all ways to help our students with processing knowledge (e.g. scaffolding, questioning techniques, thinking routines).</li><li><strong>Symbol:</strong> A ticket. I associated this with Entrance and Exit Ticket activites teachers would often utilize in their classrooms, wherein a short prompt would be used to make students either recall relevant background knowledge or reflect on their learnings. This activity shows the important role of student feedback in guiding teaching decisions. Without feedback, teachers won&rsquo;t be able to help students connect to the lesson (Activate from Context → Connect to Content) or gauge their understanding of it (Evaluate to Validate).</li><li><strong>Image:</strong> Brain waves in the classroom. I thought of this image after being inspired by Dr. Ito&rsquo;s brain activity monitoring experiment. I chose this because I think all teachers should aim for high brain-to-brain synchrony. We can only say that our lessons are effective and engaging if we ensure that no learner gets left behind. Teachers who are mindful of student and teacher factors will be able to equitably engage with their learners.</li></ul><p><strong>Sources:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=https://www.shiftelearning.com/blog/how-do-colors-influence-learning rel=noopener>https://www.shiftelearning.com/blog/how-do-colors-influence-learning</a></li><li><a href=https://www.brown.edu/sheridan/teaching-learning-resources/teaching-resources/course-design/classroom-assessment/entrance-and-exit rel=noopener>https://www.brown.edu/sheridan/teaching-learning-resources/teaching-resources/course-design/classroom-assessment/entrance-and-exit</a></li><li><a href=https://kids.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frym.2020.00096 rel=noopener>https://kids.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frym.2020.00096</a></li></ul><p><strong>My experience as a learner in Module 4:</strong></p><ul><li>It was interesting being exposed to all the different kinds of different routines! However, I preferred the previous modules because of how they contained much more written and visual information, which made it easier for me to take notes (compared to external sources like videos and websites). I did like how Project Zero&rsquo;s Thinking Routine toolbox contained easily digetsible PDFs for each routine!</li><li>I do think that I spent the expected amount of time on this module.

Pre-Hispanic Philippine art and expression were minuscule: it focused on meaning and tradition, not the grandiose. On the other hand, post-colonial art and expression are influenced by our colonizers&rsquo; form of art and expression, which were grand in size and focused more on forms, not the embedded meaning.== This expression of culture is exquisite yet minuscule, may it be textile, jewelry, woodwork, sculptures, and other crafts - even in weaponry and armor. As seen in the screenshot below, this shield had various inscriptions all over, which were a mix of religious texts of the Moro people.
Other parts of the presentation that piqued my interest were her discussion of a number of terms that were to be junked and ones that should be used with care. Some of the terms to be junked that she mentioned caught my attention - specifically Malay (which she explained was a language and not a race) and race (which is not a legit category). I always thought that the Philippines came from the &ldquo;Malay&rdquo; people given the many commonalities we have in terms of culture and physique. She debunked such, explaining that the Filipinos are part of the Austronesian-speaking people that originated from Taiwan (not Chinese nor Han) and spread Southwards to Indonesia, Malaysia, and Polynesian areas. She added that the languages of the islands in the Polynesian areas actually originated from the Philippines, citing that some people from Luzon sailed out into the Pacific Ocean, ending up on a then-uninhabited island - Guam. In relation to such, Ms. Marian also clarified some terms to use with care such as dialect. I always had confusion with these two terms, but she clarified such, saying that Cebuano and Tagalog are not dialects, but languages. Some examples of dialects are the Batangas-Tagalog and Mindoro-Tagalog dialects.
Lastly, her closing also piqued my interest. She explained that all that she has shared in her presentation, although may sound opinionated (specifically the portion of &ldquo;Words to Junk&rdquo;), are based on scientific evidence and scholarly research. The information she shared has been agreed upon by many archaeologists globally, yet is not known to the locals who are the topic of the research. She says that the problem lies in ==how this information is not circulated in mainstream media.== Furthermore, she suggests solving this problem ==not only by publishing this information to make it accessible physically but by also translating this knowledge from scientific to easily digestible terms.== She ends by saying that &ldquo;the task of knowing the updated, evidence-based syntheses about the Filipinos more than a nationalistic endeavor. It concerns social justice.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><a href=#discussion-board><h4 id=discussion-board><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Discussion Board</h4></a><p><strong>Share a screenshot of one scene or moment from the webinar.

I will be using the ones made by
<a href=https://makomicropress.com/ rel=noopener>Makó Micro-Press</a> as an example.</p><ul><li><strong>Ethnoscapes</strong><ul><li>When they settled in the Philippines, our colonizers (i.e. the Spanish, Americans, Japanse) brought with them colonial values, ideas, mindsets, etc. One of the ways they disseminated this was through presses.</li><li>One of the earliest underground publications, La Solidaridad, was created by a group of ilustrados. Many of them were educated in Spain, which exposed them to European liberal and nationalist ideals.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Technoscapes</strong><ul><li>The rise of alternative press publications such as zines wouldn&rsquo;t have been possible without the large-scale production and distribution of the printing press.</li><li>Photocopying machines also played a big role in their circulation, as seen in Xerox Journalism: the underground or illegal publishing that occurred during Martial Law.</li><li>The advent of the Internet kickstarted digital self-publishing. Creators can distribute their zines by uploading them as PDF copies to personal storage platforms or online repositories, such as Google Drive and the Anarchist Library. Blogs and social media websites like Instagram are also hopeful for promotion; these platforms can be seen as the &ldquo;modern&rdquo; equivalent of zines due to their shared self-published nature.</li><li>Despite the 21st century&rsquo;s primary focus on everything digital, the print format of the zine remains relevant. By sticking to print, zines rebel against the cultural dominance of internet platforms. The format also gives creators “safety in-print” by helping them avoid strict copyright and community standard restrictions, along with malicious attention (e.g. redtagging).</li></ul></li><li><strong>Financescapes</strong><ul><li>The introduction of electronic money through mobile wallets like GCash and Maya have definitely made it easier to sell zines to a wider audience. Now, self-publishers are no longer restricted by physical confinements and print runs that only reach those who attend events.</li><li>Financescapes can also be seen in the growing popularity of zines. It could be said that their rise stems partly from an economic shift, particularly in the creative sector. Zine veteran Paolo Jose Cruz notes how in recent times there had been a <em>“general clamor for more tangible analog and print media”</em> as well as a commercial landscape that leans towards <em>“more niche or specialty arts and craft hobbies.”</em> And with this focus on creative work, sprung more avenues; examples of these avenues are fine arts classes and workshops about <em>“monetizing art creation”</em> and the emergence of mixed spaces where zines can find a substantial consumer base.</li><li>These mixed spaces are local fairs, expos, and conventions. Through a steady combination of marketing and select exhibitors, zine creators were pushed into broader public consciousness and propelled the scene towards popularity. By shunning traditional notions of marketing, self-publishers, zine fair organisers and editors are generating validity around underrepresented artists and makers.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Mediascapes</strong><ul><li> The bourgeois take control of the media industry. One example is Martial Law censorship, wherein the industry was monopolized by Marcos&rsquo; regime. Newspapers, radio and TV networks run by Marcos cronies served as mouthpieces of the dictatorship. The Marcos regime also established the Kapisanan ng mga Brodkaster ng Pilipinas (KBP or Association of Broadcasters of the Philippines) as a way of controlling the broadcast industry under the doctrine of self-censorship. Now, we can still see this censorhsip today, given our current government (e.g. ABS-CBN shutdown).</li><li>In contrast to this: Self-publishing is heavily rooted in the Punk subculture, wherein musical freedom was connected with the human ability to reason and ask questions. In line with this, it was a disc jockey (Dante “Howling Dave” David) who introduced fanzines to Metro Manila on his show at dzRJ 810 “Rock of Manila”. Consequently, many early local fanzines were centered around alternative music.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Ideoscapes</strong><ul><li>Writer and self-publisher Adam David states that zines must serve as manifestos, not propagandas. The latter involves messaging wherein the reader is coereced into believing false truths, while the former is a manifestation of one&rsquo;s inner truth, or that of the movement they choose to belong to. Manifestos, being proactive, encourage the reader to join a cause or adopt a mindset.</li><li>Through zines and other DIY (Do-It-Yourself) artwork, Makó Micro-Press aims to create and sustain counter-hegemonic cultures. Critiquing existing systems of oppression (e.g. capitalism, fascism), they advocate for alternative radical movements such as socialism and abolitionism.</li><li>Utilizing the Filipino language in their zines helps Makó helps disseminate these ideologies. This kind of translation is vital in a nation that is heavily misinformed about these movements, as seen in the pervasiveness of redtagging.</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Sources:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=https://aramslasharam.wordpress.com/2018/02/10/19/ rel=noopener>https://aramslasharam.wordpress.com/2018/02/10/19/</a></li><li><a href=https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED311426.pdf rel=noopener>https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED311426.pdf</a></li><li><a href=https://www.cnnphilippines.com/life/culture/literature/2017/08/30/zine-making-adam-david.html rel=noopener>https://www.cnnphilippines.com/life/culture/literature/2017/08/30/zine-making-adam-david.html</a></li><li><a href=https://purveyr.com/2018/09/10/zine-culture-in-the-philippines/ rel=noopener>https://purveyr.com/2018/09/10/zine-culture-in-the-philippines/</a></li><li><a href=https://www.dazeddigital.com/artsandculture/article/25561/1/how-the-internet-revived-the-zine-scene rel=noopener>https://www.dazeddigital.com/artsandculture/article/25561/1/how-the-internet-revived-the-zine-scene</a></li></ul><a href=#pamumuna-pagtutol-pagka-filipino-pagkabansa><h3 id=pamumuna-pagtutol-pagka-filipino-pagkabansa><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Pamumuna, pagtutol, pagka-Filipino, pagkabansa</h3></a><p>Each of the abovementioned living cultures manifests itself in design.

These would often advocate human rights and critque social issues such as neoliberalism and neocolonialism. I&rsquo;d see these stickers often at local conventions and stores like Common Room.

Unfortunately, his campaign achieved its desired, as seen with his 31 million voters.
