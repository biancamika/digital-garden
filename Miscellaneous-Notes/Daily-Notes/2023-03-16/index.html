<a href=https://youtu.be/geVah0hecPQ rel=noopener>Magisterial Lectures | Roberto Conrado Guevara PhD - On Journeys & Crossroads: Reflections on Exodus</a></h5><blockquote><p>We end the different modules with the coming together of the personal and communal.
In this video, Bobby Guevara talks about the concept of slavery and freedom from a personal stance. Think about how slavery and freedom applies to you and your personal development.</p></blockquote><p>#religion #spirituality</p><ul><li><strong>The Reality of Slavery</strong><ul><li>The phenomenal growth of the children of Israel leads to the people&rsquo;s enslavement: &ldquo;&mldr;they set taskmasters over them to oppress with forced labor&mldr; The Egyptians became ruthless in imposing tasks on the Isarelites, and made their lives bitter with hard service&rdquo; (Ex. 1:11, 13-14)</li><li>Insight #1: <strong>You might not like slavery, but after a while, you get used to it.</strong><ul><li>E.G. Spanish colonization, Martial Law</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>The Story of Exodus and the Reality of Unfreedom</strong><ul><li>&ldquo;&mldr;[W]e have constructed patterns in our lives&ndash;patterns in relationships, patterns at work, and so often, self-defeating patterns, which undermine our best interests&mldr;There is always a &rsquo;logical&rsquo; connection between a surface symptom or pattern and a historic wounding to the soul.&rdquo; - <em>James Hollis, Finding Meaning in the Second Half of Life, 2005</em></li><li><strong><a class="internal-link broken">Ignatian Spirituality</a> and the Reality of Unfreedom</strong><ul><li>We can see these self-defeating patterns&mldr;this form of slavery&mldr;as a invitation to greater awareness</li><li>&ldquo;With much &lsquo;unfreedom&rsquo; in us we will never be able to do serious discernment and we will just continue to be at the mercy of our attachments.&rdquo; <em>- Ramon Maria Luza Bautista, S.J., Schooled by the Spirit, 2009</em></li></ul></li><li>&ldquo;Where is your brother?&rdquo; (Gen 4:9). Where is your brother or sister who is enslaved? Where is the brother and sister whom you are killing each day in clandestine warehouses, in rings of prostitution, in children used for begging, in exploiting undocumented labour? Let us not look the other way&mldr;The issue involves everyone!" <em>- Pope Francis, Evangelii Gaudium #211</em><ul><li>Pope Francis wishes for all of us to hear God&rsquo;s cry.</li><li>He tells us not to look the other way, because these issues involve everyone.</li><li>Reflect on the question of slavery that is amidst us: Who are our brothers and sisters? The ones whose lives have been made bitter by oppression?</li><li>The invitation for greater awareness is not again meant to bring us to a dark place, but really an invitation for deeper compassion and for deeper solidarity</li></ul></li><li><strong>The Cry</strong><ul><li>&ldquo;The Isarelites groaned under their slavery, and cried out&mldr;. [T]heir cry for help rose up to God. God heard their groaning&mldr; remembered his covenant&mldr;and took notice of them&rdquo; (Ex. 2:23-25)</li><li>The crying out is important because without the crying out, you just end up returning to Egypt. You just end up returning to slavery. The crying out, it&rsquo;s not just an expression of misery you knowthe crying out is also a complaint it&rsquo;salso a protestit&rsquo;s also an acknowledgement that thingsare not rightthe crying out is the first sign ofopenness to the hopeful expectationthat slavery is not the last wordi</li><li>E.G. Student praying to God in a retreat about her anger and resentment towards her parents. By acknowledging these (and thus lifting these up to God), she felt that she had the opportunity to start anew.</li><li>That&rsquo;s what tears are all about. They are an acknowledgement that one needs to be saved.</li><li>Insight #2: <strong>The basic requirement of freedom is the awareness of &ldquo;exile&rdquo;, the groan of conscious alienation.</strong> <em>- Avivag Gottlieb Zornberg</em> <a class="internal-link broken">Freedom requires awareness of exile</a><ul><li>Before one can be free, one must be aware that one is not free. That awareness is manifested in the crying out.</li><li><a class="internal-link broken">Freedom is being conscious of your constraints</a></li><li><a class="internal-link broken">The alternative to freedom is unconsciousness</a></li></ul></li><li><strong>Ignatian Spirituality and Self-Awareness</strong><ul><li>Saint <a class="internal-link broken">Ignatius of Loyola</a> says that one of the temptations of the evil spirit is to tell us to keep your weakness in the dark. Just keep it hidden, don&rsquo;t let it be known. But we know the change begins when we are able to bring our weakness into the light.</li><li>&ldquo;As <a class="internal-link broken">Ignatius of Loyola</a> observes, the enemy of human nature does fear discovery. While our weaknesses remain unacknowledged or closeted away, we are powerless over them. The sometimes painful process of dragging our weaknesses into full light of day by understanding them is the first empowering stride toward conquering them.&rdquo; <em>- Chris Lowney, Heroic Leadership, 2003</em></li><li>Related to insights from #DLQ10<ul><li><a class="internal-link broken">The wound is the place where the Light enters you</a></li><li><a class="internal-link broken">Brokenness</a></li></ul></li></ul></li><li>&ldquo;When the heart is able to ask itself and weep, then we can understand something&mldr; Dear young boys and girls, today&rsquo;s world doesn&rsquo;t know how to cry&mldr;<a class="internal-link broken">Certain realities of life we only see through eyes cleansed by our tears</a>. I invite each one here to ask yourself: ==have I learned how to weep?== Have I learned how to weep for the marginated or for a street child who has a drug problem or for an abused child?&rdquo; <em>- Pope Francis, Message to Filipino Youth at UST, 18 Janurary 2015</em></li><li>The cry is pivotal in opening the gates that make freedom and liberation possible.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>The Call of Moses</strong><ul><li>&ldquo;The cry of the Isarelites has now come to me; I have also seen how the Egyptians oppress them. So come, I will send you to Pharaoh to bring my people, the Isarelites, out of Egypt.&rdquo; (Ex. 3:9-10)</li><li>Certain formula in the Bible: people are called by God, and they object to this.</li><li>Moses objects to God 5 times. Roberto finds Moses&rsquo; call fascinating because it&rsquo;s as if the Lord throughout that entire process was shaping his heart, shaping his heart to make it more docile to the promptings of the Lord&rsquo;s spirit.</li><li>Insight #3: <strong><a class="internal-link broken">God calls each of us to the vocation of freedom</a>.</strong></li></ul></li><li><strong>The Summons to Vocation</strong><ul><li>&ldquo;God calls you to make definitive choices, and He has a plan each of you: to discover that plan and to respond to your vocation is to move toward personal fulfillment.&rdquo; <em>- Pope Francis, World Youth Day 2013</em></li><li>When we ask questions such as &ldquo;What is the meaning of my life?&rdquo;, &ldquo;Why was I created?&rdquo;, &ldquo;Why am I here?&rdquo;, &ldquo;This one life I have&mldr;what am I being invited to gamble it on?&rdquo;&mldr;we enter the realm of vocation. ==Where are we being someone to?==</li><li>&ldquo;The Christian vocation, rooted in the contemplation of the Father&rsquo;s heart, &mldr; inspires us to solidarity in bringing liberation to our brothers and sisters, especially the poorest.&rdquo; <em>- Pope Francis, World Day of Prayer for Vocations, 26 April 2015</em><ul><li>Vocation is not just personal.</li><li>This reminds us that the question is not just at this point in my life &ldquo;Am I more free?&rdquo; An equally important question is: &ldquo;Are others, especially the poorest among us, more free because of me?&rdquo;</li></ul></li><li>&ldquo;God calls you to the place where your deep gladness and the world&rsquo;s deep hunger meet.&rdquo; <em>- Frederick Bucchner</em><ul><li>Reminds us that vocation is not just my deepest gladness and my deepest joys (See <a class="internal-link broken">Ignatian Spirituality</a> and <a class="internal-link broken">Desire</a>), but rather ==the intersection of my deepest desires and the world&rsquo;s deepest hungers.==</li></ul></li><li>&ldquo;The meaning of your life is to find your gift. The purpose of your life is to give it away.&rdquo; <em>- Pablo Picasso</em></li></ul></li><li><strong>For Reflection and Prayer</strong><ul><li>How would you describe your inner journey these past years. Take time to recall the most significant lights and shadows of your journey.</li><li>Reflecting upon your life and deepest desires, what do you think you are being called to doz.</li><li>What would you consider the &lsquo;Egypt&rsquo; that enslaves you? How do these affect you, your relationships, work, and life?</li></ul></li></ul><h5 id=magisterial-lectures--roberto-conrado-guevara-phd---on-journeys--crossroads-story-of-our-liveshttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvk0-p7sky1tsfeatureyoutube><a rel=noopener class="internal-link broken" data-src=#ZgotmplZ>Magisterial Lectures | Roberto Conrado Guevara Phd - On Journeys & Crossroads: Story of Our Lives</a></h5><ul><li><strong>Crossing the Sea: From Slavery to Freedom, Death to Life</strong><ul><li>&ldquo;What have you done to us, bringing us out of Egypt! Is rhis not the very thing we told you in Egypt, &lsquo;Let us alone and let us serve the Egyptians?&rsquo; For it would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the wilderness.&rdquo; <em>- Exodus 14:1-14</em><ul><li>Why did the Isarelies miss Egypt? Perhaps because of fear.</li></ul></li><li>Insight #4: <strong><a class="internal-link broken">What makes change difficult is fear</a>. If you want to live in mediocrity, then live in fear.</strong> <em>- Fr. Venacio Calpotura SJ</em><ul><li><a class="internal-link broken">Mediocrity stems from fear</a></li></ul></li><li>&ldquo;Fear governs so much of our lives&mldr;Standing up to our fear is perhaps the most critical decision necessary in the governsnce of our life&mldr;&rdquo; <em>- James Hollis, Finding Meaning in the Second Half of Life, 2005</em></li><li>James Hollis states that one of the most common ways fear can be in charge will be found in ==our flight from personal responsibility.==<ul><li>What does one do when one is afraid? Blaming and scapegoating.</li><li>This is exactly what the Isarelites did with Moses.</li><li>When one is afraid, one lets go of responsibility.</li><li>But we can choose to stand up to our fears instead.</li></ul></li><li>&ldquo;There is a temptation that says it is &lsquo;better to stay here,&rsquo; where I&rsquo;m safe. But this is the slavery of Egypt: &lsquo;I fear moving forward, I&rsquo;m afraid of where the Lord will bring me.&rsquo; Fear, however, &lsquo;is not a good counselor.&rsquo;&rdquo; <em>- Pope Francis, Courage in Spite of Our Weakness, 2 July 2013</em></li><li>Hollis also says that the other by-product of fear is lethargy: the lack of energy, the lack of enthusiasm, the lack of the will to move forward, to dream, to imagine.<ul><li>We are tempted to give in, to be immobilized by fear.</li></ul></li><li>Moses&rsquo; response: &ldquo;Fear not, stand firm, and <em>see</em> the salvation of the Lord, which he will work for you today; for the Egyptians whom you <em>see</em> today, you shall never <em>see</em> again. The Lord will fight for you, and you have only to be still.&rdquo;<ul><li>Moses uses the word see 3 times. This was probably deliberate because you have to remember that what caused Israel&rsquo;s fear was what they looked at. What caused their fear was what they saw. Moses is telling them to not look at the sources of your fearr. Change what you&rsquo;re looking at. Rather than look at your fear, look at what the Lord will do for you today.</li></ul></li><li>Insight #5: <strong>To lead involves helping one&rsquo;s self and others &lsquo;see&rsquo; things in a new light.</strong> <a class="internal-link broken">Leadership involves helping yourself and others see things in a new light</a><ul><li>Moses was a leader to the Isarelites because he taught them to see themselves and reality in a new way.</li></ul></li><li>&ldquo;May your choices reflect your hopes, not your fears.&rdquo; <em>- Nelson Mandela</em><ul><li>Same act of looking, but you decide what you look at</li></ul></li><li>Prevalent method of leadership: making people fixate on their fears. Is this necessary?
