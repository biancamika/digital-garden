<a href=https://youtu.be/geVah0hecPQ rel=noopener>Magisterial Lectures | Roberto Conrado Guevara PhD - On Journeys & Crossroads: Reflections on Exodus</a></h5><blockquote><p>We end the different modules with the coming together of the personal and communal.
In this video, Bobby Guevara talks about the concept of slavery and freedom from a personal stance. Think about how slavery and freedom applies to you and your personal development.</p></blockquote><p>#religion #spirituality</p><ul><li><strong>The Reality of Slavery</strong><ul><li>The phenomenal growth of the children of Israel leads to the people&rsquo;s enslavement: &ldquo;&mldr;they set taskmasters over them to oppress with forced labor&mldr; The Egyptians became ruthless in imposing tasks on the Isarelites, and made their lives bitter with hard service&rdquo; (Ex. 1:11, 13-14)</li><li>Insight #1: <strong>You might not like slavery, but after a while, you get used to it.</strong><ul><li>E.G. Spanish colonization, Martial Law</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>The Story of Exodus and the Reality of Unfreedom</strong><ul><li>&ldquo;&mldr;[W]e have constructed patterns in our lives&ndash;patterns in relationships, patterns at work, and so often, self-defeating patterns, which undermine our best interests&mldr;There is always a &rsquo;logical&rsquo; connection between a surface symptom or pattern and a historic wounding to the soul.&rdquo; - <em>James Hollis, Finding Meaning in the Second Half of Life, 2005</em></li><li><strong><a class="internal-link broken">Ignatian Spirituality</a> and the Reality of Unfreedom</strong><ul><li>We can see these self-defeating patterns&mldr;this form of slavery&mldr;as a invitation to greater awareness</li><li>&ldquo;With much &lsquo;unfreedom&rsquo; in us we will never be able to do serious discernment and we will just continue to be at the mercy of our attachments.&rdquo; <em>- Ramon Maria Luza Bautista, S.J., Schooled by the Spirit, 2009</em></li></ul></li><li>&ldquo;Where is your brother?&rdquo; (Gen 4:9). Where is your brother or sister who is enslaved? Where is the brother and sister whom you are killing each day in clandestine warehouses, in rings of prostitution, in children used for begging, in exploiting undocumented labour? Let us not look the other way&mldr;The issue involves everyone!" <em>- Pope Francis, Evangelii Gaudium #211</em><ul><li>Pope Francis wishes for all of us to hear God&rsquo;s cry.</li><li>He tells us not to look the other way, because these issues involve everyone.</li><li>Reflect on the question of slavery that is amidst us: Who are our brothers and sisters? The ones whose lives have been made bitter by oppression?</li><li>The invitation for greater awareness is not again meant to bring us to a dark place, but really an invitation for deeper compassion and for deeper solidarity</li></ul></li><li><strong>The Cry</strong><ul><li>&ldquo;The Isarelites groaned under their slavery, and cried out&mldr;. [T]heir cry for help rose up to God. God heard their groaning&mldr; remembered his covenant&mldr;and took notice of them&rdquo; (Ex. 2:23-25)</li><li>The crying out is important because without the crying out, you just end up returning to Egypt. You just end up returning to slavery. The crying out, it&rsquo;s not just an expression of misery you knowthe crying out is also a complaint it&rsquo;salso a protestit&rsquo;s also an acknowledgement that thingsare not rightthe crying out is the first sign ofopenness to the hopeful expectationthat slavery is not the last wordi</li><li>E.G. Student praying to God in a retreat about her anger and resentment towards her parents. By acknowledging these (and thus lifting these up to God), she felt that she had the opportunity to start anew.</li><li>That&rsquo;s what tears are all about. They are an acknowledgement that one needs to be saved.</li><li>Insight #2: <strong>The basic requirement of freedom is the awareness of &ldquo;exile&rdquo;, the groan of conscious alienation.</strong> <em>- Avivag Gottlieb Zornberg</em> <a class="internal-link broken">Freedom requires awareness of exile</a><ul><li>Before one can be free, one must be aware that one is not free. That awareness is manifested in the crying out.</li><li><a href=/Cards/Freedom-is-being-conscious-of-your-constraints rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Cards/Freedom-is-being-conscious-of-your-constraints>Cards/Freedom is being conscious of your constraints</a></li><li><a href=/Cards/The-alternative-to-freedom-is-unconsciousness rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Cards/The-alternative-to-freedom-is-unconsciousness>Cards/The alternative to freedom is unconsciousness</a></li></ul></li><li><strong>Ignatian Spirituality and Self-Awareness</strong><ul><li>Saint <a class="internal-link broken">Ignatius of Loyola</a> says that one of the temptations of the evil spirit is to tell us to keep your weakness in the dark. Just keep it hidden, don&rsquo;t let it be known. But we know the change begins when we are able to bring our weakness into the light.</li><li>&ldquo;As <a class="internal-link broken">Ignatius of Loyola</a> observes, the enemy of human nature does fear discovery. While our weaknesses remain unacknowledged or closeted away, we are powerless over them. The sometimes painful process of dragging our weaknesses into full light of day by understanding them is the first empowering stride toward conquering them.&rdquo; <em>- Chris Lowney, Heroic Leadership, 2003</em></li><li>Related to insights from #DLQ10<ul><li><a href=/Cards/The-wound-is-the-place-where-the-Light-enters-you rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Cards/The-wound-is-the-place-where-the-Light-enters-you>Cards/The wound is the place where the Light enters you</a></li><li><a href=/Cards/Brokenness rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Cards/Brokenness>Cards/Brokenness</a></li></ul></li></ul></li><li>&ldquo;When the heart is able to ask itself and weep, then we can understand something&mldr; Dear young boys and girls, today&rsquo;s world doesn&rsquo;t know how to cry&mldr;<a class="internal-link broken">Certain realities of life we only see through eyes cleansed by our tears</a>. I invite each one here to ask yourself: ==have I learned how to weep?== Have I learned how to weep for the marginated or for a street child who has a drug problem or for an abused child?&rdquo; <em>- Pope Francis, Message to Filipino Youth at UST, 18 Janurary 2015</em></li><li>The cry is pivotal in opening the gates that make freedom and liberation possible.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>The Call of Moses</strong><ul><li>&ldquo;The cry of the Isarelites has now come to me; I have also seen how the Egyptians oppress them. So come, I will send you to Pharaoh to bring my people, the Isarelites, out of Egypt.&rdquo; (Ex. 3:9-10)</li><li>Certain formula in the Bible: people are called by God, and they object to this.</li><li>Moses objects to God 5 times. Roberto finds Moses&rsquo; call fascinating because it&rsquo;s as if the Lord throughout that entire process was shaping his heart, shaping his heart to make it more docile to the promptings of the Lord&rsquo;s spirit.</li><li>Insight #3: <strong><a class="internal-link broken">God calls each of us to the vocation of freedom</a>.</strong></li></ul></li><li><strong>The Summons to Vocation</strong><ul><li>&ldquo;God calls you to make definitive choices, and He has a plan each of you: to discover that plan and to respond to your vocation is to move toward personal fulfillment.&rdquo; <em>- Pope Francis, World Youth Day 2013</em></li><li>When we ask questions such as &ldquo;What is the meaning of my life?&rdquo;, &ldquo;Why was I created?&rdquo;, &ldquo;Why am I here?&rdquo;, &ldquo;This one life I have&mldr;what am I being invited to gamble it on?&rdquo;&mldr;we enter the realm of vocation. ==Where are we being someone to?==</li><li>&ldquo;The Christian vocation, rooted in the contemplation of the Father&rsquo;s heart, &mldr; inspires us to solidarity in bringing liberation to our brothers and sisters, especially the poorest.&rdquo; <em>- Pope Francis, World Day of Prayer for Vocations, 26 April 2015</em><ul><li>Vocation is not just personal.</li><li>This reminds us that the question is not just at this point in my life &ldquo;Am I more free?&rdquo; An equally important question is: &ldquo;Are others, especially the poorest among us, more free because of me?&rdquo;</li></ul></li><li>&ldquo;God calls you to the place where your deep gladness and the world&rsquo;s deep hunger meet.&rdquo; <em>- Frederick Bucchner</em><ul><li>Reminds us that vocation is not just my deepest gladness and my deepest joys (See <a class="internal-link broken">Ignatian Spirituality</a> and <a href=/Cards/Desire rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Cards/Desire>Cards/Desire</a>), but rather ==the intersection of my deepest desires and the world&rsquo;s deepest hungers.==</li></ul></li><li>&ldquo;The meaning of your life is to find your gift. The purpose of your life is to give it away.&rdquo; <em>- Pablo Picasso</em></li></ul></li><li><strong>For Reflection and Prayer</strong><ul><li>How would you describe your inner journey these past years. Take time to recall the most significant lights and shadows of your journey.</li><li>Reflecting upon your life and deepest desires, what do you think you are being called to doz.</li><li>What would you consider the &lsquo;Egypt&rsquo; that enslaves you? How do these affect you, your relationships, work, and life?</li></ul></li></ul><h5 id=magisterial-lectures--roberto-conrado-guevara-phd---on-journeys--crossroads-story-of-our-liveshttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvk0-p7sky1tsfeatureyoutube><a rel=noopener class="internal-link broken" data-src=#ZgotmplZ>Magisterial Lectures | Roberto Conrado Guevara Phd - On Journeys & Crossroads: Story of Our Lives</a></h5><ul><li><strong>Crossing the Sea: From Slavery to Freedom, Death to Life</strong><ul><li>&ldquo;What have you done to us, bringing us out of Egypt! Is rhis not the very thing we told you in Egypt, &lsquo;Let us alone and let us serve the Egyptians?&rsquo; For it would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the wilderness.&rdquo; <em>- Exodus 14:1-14</em><ul><li>Why did the Isarelies miss Egypt? Perhaps because of fear.</li></ul></li><li>Insight #4: <strong><a class="internal-link broken">What makes change difficult is fear</a>. If you want to live in mediocrity, then live in fear.</strong> <em>- Fr. Venacio Calpotura SJ</em><ul><li><a class="internal-link broken">Mediocrity stems from fear</a></li></ul></li><li>&ldquo;Fear governs so much of our lives&mldr;Standing up to our fear is perhaps the most critical decision necessary in the governsnce of our life&mldr;&rdquo; <em>- James Hollis, Finding Meaning in the Second Half of Life, 2005</em></li><li>James Hollis states that one of the most common ways fear can be in charge will be found in ==our flight from personal responsibility.==<ul><li>What does one do when one is afraid? Blaming and scapegoating.</li><li>This is exactly what the Isarelites did with Moses.</li><li>When one is afraid, one lets go of responsibility.</li><li>But we can choose to stand up to our fears instead.</li></ul></li><li>&ldquo;There is a temptation that says it is &lsquo;better to stay here,&rsquo; where I&rsquo;m safe. But this is the slavery of Egypt: &lsquo;I fear moving forward, I&rsquo;m afraid of where the Lord will bring me.&rsquo; Fear, however, &lsquo;is not a good counselor.&rsquo;&rdquo; <em>- Pope Francis, Courage in Spite of Our Weakness, 2 July 2013</em></li><li>Hollis also says that the other by-product of fear is lethargy: the lack of energy, the lack of enthusiasm, the lack of the will to move forward, to dream, to imagine.<ul><li>We are tempted to give in, to be immobilized by fear.</li></ul></li><li>Moses&rsquo; response: &ldquo;Fear not, stand firm, and <em>see</em> the salvation of the Lord, which he will work for you today; for the Egyptians whom you <em>see</em> today, you shall never <em>see</em> again. The Lord will fight for you, and you have only to be still.&rdquo;<ul><li>Moses uses the word see 3 times. This was probably deliberate because you have to remember that what caused Israel&rsquo;s fear was what they looked at. What caused their fear was what they saw. Moses is telling them to not look at the sources of your fearr. Change what you&rsquo;re looking at. Rather than look at your fear, look at what the Lord will do for you today.</li></ul></li><li>Insight #5: <strong>To lead involves helping one&rsquo;s self and others &lsquo;see&rsquo; things in a new light.</strong> <a class="internal-link broken">Leadership involves helping yourself and others see things in a new light</a><ul><li>Moses was a leader to the Isarelites because he taught them to see themselves and reality in a new way.</li></ul></li><li>&ldquo;May your choices reflect your hopes, not your fears.&rdquo; <em>- Nelson Mandela</em><ul><li>Same act of looking, but you decide what you look at</li></ul></li><li>Prevalent method of leadership: making people fixate on their fears. Is this necessary?

When more &ldquo;modern&rdquo; systems of wealth creation were possible, such as learning a trade and selling your products, or inventing something and employing workers to produce, it was no longer the monarch that was in power but ==those who could have power over production, selling, and of course, earning.==</li><li>In this system, the poor were no longer tenant farmers but factory workers, cogs in a wheel of production. Now, not everyone is a factory worker but the same system is visible even in corporations, where the &ldquo;lower tier&rdquo; workers are paid less than those on top. The problem with this relationship is ==the work that a person does does not equal what the person earns and someone (or someones) on the top earn the most for doing the least work.==</li><li>So, the question that we are forced to confront is <em>what is the value of a person? And how is that value made possible?</em> Or, we can change these questions to <em>how is the worth of a person determined by their relationship to a system of production</em>?</li></ul><a href=#government-systems-and-marxist-critique><h4 id=government-systems-and-marxist-critique><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Government systems and Marxist critique</h4></a><ul><li>If the world is founded on an unfair system, why is it that people don&rsquo;t rebel? Marx argued that eventually, the lowest worker, the proletariat, would rebel.</li><li>Marx liked that idea of uniting all the workers of the world, who united in an ideology of equality, would break all hierarchies that kept inequalities in place. In such a new system, ==everyone earned as much as they worked. ==</li><li>And, with State holding all the funds, there would be ==a stronger sense of equitability&ndash;a kind of institutionalized &ldquo;sharing&rdquo;.== In this system, wealth would be fairly distributed and everyone would have equal opportunities.</li><li>The world has seen at least two major Communist economies, China and Russia, with Cuba too, but it&rsquo;s not clear to what extent this system worked, following the intentions of Marx. But that does not mean Marxist thought can&rsquo;t be applied, which is why, in intellectual circles, we have what is referred to as <strong>&ldquo;Marxist critique&rdquo;</strong>, which is ==a theoretical and practical means of challenging power and resisting the inequalities that characterize our society today.== (See <a class="internal-link broken">Marxism</a>)</li><li>Challenging inequality is not easy and successes are few and hard to come by. Have you ever been conscious of how inequalities impact on the totality of our lives? And have you ever heard of or participated in movements that attempt to resist and challenge these inequalities?

So for many reasons, the our births seem accidental&ndash;we may have been born in burgis families, just as others may have been born in poorer or even wealthier families. But, ==that accident of birth has <em>birthed</em> into the conditions that formed us today. ==</li><li>Marx has also written about how invisible social systems keep the rich, rich, and the poor, poor. If we believe that, then who are now has everything to do with class we were born into. Do reflect on your lives and try to see to what extent this might be true for you.</li><li>Since systems that ensure the UNEQUAL distribution of power and wealth are invisible, ==we have accepted them.== The concept of <em><a class="internal-link broken">Hegemony</a></em>, which was thought up by an Italian thinker, Antonio Gramsci, means that &ldquo;we are oppressed without knowing it&rdquo; or &ldquo;we are oppressed and we have accepted it&rdquo; or &ldquo;we have <em>consented</em> to the system, and we don&rsquo;t know it&rdquo;. ==So we are happily oppressed.==</li><li>Have you ever felt like you had already agreed to an invisible form of oppression?

On the contrary, Marxist thought and critique are still very useful, if they are framed within a view toward making things better for all.</li><li>What Marxist critique does is ==it makes visible the invisible systems of power and inequality.== ==And that is what literature, art, music, film, can do.== Through these forms of creative expression, writers, artists, thinkers, and anyone who feels compelled to do so, can articulate what is invisible and reveal how systems of power have hurt and impacted on all of our lives. </li><li>But ==critique has to be deployed in light of concrete action==&ndash;at least that is how I see it. For example if an system of gender inequality is revealed through films on LGBTQ++, then what are we supposed to do? What can we do to make things more fair? </li><li>At this point, it&rsquo;s important to consider what <em>power</em> means. To me, power equals access and choice. And these are not available to all. Why is that? Why are some more powerful than others?</li></ul><a href=#the-twin-concepts-of-fragmentation-and-alienation><h4 id=the-twin-concepts-of-fragmentation-and-alienation><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>The twin concepts of fragmentation and alienation</h4></a><ul><li>Because we are all conditioned socially into certain positions, there is a chance of all of us experiencing <em><a class="internal-link broken">Fragmentation</a></em> and <em><a class="internal-link broken">Alienation</a></em>, which result from us ==being forced in &ldquo;a place&rdquo; in the system which we don&rsquo;t like.== The result is, a fragmented person, who is at odds with themselves and/or an <em>alienated</em> one, who feels dispossessed, disenfranchised and marginalized by the system.</li><li>For example, students carry the burden of earning money for themselves and for their families. That can be a fragmenting moment, especially if the student does not want to earn in the manner their parents conditioned them to. That situation can also be alienating for the student who feels like their life was &ldquo;made&rdquo; for them but does not agree with what was made. It does take wisdom and growing up to deal with such a situation, if it&rsquo;s even possible to deal with them.</li><li>In other words, because of a social system that invisibly keeps us all in our place, ==we wind up with internal problems.== The system conditions us to the point where we accept the system. And that is one reason why Jung says we have no sense of self-knowledge. ==The true self, after all, may be a problem to the system because it may not at all cooperate.==</li><li>But, one is tempted to ask whether the chance for self-knowledge is also equally distributed.</li></ul><a href=#reading-brave-new-world><h4 id=reading-brave-new-world><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Reading &ldquo;Brave new world&rdquo;</h4></a><p>Huxley&rsquo;s novel is certainly a brave one!
