Here&rsquo;s a brief overview: <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbT6IkMQxck" rel=noopener>A Mini Guide to Medieval Monks</a></strong></p><blockquote><p>There were many different religious communities in medieval Britain. Many of English Heritageâs religious sites were once home to one of the four major monastic movements â the Benedictines, Cluniacs, Carthusians and Cistercians. But do you know the difference between these religious orders?</p></blockquote><ul><li><strong>Benedictines</strong><ul><li>At the core of the Benedictine day was communal prayer; everyday the monks gathered in church to sing eight services</li><li>Time was also set aside for reading and manual work</li><li>Monasteries also had an obligation to offer hospitality to travellers and alms to the poor</li><li>The Rule of St. Benedict was summed up with the motto &ldquo;Pray and Work&rdquo;</li></ul></li><li><strong>Cluniacs</strong><ul><li>The Cluniacs wanted a grander style of worship. So their interpretation of the Rule called for a celebration of God through beautiful art, architecture, and elaborate services.</li><li>Servants did most of the manual labor</li></ul></li><li><strong>Cistercians</strong><ul><li>The Cluniac life was too opulent for the Cistercians</li><li>Monasteries were plain and secluded</li><li>Services were shorter, and they farmed and carried out their own manual labor</li><li>Aim: simpler, more austere spiritual life</li></ul></li><li><strong>Carthusians</strong><ul><li>The most austere out of all the orders</li><li>Wore hooded robes, only came together for a few services each day, and unlike other orders, lived and prayed in solitary cells</li></ul></li><li>Henry VIII suddenly dissolved all the moansteries; this forced those who committed to religious communities to step out into an uncertain future</li></ul><a href=#the-6-key-features-of-monasticism-lecture><h5 id=the-6-key-features-of-monasticism-lecture><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>The 6 Key Features of <a class="internal-link broken">Monasticism</a> Lecture</h5></a><ul><li><a class="internal-link broken">Monasticism</a> comes from the Greek word <em><strong>monos</strong></em>, meaning <strong>alone</strong>.<ul><li>Sets the context for <a class="internal-link broken">Monasticism</a>, since this is a form of education born from the experiences of monks who secluded themselves from the rest of society</li></ul></li><li>6 Key Features<ul><li><strong>Aim:</strong> ==&ldquo;salvation of individual souls&rdquo;==<ul><li>Context: this type of education was a response to the degrading quality of Christianity</li><li>Through&mldr; (methods)<ul><li>Bodily mortification</li><li>World renunciation &ndash; chastity, poverty, obedience<ul><li>Described as <strong><a href=/Permanent-Notes/Ascetism rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Permanent-Notes/Ascetism>Permanent Notes/Ascetism</a>:</strong> the ==disciplining== of all ==bodily desires== and ==all human affections and aspirations== so that the mind and soul might be devoted to the interests of the higher life.</li><li>This works with the assumption that the higher life cannot mix with the worldly life</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Type:</strong> Moral and Religious education<ul><li>Types of training<ul><li>Literary Training: reading, copying, and writing of manuscripts</li><li>Manual Training: agriculture (for men), skilled artisanship (wood, metal, leather), embroidery</li></ul></li><li>Motivation behind these<ul><li>Rule of Benedict: &ldquo;==Idleness is the great enemy== of the soul, therefore the monks shall always be occupied either in manual labor or holy reading&rdquo;</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Content:</strong> Seven Liberal Arts (grammar, rhetoric, dialectic, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, music)<ul><li>Also done in service of the church/religion<ul><li>&ldquo;The novitates were required to learn to ==read== in order to ==study the sacred books==; to ==write== in order to ==copy manuscripts==; to ==sing== in order to take part in ==religious ceremonies==; and to ==calculate== so that they could ==compute the time of the church festivals==&rdquo;</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Agency & Organization:</strong> Monastic schools<ul><li>Boys admitted at age 10, and enters the order at 18</li><li>Later on, &ldquo;outsiders&rdquo; were admitted too <em>(interni v.s. externi)</em><ul><li>Externi: those coming from the external world</li><li>Interni: those who decided to stay to continue living a religious life</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Method:</strong><ul><li>Cathethical: question & answer method</li><li>Dictation: since they had limited copies of the manuscripts</li><li>Meditation & Contemplation</li><li>Corporal Punishment (use of the rod)</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Takeaway question: Who was the <strong>educated person</strong> in <a class="internal-link broken">Monasticism</a>?</li><li>Finally, to deepen your understanding, read more about Monastic Education, you may do so inÂ this excerpt.</li></ul><blockquote><ol><li>What feature of Monastic Education did you find most interesting? Include a brief quote from the text about this.</li><li>Describe the educated person in monastic education.</li></ol></blockquote><p>What I found most interesting about Monastic Education was the motivation behind keeping the monks constantly busy. This was because they worried that having too much free time could make one vulnerable to &ldquo;tempation or brooding&rdquo;. As declared by the Rule of Benedict: &ldquo;Idleness is the great enemy of the soul.&rdquo; I can&rsquo;t help but think of how similar this aim is to modern productivity culture, where people try to optimize their time in order to do as much as possible; workaholics like me are most guilty of this.</p><p>The educated person in monastic education is a single-minded devotee. Similar to the Spartans, who dedicated their whole lives to the state, educated monks dedicated their whole lives to God. They sacrificed their bodies (through phsical torment) and relationships (with the home, economy, and state); they believed that this would free them from worldy tempations, which would allow them to fully focus on studying and serving God (which can be seen in the purely religious content of their education).</p><a href=#the-scholastic-faith-and-reason><h4 id=the-scholastic-faith-and-reason><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>The scholastic: Faith and Reason</h4></a><blockquote><p>Let&rsquo;s start this section with this question:Â What is the relationship of <strong>faith</strong> and <strong>reason?</strong></p></blockquote><p><img src="/images/Look at something beautiful for a long time.png" width=auto></p><ul><li>The late middle period (11th to 12th century) was a time of peace andÂ  intellectual activities.Â  People now began to speculate about Church doctrines, which were previously accepted unquestioningly.
