Here&rsquo;s a brief overview: <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbT6IkMQxck" rel=noopener>A Mini Guide to Medieval Monks</a></strong></p><blockquote><p>There were many different religious communities in medieval Britain.

But do you know the difference between these religious orders?</p></blockquote><ul><li><strong>Benedictines</strong><ul><li>At the core of the Benedictine day was communal prayer; everyday the monks gathered in church to sing eight services</li><li>Time was also set aside for reading and manual work</li><li>Monasteries also had an obligation to offer hospitality to travellers and alms to the poor</li><li>The Rule of St. Benedict was summed up with the motto &ldquo;Pray and Work&rdquo;</li></ul></li><li><strong>Cluniacs</strong><ul><li>The Cluniacs wanted a grander style of worship.

Include a brief quote from the text about this.</li><li>Describe the educated person in monastic education.</li></ol></blockquote><p>What I found most interesting about Monastic Education was the motivation behind keeping the monks constantly busy. This was because they worried that having too much free time could make one vulnerable to &ldquo;tempation or brooding&rdquo;. As declared by the Rule of Benedict: &ldquo;Idleness is the great enemy of the soul.&rdquo; I can&rsquo;t help but think of how similar this aim is to modern productivity culture, where people try to optimize their time in order to do as much as possible; workaholics like me are most guilty of this.</p><p>The educated person in monastic education is a single-minded devotee. Similar to the Spartans, who dedicated their whole lives to the state, educated monks dedicated their whole lives to God. They sacrificed their bodies (through phsical torment) and relationships (with the home, economy, and state); they believed that this would free them from worldy tempations, which would allow them to fully focus on studying and serving God (which can be seen in the purely religious content of their education).</p><a href=#the-scholastic-faith-and-reason><h4 id=the-scholastic-faith-and-reason><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>The scholastic: Faith and Reason</h4></a><blockquote><p>Let&rsquo;s start this section with this question: What is the relationship of <strong>faith</strong> and <strong>reason?</strong></p></blockquote><p><img src="/images/Look at something beautiful for a long time.png" width=auto></p><ul><li>The late middle period (11th to 12th century) was a time of peace and  intellectual activities.  People now began to speculate about Church doctrines, which were previously accepted unquestioningly. This resulted in pursuing theology with more vigor and hence the start of scholasticism as a movement.  <a class="internal-link broken">Scholasticism</a> aimed to ==support the doctrines of the church using rational argument.==</li><li>Malik Shawal in his article
