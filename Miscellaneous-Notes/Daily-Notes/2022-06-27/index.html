The signifier, in general, is what we perceive and experience, while the signified is the meaning the the signifier pertains to. In this arrangement, the signifier <em>points to</em> the signified. It must be noted, additionally, that we make sense of the world through the use of signs, and that signs get their meaning through differentiation with other signs in the same system. In this way, we also say that the relationship between sign and meaning is arbitrary rather than fixed, given, or immutable.</p><p><strong>Code</strong>
Codes refer to conventions that govern sign systems, which may range from the very strict and precise to the informal and vague.</p><p><strong>Myth</strong></p><p>Roland Barthes introduces the idea of mythologies or myth-making, which he describes beginning with <strong>denotation</strong> and <strong>connotation</strong>.</p><p>Denotation refers to primary signification or <em>surface meaning</em>. Connotation, meanwhile, refers to secondary signification. Barthes argues that it is at the level of secondary signification that myth is made for consumption. More importantly, mythology deals with the production of <strong>ideology</strong>, wherein it is understood as a body of ideas and practices which defend the prevailing structure of power by actively promoting the values and interests of dominant groups in society.</p><p>This makes way to give historical intention a natural justification.</p><a href=#codes><h4 id=codes><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Codes</h4></a><ul><li>Conventions (rules) governing sign systems</li><li>May be precise, such as grammatical rules that govern language or vague/changeable, delimited by history and context</li><li>Link signs together in ways that reflect a particular interpretation of a community&rsquo;s system of values, myths, and ideologies</li></ul><a href=#myths><h4 id=myths><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Myths</h4></a><a href=#ronald-barthes-mythologies><h5 id=ronald-barthes-mythologies><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Ronald Barthes: Mythologies</h5></a><ul><li>adds: denotation and conotation</li><li>at the level of secondary signification or conotation, myth is made for consumption</li></ul><a href=#general><h5 id=general><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>General</h5></a><ul><li>mythic signs reinforce dominant values</li><li>ideological signs enlist support for the status quo by transforming history into nature; pretending the current conditions are, and always have been, the natural order of things</li><li>deals with the production of ideology</li><li><strong>&ldquo;Ideology&rdquo;</strong> is understood as a ==body of ideas and practices which defend the prevailing structure of power== by actively promoting the values/interest of dominant groups in society</li><li>gives historical intention</li></ul><a href=#critical-theory><h4 id=critical-theory><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Critical Theory</h4></a><ul><li>An <strong>ethically heightened</strong> and <strong>politically reflective</strong> study of the relationships between <strong>power, knowledge,</strong> and <strong>discourse</strong> that are produced in contexts of <strong>historical</strong> and <strong>cultural struggle.</strong><ul><li>takes inspiration from Marxism and structuralism</li></ul></li><li>All thought is fundamentally mediated by power relations that are socially/historically constituted</li><li>The relation between concept and object between signifier and signified is never stable or fixed and is oftern mediated by social relations of capitalist production and consumption</li><li>Scrutinizes the role of cultural institutions in the production of ideological discourse</li></ul><a href=#isa-and-hegemony><h4 id=isa-and-hegemony><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>ISA and Hegemony</h4></a><ul><li>ISA: Ideological state appratuses</li><li>&ldquo;[C]ultural members ==make choices in the context of a life-world whose options for meaning have always already been shaped by ideology.== They experience themselves as exercising agency in making choices and sometimes even as resisting cultural authority.&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;They are not aware, however, of the ==options that have been rendered literally unthinkable by dominant ideologies== — moved beyond the rim of the conceivable or legitimate.&rdquo;</li></ul><a href=#towards-critical-theory><h4 id=towards-critical-theory><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Towards Critical Theory</h4></a><ul><li><strong>Marxist:</strong> ==socio-economic approach== (base/superstructure, class struggle, ideology)</li><li><strong>Semiotics:</strong> ==structural approach== (the study of signs, codes, and the production of myths)</li><li><strong>Critical theory:</strong> concerned with the ==production of ideology== (knowledge, power, and discourse, within the context of struggle)</li></ul><a href=#postmodern-critical-theory><h4 id=postmodern-critical-theory><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Postmodern Critical Theory</h4></a><ul><li>Disintegration of colonial systems</li><li>Advent of the information age</li><li>Globalization</li><li>Dismantling/reassembling of cultures</li><li>Loss of faith in &ldquo;foundational&rdquo; metanarratives</li><li>Instability of identities</li></ul><a href=#cultural-studies><h4 id=cultural-studies><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Cultural Studies</h4></a><ul><li><strong>Cultural economy:</strong> the blending of the traditional meanings of text and commodity</li><li>Exploring the relationship between an ==object&rsquo;s <em>official</em> value== and its ==unofficial potential for generating meaning and supporting beliefs==</li><li>Culture is seen as the ==site of struggle==</li><li>Power/knowledge are discursively produced</li></ul><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXuK6gekU1Y" rel=noopener><strong>AlphaGo Documentary</strong></a>

This can be seen in so much aspects of the film, like its narratives and conditions.</p><p>First, the characters. The protagonists featured here are Vic, a disabled veteran who sculpts, and Tita, a prostitute caring for her brother. Both of them were social outcasts struggling with money, which forced them to work in unfavorable conditions, like smuggling money and dancing in clubs. But they stayed strong for the sake of love, whether it be for their family or for each other. Love has always been a driving motivator for Filipinos, especially because of a culture that values close ties so much. Next, the environment. Both of these characters were trying to survive in the slums of a materialistic post-war Manila. It could be also said that the film&rsquo;s workers were doing the same thing; working in the post-war Filipino industry (still reeling from the effects of Japan&rsquo;s occupation and the Cold War), they were trying to make the most out of considerable budgetary limitations. It seemed like everyone had to be resilient for this film, from the characters to the film workers.</p><p>Perhaps this was an intentional choice of director Lamberto Avellana, whose style is realism. This was atypical of Filipino films at the same time. Unlike most directors, Avellana didn&rsquo;t resort to major box-office names and singing/dancing performances. Instead, he&rsquo;d go all-in on realism: casting minor box-office actors, choosing poverty and crime a sa theme, filming in people&rsquo;s houses, etc. This stark deviation from the norm is probably what led the movie to fail in the box office. However, it got critical acclaim: it was chosen as the Philippine entry in the Oscars, and won the Golden Harvest for Best Film Award at the Asia-Pacific Film Festival. So maybe resilience does pay off in the end.</p><p>What&rsquo;s my personal take? To be honest, I&rsquo;m iffy with Filipino resilience because it has a problematic nature — it takes accountability away from our government, the main entity responsible for taking care of its citizens in times of distress. It also dehumanizes the victims of these situations. However, I didn&rsquo;t feel disgusted watching Anak Dalita, even if it can technically be considered &ldquo;poverty porn&rdquo;. It ended up touching me instead. I think it was because the film allowed me to really get to know the characters. I could empathize with them because they felt so real to me — to the point that they felt like real human beings. If they could push through their ordeals, then maybe I could too. This kind of connection is the magic of film at work.</p><p>One piece of dialogue that best encapsulates my appreciation of Jaclyn Jose&rsquo;s performance was this line from her interview: &ldquo;Pero pinakatumatak siya sa kanyang signature acting: ang underacting, o yung parang bang, hindi umaarte.&rdquo; She brought this style to all her roles, but this can especially be seen in her role as Ma&rsquo; Rosa: a mother and sari-sari owner who has to sell illegal drugs to make ends meet. In the film, she gets arrested by the police, and her children have to bail her out. I&rsquo;m sure that there are many poverty-stricken Filipinos who can relate to this experience (committing crimes just to survive), especially in an administration infamous for its anti-drug agenda and EJKs. Director Brillante Mendoza would often portray urban poor experiences like this, like joining a syndicate or taking care of adopted children. His films would often be win local and international awards, such as Cannes. I think his films are always critically acclaimed because of how&mldr;natural they are. He&rsquo;s able to not only reflect the harsh reality of many Filipino lives; he&rsquo;s also able to tell stories that universally resonate, as seen with Jaclyn Jose&rsquo;s natural portrayal of Ma&rsquo;Rosa, a mother who&rsquo;d do anything for her kids. Personally, what I take away from all of this is that we are our most successful when we&rsquo;re truly authentic. Connection is only possible when we&rsquo;re fully ourselves.</p><p><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamberto_V._Avellana rel=noopener>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamberto_V._Avellana</a>

They&rsquo;re both situated in the slums of Manila, and centered around people who live there. They all have to resort to dirty work (e.g. prostitution, money laundering, selling drugs) just so they remain financially capable of staying there. They&rsquo;re willing to put in so much effort for these poverty-stricken places because it&rsquo;s their only home. Despite their low status, these &ldquo;&mldr;slum inhabitants are crucial to the production of the city space, even as they are rendered invisible by those who own and control the formal means of producing space&rdquo; (Macapagal, 2021). The developed cities many of us live in wouldn&rsquo;t be where they are today without the invisible labor of the poor. They are our family caretakers, sari-sari store owners, construction workers, and more. But we often take them for granted because we&rsquo;ve gotten so used to their presence, to the point that they&rsquo;re hidden to us. That&rsquo;s why I appreciate slum chronotype films like Anak Dalita and Ma&rsquo;Rosa; they humanize the marginalized by spotlighting their stories, helping us empathize with them.</p></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li><a href=/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2023-01-26/ data-ctx="Miscellaneous Notes/Daily Notes/2022-06-27" data-src=/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2023-01-26 class=internal-link>2023-01-26</a></li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://garden.bianca.digital/js/graph.abd4bc2af3869a96524d7d23b76152c7.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by Bianca Aguilar using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, © 2023</p><ul><li><a href=https://garden.bianca.digital/>Home</a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/biancamikaila>Twitter</a></li><li><a href=https://are.na/bianca-aguilar>Are.na</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
