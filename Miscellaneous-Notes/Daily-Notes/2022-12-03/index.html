Although this “concept” emerges from the Philippine context, the ideas may be relatable to or extended in contexts where sources of collective imaginaries are comparable.</li><li>In the process of coaching, labor influencers also cascade imaginaries of success to their audiences&mldr;These imaginaries of success can be seen as a modern form of “coaching” manifested through self-branding techniques such as repetition styles and sharing of personal narratives.</li><li>While [digital labor influencers] play a crucial role in helping workers make sense of platform labor when they have no better alternatives nor access to similar forms of dynamic guidance elsewhere, they also cascade imaginaries that workers hang on to, as these nurture their economic and social aspirations, whether these latter are realized or not. It is in the heart of such contradictions that platform workers imagine new forms of sociability, visions of happiness, and economic capacities, despite uncertainty on whether these can in fact be actualized (de Peuter et al., 2017). This implies that they also perform the role not only of bridging workers with each other, but bridging workers with platforms, essentially performing unpaid labor for digital platforms. It follows that they also serve as promoters of the Philippine government’s vision of promoting Filipinos as “world class workers” while allowing it (along with digital platforms) to avoid its responsibility to attend to the deeper structures of labor inequality.</li><li>TL;DR by cultivating aspirations these influencers also help sustain inequities</li></ul></li><li></li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Developing countries and tech<ul><li>The Innovation Paradox<ul><li><a href=https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/28341/211160ov.pdf rel=noopener>https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/28341/211160ov.pdf</a></li><li><a href="https://academic.oup.com/book/26367/chapter-abstract/194692883?redirectedFrom=fulltext" rel=noopener>https://academic.oup.com/book/26367/chapter-abstract/194692883?redirectedFrom=fulltext</a><ul><li>limited mental model of labor</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><a href=https://eujournalfuturesresearch.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40309-021-00171-6 rel=noopener>Participatory foresight and reflexive innovation: setting policy goals and developing strategies in a bottom-up, mission-oriented, sustainable way</a><ul><li>EXHIBIT, METHOD</li><li>We might further consider how narrative generation can facilitate in bringing lofty, but ambiguous, goals back within the sphere of everyday life. In so doing, these stories can utilize various concepts (technological, legal, organizational, etc.) to illustrate how a future imaginary might impact the life choices and daily routines of a vibrant citizenry.</li></ul></li><li>Technology of the Oppressed: Inequity and the Digital Mundane in Favelas of Brazil<ul><li>inspiration for speculative design process probably&mldr;.Mundane Technology</li><li>Scholars and technology designers have often perceived the oppressed as mere consumers of technologies rather than as agents empowered by them (Rangaswamy and Cutrell 2012). This tension between oppression and empowerment turns digital technologies—as with every aspect of the life of the oppressed—into a site of struggle, revealing the structural violence of the information age. Rendering such oppression visible makes it available for intervention and change (Eubanks 2012). After seeing how his neighborhood was framed online, Pedro became more aware of the biases of digital platforms. But in order for people like him to survive, they need to consciously resist oppressions and appropriate technology rather than reject it.</li><li>Technology is not a separate world—it is an extension of the struggles we all face. Thus, in this book, I explore ==how people critically appropriate technologies to navigate both digital and nondigital sources of oppression==. To guide this exploration, I borrow Paulo Freire’s notion of oppression, which he defines as acts of exploitation and violence and a failure “to recognize others as persons” (2000, 55). Over the course of the book, I will evolve and mature Freire’s rather vague notion of oppression, building a framework around the challenges that favela residents encounter. This framework represents how I understand the role of digital technologies in favelas: Residents grapple with daily challenges from specific axes of oppression in their lives. ==Appropriating Mundane Technologies is their act of hope; they use technology to seek liberation.== Therefore, we need to shift our understanding of the role of technology in oppressive situations.</li><li>Freire’s invitation to others to reinvent his ideas inspired me to develop a framework that seeks to understand why digital technologies can be simultaneously sites of oppression and tools that can be appropriated by the oppressed in their pursuit of freedom. I use the term Mundane Technology to describe this framework. It doesn’t provide a method or a set of techniques to liberate the oppressed, nor it is a pedagogical plan. Rather, I conceptualize Mundane Technology as an episteme to understand oppression and Freire’s process of conscientização in the information age. Similar to Virginia Eubanks and her arguments in Digital Dead End (2012), I believe that oppression should be the central diagnostic for technology. Using oppression as an outcome of concern allows us to see complex processes of exploitation, marginalization, powerlessness, cultural imperialism, and violence as centrally driving inequities of the information age. Identifying and calling out these systems of domination illuminate opportunities for intervention and change</li><li>Thus, Mundane Technologies—as appropriations of everyday technologies—are how technology is reinterpreted, adapted, and reinvented by those outside these centers of power in order to achieve liberation from oppression. Approaching Mundane Technologies as appropriations of technology opens new research avenues for culture and technology and contributes to a renewed concern for democracy</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Colonialism<ul><li><a href="http://umu.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1249539&dswid=702" rel=noopener>Journeys of Displacement Between South and North: Decolonizing a Designer Imaginary</a></li><li><a href=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10606-021-09398-0 rel=noopener>Challenges and Paradoxes in Decolonising HCI: A Critical Discussion</a></li><li><a href=https://mau.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1696988/FULLTEXT02.pdf rel=noopener>Participation as a way for a Postcolonial Design of ICT4Ds</a></li><li><a href=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9096691 rel=noopener>Understanding the City Decision Making Process regarding Colonialism and Sociotechnical Imaginary on Smart Cities Initiatives</a></li></ul></li><li>Sociotechnical Imaginaries (tech only)<ul><li><a href=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1068/a140275p rel=noopener>Contradictory connectivity: spatial imaginaries and technomediated positionalities in Kenya’s outsourcing sector</a><ul><li>METHOD</li><li>Kenya has long been characterized by an embeddedness into the global capitalist system that is marked by unequal power relationships.</li><li>Using an initial exploratory coding phase, a coding scheme was developed to code themes and interpretive codes.

Respondents are offered a series of questions or a set of scenarios with which they can choose to agree or disagree, and they are asked to elaborate on their remarks in written responses that provide insights into challenges and opportunities of the digital future at the time of each study. T</li><li>Examples<ul><li>The Metaverse<ul><li><em><strong>The question:</strong> Considering what you know about the metaverse, which statement comes closer to your view about its likely evolution by 2040?</em>- <em>By 2040 the metaverse WILL or WILL NOT be a much-more-refined and truly fully-immersive, well-functioning aspect of daily life for a half billion or more people globally.</em></li><li>The follow-up quantitative research questions were: Please elaborate on your answer. Tell us how you imagine that this shift of many online activities into more-fully-immersive digital spaces and digital life is likely to take place. Regardless of how you see the timing of this, how might it change human society? What are the likely positives of this transition? What negatives may emerge? How might it change the daily lives of the connected? And how will this transition change the way we think about our world and ourselves? We are also interested in hearing your thoughts about the role blockchain and its applications might play in this evolution of online life by 2040.</li></ul></li><li>Hopes for Digital Life in 2035<ul><li>The <em>entirety</em> of this particular report is based upon these participants’ responses to the following prompt, which was the final question of several that were asked of this group:<ul><li>We invite you to imagine a better world online: What is one example of an aspect of digital life that you think could be different in 2035 than it is today? We invite you to create a vignette of something you would like to see taking place in a “new and improved” digital realm in 2035.
