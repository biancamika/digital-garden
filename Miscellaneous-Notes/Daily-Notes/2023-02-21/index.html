It&rsquo;s an immensely powerful book that offers counter-intuitive ideas on thinking about assault, sexual &ldquo;projects&rdquo;, sexual locations, and thinking of how sex figures into a good life.</li><li>The book is almost 400 pages long. Would you want to read the book for three days, or would you want to watch an hour-long video about it? Even if it&rsquo;s still quite long, I think the one hour you spend with this video will be worth it. :)</li></ul><p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYYWyEqJjlk" rel=noopener>Jennifer S. Hirsch and Shamus Khan | Sexual Citizens</a></strong></p><blockquote><p>Over five years, professors Jennifer Hirsch and Shamus Khan interviewed more than 150 Columbia and Barnard College undergrads about their sex lives. The research explored what students wanted out of sex, how troubling encounters unfolded and how layers of misunderstandings led to assault. This is the book to read to help lead conversations about sex. It reframes the dialogue and helps prepare young people for sexual relationships. Read it, share it. Empower the young folks in your life.</p></blockquote><ul><li>It&rsquo;s not about adjudication; it&rsquo;s about prevention</li><li>One of the strongest predictors for being assaulted in college was being assaulted in high school</li><li>One of the reasons why assaults happen: the silence and shame that exists around sex and sexuality<ul><li>People lose their voice when they find themselves in situations they don&rsquo;t want to be in&mldr;rights aren&rsquo;t talked about</li><li>This is why it&rsquo;s important to have parents who talk about sex&mldr;it allows their kids to trust them with related topics. Otherwise, their values will be formed by pornography and advertising</li></ul></li><li>Beds have meanings&mldr;they&rsquo;re laden</li><li>It&rsquo;s not just furniture that influences campus life, but also control over space &ndash; which is really important for explaining power imbalances.</li><li>Most girls are conditioned largely by society or their parents to see sex as an ==emotional currency==. Meanwhile, for most boys, it was the opposite; they were conditioned to see sex as a ==physical currency==.<ul><li>Hybridizing these perspectives would create a healthier viewpoint of sex in general</li></ul></li><li>&ldquo;You up?&rdquo; has a lot of meanings</li><li>Asking &ldquo;Was this consensual or not?&rdquo; is really fundamentally a question about ==adjudication==, that is, who can we hold responsible for what happened, and what would a reasonable person do within this kind of context.</li><li>Alternative viewpoint: seeing consent processes as things that were not just a negotiation between two people in a moment, but instead that had ==entire social worlds== that were brought in that moment<ul><li>E.G. friends helping each other interpret the aftermath of sex, hooking up friends with other friends</li><li>^ All these relationships influence the sexual experience</li></ul></li><li>What we say doesn&rsquo;t always align with what we think, especially in terms of consent<ul><li>People have consented sex without verbally saying anything, and people who verbally consent participate in sex that they don&rsquo;t desire</li></ul></li><li>Push away from the idea of sex as as a contract. Part of the idea of sexual citizenship is asking how you&rsquo;re treating the other person.<ul><li>Are you treating them like someone who said yes, or treating them like a human being who was forced to say yes?</li></ul></li><li>On people choosing to do sexual acts just to complete the encounter&mldr; these are failures of sexual citizenship<ul><li>Men: not asking what the person really wanted</li><li>Women: raised in such a way that they think this is how they should be acting sexually</li></ul></li><li>The heterosexual students have a clear script that they learn (from media) for how sex should go forward. Meanwhile, the LGBTQ students don&rsquo;t have this script. Findnigs: there were many queer students whose consent practices were actually exactly the way you would want consent to be like.<ul><li>On the one hand, queer consent practices seemed like they should be producing a lot of safety. But on the other hand, we know from our survey and from other surveys that their rates of assault are actually much higher.</li><li>Perhaps because there is already so much shame surrounding gender identity. The kind of fear about the character of queer communities often produced additional warned of vulnerabilities for young people.</li></ul></li><li>On the influence of alcohol: students don&rsquo;t just drink and then like mistakenly have sex. In fact, they do it on purpose &ndash; they drink in order to have sex.</li><li>Race: you can&rsquo;t look atthe moment of consent without understanding sort of the broader dynamics of campus social life</li><li>Vision: prevention of sexual assault. Mission: breaking the silence on sex. How? Comprehensive sexuality education that is not just a course that&rsquo;s taught in school, but instead a kind of ==national project== that everyone participates in.<ul><li>Analogy: driving. We don&rsquo;t just give people the keys (which is what sex education is like, heavily focused on the body). Instead, we tell them how to drive safely. We also create environments (i.e. roads) and policies to make driving safer.</li><li>Part of the prevention strategy is to ask ourselves like what would it look like to do sexuality education in the same way that we do driver&rsquo;s ed</li></ul></li><li>A strategy against adjucation: a restorative justice model. Part of the ways in which we should think about adressing assaults after they happen is in reaffirming people&rsquo;s sexual citizenship<ul><li>There is a normative commitment (not just carceral)</li></ul></li><li>Pornography has such a large influence on young people because we&rsquo;ve abdicated our responsibility to actually provide sexuality education in it.</li><li>Part of the idea here in in placing sex within a broader matrix of social relationships so in saying that like sex is a social behavior it&rsquo;s not a health behavior is that is to say that like there are lots of things that we can do in terms ofcreating the conditions of basic respectand recognition of other persons that have nothing to do with sex that could actually have big impacts on the ways in which people act sexually</li><li>Analytical tools (three main concepts):<ul><li>What is your sexual project?</li><li>How can we build sexual citizenship?</li><li>What are the power inequalities within space? (sexual geography)</li></ul></li><li>making that learning (about sex) about critical thinking and power&mldr; is part of providing them with the ==tools== that they need to ==navigate these social worlds== more safely</li></ul><a href=#reflection-about-sex><h5 id=reflection-about-sex><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Reflection about Sex</h5></a><blockquote><p>Without needing to go deep into your personal lives, what are your reflections about how these ideas might be relevant to your life? What is sex for you? What are your thoughts about hooking up? How do your friends talk about sex? What have you learned about sex? Where do you learn about sex?</p></blockquote><p>Listening to the <em>Sexual Citizens</em> discussion made me realize how lucky I am to have my current group of friends. My <em>barkada</em> has been together since senior high school, where we were all brought together through <em>Dungeons & Dragons</em> — a game that has kept us close-knit for so long. Because of this, we&rsquo;ve witnessed each other&rsquo;s development over the years (e.g. discovering gender and sexuality, getting into new relationships, exploring ways of expressing sexuality). I would consider my friends my main source of learning about sex.</p><p>One thing I learned from them is that intimacy can be platonic too. My friend group is mainly composed of guys (9 of them versus 4 girls), and they are so&mldr;affectionate, even if most of them are straight. They hug each other, tell each other &ldquo;I love you (man)&rdquo;, and give each other gifts (even if they can get <em>gago</em> at times; recently, one of my guy friends brought back condoms from Italy). Whenever the group has sleepovers, the guys aren&rsquo;t afraid to sleep close to each other. It&rsquo;s quite heartwarming to see. Even the girls in the group could experience this. For instance: people would often assume I was dating two of my guy best friends because of how intimate they would act towards me (e.g. hugs, leaning towards each other, holding hands); in reality, this was just their way of expressing affection. My friend group also engages in intimacy by sharing our pains together: problematic parents, financial struggles, suicide attempts, etc. Whenever one of us was going through something, the others would definitely show our support as soon as we could, dropping everything to be virtually/physically present with the person.</p><p>Another thing I learned from my friends is that I have the right to speak up for myself. The way I grew up conditioned me to become a people-pleaser, even if I wasn&rsquo;t comfortable/happy with the situation I was in. To counter this, my two best guy friends would constantly remind me of my right. They&rsquo;d tell me that I could say no anytime, which taught me to keep in touch with my feelings. One other way I learned to stand up for myself was when a sex scandal exploded in our high school, triggering tons of girls to come out with their own stories. At the time, the guys in the friend group had a tendency of making misogyntistic jokes, which left the girls feeling uncomfortable. The scandal motivated us girls to speak up about this with our guy friends. They listened well, validated our feelings, and apologized, which completely touched us. Even if my friend group isn&rsquo;t perfect, I am grateful to have a safe space where I can grow with them.</p><a href=#rethinking-infidelity><h4 id=rethinking-infidelity><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Rethinking (In)Fidelity</h4></a><p>What do we really mean by infidelity? Is infidelity the end of a relationship or the beginning of a new one? How do we rethink it? In this TED Talk by Esther Perel, she highlights new ways of understanding such a phenomenon.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpp1nlx2aPM" rel=noopener>Esther Perel: Rethinking infidelity&mldr;.a talk for anyone who ever loved</a></strong></p><ul><li>Questions<ul><li>Why do we cheat, and why do happy people cheat?</li><li>How do we see/define infidelity?</li><li>Why do we think that men cheat out of boredom and fear of intimacy but women cheat out of loneliness and hunger for intimacy?</li><li>Is an affair always the end of a relationship?</li></ul></li><li>Infidelity has a tenacity that marriage can only envy</li><li>How do we reconcile what is universally forbidden yet universally practiced?</li><li>Tribe history<ul><li>Men had a license to cheat, with practically little consequence</li><li>Supported by a host of biological and evolutionary theories that justified their need to roam</li></ul></li><li>Monogamy used to be one person for life. Today, monogamy is one person at a time.</li><li>Monogamy had nothing to do with love.<ul><li>men relied on women&rsquo;s fidelity in order to know whose children these are and who gets the cows when I die</li></ul></li><li>The definition of infidelity keeps on expanding.<ul><li>E.G. sexting, watching porn, staying secretly active on dating apps</li><li>Because there is no universally agreed-upon definition of what even constitutes an infidelity</li></ul></li><li>Definition of an affair through three key elements:<ul><li>a secretive relationship (core structure of an affair)</li><li>an emotional connection to one degree or another</li><li>a sexual alchemy</li></ul></li><li>Marcel Proust: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s our imagination that is responsible for love, not the other person&rdquo;</li><li>When marriage was an economic enterprise, infidelity threatened our economic security. But now that marriage is a romantic arrangement, infidelity threatens our ==emotional security.==</li><li>Ironically, we used to turn to adultery &ndash; that was the space where we sought pure love. But now that we seek love in marriage, adultery destroys it.</li><li>Three ways infidelity hurts different today:<ul><li>We have a romantic ideal in which we turn to one person to fulfill an endless list of needs (e.g. greatest lover, best friend, best parent, trusted confidant, etc.).<ul><li>This tell us we&rsquo;re chosen, indispensable, irreplaceable, etc. And infidelity tells us that we&rsquo;re not. It is the ultimate betrayal.</li></ul></li><li>In the past, infidelity has always been painful. Now, it is also traumatic because it threatens our ==sense of self==.<ul><li>Infidelity is a violation of trust, a crisis of identity</li><li>Affairs in the digital age: death by a thousand cuts</li></ul></li><li>We are relying on our partners fidelity in with a unique fervor, but we also have never been more inclined to stray.<ul><li>And not because we have new desires today, but because we live in an era where we feel that we are entitled to pursue our desires (i.e. &ldquo;I deserve to be happy&rdquo;)</li><li>If we used to divorce because we were unhappy, today we divorce because we could be happier. And if divorce carried all the shame, today choosing to stay when you can leave is the new shame</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>So if we can divorce, why do we still have affairs? Now the typical assumption is that if someone cheats, it&rsquo;s either there&rsquo;s something wrong in your relationship or wrong with you.<ul><li>But millions of people can&rsquo;t all be pathological. Logic: if you have everything you need at home, why go out? If you have a perfect marriage, why cheat?</li><li>But what if passion is a finite shelf life? What if there are things that even a good relationship can never provide?</li></ul></li><li>Most cheaters are not chronic philanders. They are people who are conflicted between their values and behavior.</li><li>Affairs are an act of betrayal, and they are also an expression of ==longing and loss==.<ul><li>At the heart of an affair, you will often find a longing and a yearning for an emotional connection, for novelty, for freedom, for autonomy, for sexual intensity, a wish to recapture lost parts of ourselves, or an attempt to bring back vitality in the face of loss and tragedy.</li><li>One word to describe affairs: they feel alive</li></ul></li><li>Affairs are way less about sex and a lot more about ==desire. ==<ul><li>Desire for attention, desire to feel special, desire to feel important</li><li>The very structure of an affair &ndash; the fact that you can never have your lover &ndash; keeps you wanting: that in itself is a desire machine.</li></ul></li><li>Affairs, when exposed, may make way for a whole new kind of truth.<ul><li>E.G. honest and open conversations, rekindled sexual desire</li></ul></li><li>So when affairs are exposed, what can couples do?<ul><li>We know from trauma that ==healing begins== when the perpetrator ==acknowledges their wrongdoing.==</li><li>It is essential to do things that bring back a sense of self-worth (through being surrounded by friends and keeping busy with activities).</li><li>But even more important is to curb the curiosity to mine for the sordid details. Instead switch to the investigative questions, the ones that mine ==the meaning and the motives.==<ul><li>E.G. &ldquo;What did this affair mean to you?&rdquo;; &ldquo;What were you able to express or experience there that you could no longer do with me?&rdquo; ETC.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Betrayal in a relationship comes in many forms. There are many ways that we betray our partner: with contempt, with neglect, with indifference, with violence. Sexual betrayal is only one way to hurt a partner.<ul><li>In other words, the victim of an affair is not always the victim of the marriage.</li></ul></li><li>Takeaway: look at affairs from a dual perspective. Hurt and betrayal on one side, growth and self-discovery on the other. What it did to you, and what it meant for me.</li></ul><a href=#integrating-ideas><h4 id=integrating-ideas><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Integrating Ideas</h4></a><p>Here are some key integrating ideas and reflection questions:</p><ul><li><strong>Sexual citizenship</strong> is not about being &ldquo;liberated&rdquo; but ==respecting people&rsquo;s rights to their sexual lives.== In the same way that citizenship affords you rights and responsibilities, being sexual citizens provides you with similar rights and responsibilities. People have sex for different reasons, and you have to think about what reasons you have for it.</li><li>Discussion on <strong>sex and sexuality</strong> is usually shrouded with a lot of <strong>shame and silence</strong>. What are things that we need to talk about? What are things that need to be discussed more? Masturbation? Non-marital sex? Hooking up? LGBTQ issues? Open relationships? Dating apps? Kinks? BDSM?</li><li>Often, we talk about <strong>sexual intimacy and long-term relationships</strong> together with each other. But what happens when these relationships break down because of issues of trust? As we&rsquo;ve seen, ==an infidelity challenges our sense of self, identity, and emotional security.== It&rsquo;s not so much the sex as it is the betrayal of trust&ndash;the realization that we were insufficient. But is an infidelity always the end of a relationship, or could it be the start of a new one?</li><li><strong>Intimacy can come in different forms</strong>. Not everything is about sex. Intimacy can come in friendship&ndash;in a sharing of life&rsquo;s hurts, pains, pleasures, and joys. How are you living out this intimacy?</li></ul><p>Below, please share about what <strong>ideas you want to talk more about</strong> and what <strong>insights were inspired in you</strong> after the videos you&rsquo;ve just watched.</p><a href=#answer><h5 id=answer><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Answer</h5></a><p><strong>Questions to take on:</strong></p><ul><li>shame and silence</li><li>intimacy can come in different forms</li></ul><p>Given that discussion on sex and sexuality is usually shrouded with shame and silence, one thing that I believe needs to be talked about more is <strong>asexuality</strong>. What most people don&rsquo;t know is that asexuality is an umbrella term, and it exists on a spectrum. This can lead to many misconceptions surrounding asexuality. For instance, asexuals aren&rsquo;t always sex-repulsed; there are also asexuals who are sex-neutral or sex-positive. And desiring libido or intimacy (whether romantic or platonic) does not disqualify one from asexuality. These misconceptions can lead to many people being confused about their sexuality; I am one such example.</p><p>It was in college when I realized that I may belong in the asexual spectrum. The feeling of sexual attraction was odd and unfamiliar to me (I never had celebrity or fictional crushes), so online dating and one-night stands — concepts heavily dependent on physical appearance — weirded me out. The only time I experienced this kind of attraction was when I was dating my best friend back in high school. So when I came across demisexuality, an orientation that requires close emotional connection for sexual attraction, it resonated a lot with me. However, it took me a long time to come to terms with this because of numerous doubts caused by misconceptions. Isn&rsquo;t this experience normal? Do I still qualify if I&rsquo;ve experienced masturbation and/or sex, and am still open it? How come I can&rsquo;t relate to other aces? I was only able to quell these doubts by researching a lot online, along with confiding with other friends (who were also going through similar struggles). These processes helped me because I realized I wasn&rsquo;t alone in my struggle; if sex and sexuality wasn&rsquo;t such a taboo topic, others like me would definitely get the help they&rsquo;d need.</p><p>Currently, I&rsquo;m choosing to stay single (even if I desire a romantic relationship, it&rsquo;s not something I&rsquo;m fully open to yet). While this can feel lonely at times (especially when most of your friends are happily taken), I&rsquo;ve been fulfilling my need for intimacy in other ways: warm hugs, deep conversations, and self-care. Having a more inclusive definition of intimacy has helped me acknowledge my emotions instead of repressing them (thanks to years of conditioning from being immersed in the conservative culture of Filipino families and Catholic schools). I wish others would be able to experience a similar level of emotional security.</p><p><img src=/images/Asexuality.png width=auto></p><a href=#podcast><h4 id=podcast><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Podcast</h4></a><blockquote><p>The podcast is a <strong>10–15-minute conversation with a person</strong> that the student chooses, trying to integrate the content of the discussion to the topic in class about relationships, social networks, and/or intimacy.

And just as intimacy can come in many forms (e.g. physical presence, emotional support), so can betrayals in relationships; you can commit infidelity not just sexually, but also emotionally. But fights can also serve as a form of communication, helping people in relationships align and grow together. However, it&rsquo;s important to not let anger take over during a fight; this is because it prevents people from discovering the meaning and motives behind their partner&rsquo;s actions, which is necessary for aligning in relationships.</p></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li>No backlinks found</li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://garden.bianca.digital/js/graph.abd4bc2af3869a96524d7d23b76152c7.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by Bianca Aguilar using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, © 2023</p><ul><li><a href=https://garden.bianca.digital/>Home</a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/biancamikaila>Twitter</a></li><li><a href=https://are.na/bianca-aguilar>Are.na</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
