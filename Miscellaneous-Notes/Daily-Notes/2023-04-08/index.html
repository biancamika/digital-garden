He said this with utmost respect and love for our countrymen. And given the weight of this article, it is the best time to shed light on possible issues that could come from our go-getter attitude (see: martyrdom) to prove ourselves worthy of the opportunities we have, despite these being exploitative and ==inhumane.==&rdquo;</li><li>Labor Export, OFWs<ul><li>Indeed, it is safe to say that ==the Philippines’ main export now is its people==&mldr;Many observers would easily agree with the observation that “no other phenomenon has paved the way for such deep and pervasive changes within the Philippine economic and social landscape”</li><li>Going on since the Spanish colonization<ul><li>Push factors: poverty and unemployment</li><li>Pull factors: labor needs and labor rights in other countries</li></ul></li><li>Effects<ul><li>Individual de-skilling and national “brain drain”<ul><li>OFWs’ educational and work attainments contrast sharply with the ==“elementary occupations”== in which they are employed, especially in their first jobs abroad. Doctors become nurses; teachers become domestic workers; college graduates become construction workers. As such, ==overseas work often results in de-skilling== (Pertierra, 1994). At the national level, concerns have been raised that the “invisible hand has not been able to solve” problems in the “supply of [skilled and technical] manpower” in the country (Gonzalez, 1992, p. 30). In other words, ==skills, knowledge and labour that could be utilised for the country’s development are going out of the country.==</li></ul></li><li>Questionable impacts on development<ul><li>Aside from debt payments, OFWs’ remittances are mostly spent meeting their families’ needs for food, education, and healthcare—in short, ==what a decent job and government services should provide citizens with.== This has fuelled an economy that is “consumption-driven”, with household consumption accounting for 70% of the GDP, and “service-oriented”, with the service sector contributing a majority share and employing many Filipinos (Batalla, 2018, pp. 217-220).</li><li>Half a century after the start of the labour export policy, the main reason for the migration of Filipinos—the lack of domestic employment opportunities—continues. The vast majority of OFWs cite gaining employment, changing jobs, or relocating for jobs as reasons for leaving the country (PSA & UPPI, 2019). The labour export policy traps Filipinos, and the Philippines economy as a whole, in ==underdevelopment and subservient neocolonialism.==</li></ul></li><li>Distorted education priorities<ul><li>Even before labour export, domestic education generally failed in ==“fostering or promoting engaged, participatory notions of citizenship that might lead to searching social or political critique”==, and thus expectations of the state are correspondingly “minimised”.</li><li>At the same time, global labour demands result in ==education being consciously reshaped to support out-migration== by ==producing skilled and semi-skilled labour== for overseas work.</li><li>In this context, progressives and nationalists describe Philippine education as ==“colonial,”== serving the interests of ==global powers== and other ==foreign countries and employers.==</li><li>Education also devalues local knowledge and raises students’ dissatisfaction with local conditions, while the provision of knowledge of outside communities and raised expectations in life to suggest the inescapability of migrating outside of the community—all anchored in “colonial roots, including the powerful symbols of democracy, education, and modernity implanted by the Americans” (Pertierra, 1994, pp. 61-63). Thus, ==“[s]tudents are systematically being prepared to participate in the global arena as highly-trained, English-speaking, cheap and docile labour force catering to the demands of the international market in line with the neoliberal project”== (del Rosario-Malonzo, 2007, p. 94).</li></ul></li><li>Aspects of culture<ul><li>Desire to support families</li><li>Deep religosity</li><li>^ The last two, in particular, are insidious. Filipinos are being trained into an attitude of finding a way or “pakikipagsapalaran (destiny-playing or adventure) and pagbabakasakali (chance-taking)” (Tadiar, 2004, p. 244) in a framework of subservience and inferiority. ==The education system teaches them that their country is in bad shape, that they are suited for jobs abroad, and that the only way to a better life for them and their country is to leave and be exploited by foreigners.== Socially, there are those who deal with the trauma of exploitation and suffering in narratives of triumph and self-sufficiency, glorifying their subservience and exploitation. In the long term, what does this do to the psyche of a country and a people?</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Takeaways: Decolonizing the Philippine Economy<ul><li>We can support measures and struggles upholding the various rights of OFWs, even as we recognise that these ==only address the symptoms== of the problem.</li><li>We can also support measures and struggles that seek to change the ==root causes of labour migration.==<ul><li>Since OFWs are everywhere, every call for improving migrants’ working and living conditions anywhere would most likely be to their benefit. The easiest step and bare minimum step is supporting calls for ==living and fair wages, minimum rest days, and non-discrimination,== among others.</li><li>Support migrant workers’ efforts to ==form organisations at the grassroots== level to lay claim to their rights, bearing in mind that in some contexts, even citizens are denied such freedoms. While the national migration survey states that a small minority of OFWs belong to organisations, there are efforts among OFWs in most migrant-receiving countries in this direction.</li><li>Supporting calls directed by OFWs to the Philippine government. These include creating decent jobs at home, providing immediate support, removing government exactions, and expanding the range of services provided by embassies and consulates.</li><li>Filipinos, talk to your friends and family. Ask yourself what working abroad does for your country and your people. What country do you want? How can you collectively change it?</li><li>==Demand that your government take responsibility.== Send this article to politicians. Tell them about the damage the labour export policy does to the nation and the people. Support calls for an end to the labour export policy in favour of increased domestic economic growth and job creation. We recognise that this is difficult to achieve. However, it is only by ==generating genuine agricultural and industrial development== to create decent jobs at home and provide for the basic needs of Filipinos that a significant solution can emerge.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li>The Miseducation of the Filipino<ul><li><a href=https://businessmirror.com.ph/2021/02/04/the-university-as-a-sanctuary-of-critical-thinking/ rel=noopener>Summary</a><ul><li>In brief, the thesis of Constantino is that ==the growth and progress of the country lie in an emancipatory educational system.== This is an educational system capable of graduating students possessing the knowledge and skills to decipher the problems and development challenges facing the country in various fields of human endeavor—social, scientific, economic, cultural, political and so on—and to find the answers to these problems and challenges. Honing these knowledge and skills requires the existence of educational institutions that are fully dedicated to the search for knowledge based on a critical understanding of ourselves, the world we live in and our place within it.</li><li>We need educational institutions that promote critical thinking, reflected in the free yet rigorous inquiry, discourse, debate and dialogue on the problems haunting the nation. For this to happen, educational institutions, especially those of higher learning, must be able to ==foster an environment of critical and scientific inquiry free from outside interference and censure==, as enunciated by Unesco and great universities worldwide. This is why University ==autonomy== and ==academic freedom== are essential in building this culture of critical thinking, which, in turn, is a key in advancing a nation’s progress in various fields of human endeavor.  Academic freedom is the DNA that fuels debates and discourses on academic ideas, theories and models that eventually ripen into answers and solutions to society’s problems.<ul><li>argument against Constantino</li></ul></li><li>the recent abrogation by the Department of National Defense of the 1989 UP-DND Accord (as well as the PUP-DND Accord), which defines the protocols governing police/military incursions on campuses, is a blow to academic freedom and the environment of critical inquiry.<ul><li>some officials of the country equate education to a narrow program of ==skills development, rote learning and even simple indoctrination.== Such educational policy framework is regressive. It is a threat to the development of critical thinking and has no place in the 21st century.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Problem: Miseducation of the Filipino; a.k.a. colonial education<ul><li>Context: American architects<ul><li>introduced by the Americans to aid with American conquest</li><li>&ldquo;The most effective means of subjugating a people is to capture their minds&mldr;the moulding of men&rsquo;s minds is the best means of conquest.

This is especially true in the Philippines, which relies on labor export in order to keep its economy afloat. Nonetheless, despite the demands of the globalized world, the Filipino children and youth should not only be sent to schools to be taught skills that would make them competent laborers for capitalist markets, but more importantly, ==they should be trained to become critical thinkers so as to be open, sensitive, and understanding of the beliefs and values of others as well as not to be enslaved by their respective belief and value systems.== In this light, this paper discusses how critical thinking can be taught more effectively in education institutions in the Philippines through reconsideration of the Taxonomy of Learning Objectives and a push for Critical Pedagogy. I will argue that the ==Taxonomy is reductive and lacking in terms of developing critical thinking in students, whereas, critical pedagogy brings the children and the youth to the table of dialogue by teaching them how to raise and accept questions without the attitude of hostility, the latter being a characteristic of an uncritical and enslaved mind.==</li></ul></li><li>Problem<ul><li>The Taxonomy of Educational Objectives and Its Detriments to Philippine Education<ul><li>Philippine education is by and large influenced by ==capitalist interests.== This means that students and graduates are geared toward ==replenishing the country’s labor force.== For this reason, the quality and objectives of education are focused on ==skills training.== Thus, educational objectives are formulated in relation to ==skills development==</li><li>dangers in viewing thinking skills as stringently hierarchical<ul><li>education may simply be reduced to skills training since skills-based jobs rarely require a level of thinking that goes beyond Bloom’s socalled “lower order”.</li><li>it may develop the misconception that there are people who are capable of higher order thinking and there are those who are not.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Proposed solution: <a href=/Cards/Critical-pedagogy rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Cards/Critical-pedagogy>Cards/Critical pedagogy</a> (a.k.a. develop a counter-consciousness)<ul><li>Methods<ul><li>Allowing avenues for dialogue<ul><li>the role of dialogue is to ==break the culture or theme of silence==, which is characteristic of oppression</li><li>it is the responsibility of teacher education institutions to produce educators that are not afraid to establish a dialogical relationship with their students in order to develop them to become critical thinkers.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Examples:<ul><li>Liberal arts universities like Ateneo</li><li>Educational Discussions? by NDMOs?</li></ul></li><li>Benefits<ul><li>critical thinking skills can benefit Filipino students in the globalized world by making them open-minded, sensitive, and understanding of the beliefs and values of others.</li><li>This is important because in a globalized world, individuals from different cultures and backgrounds interact with each other more frequently.

They are deemed modern-day heroes due to the impact of their overseas remittances. On a macro level, these help grow GDP, energizing the economy; on a micro level, these help ensure better lifestyles for their families. However, labor migration&rsquo;s positive effects are short term; left in their wake are long-term problems for the country’s development, including: individual de-skilling, national &ldquo;brain drain&rdquo;, encouragement of <em>endo</em> (contractualization), and scarcity of local jobs. Overall, the Philippines&rsquo; labour export policy traps its citizens and economy in underdevelopment and subservient neocolonialism (Marasigan, 2022).</p><p>Behind this trap is the Philippines’ colonial education, which is designed to serve the interests of global powers and other foreign countries/employers. Through the use of English as the medium of instruction, the influx of duty-free cheap American goods, and the transplantation of Western institutions/ideas, Filipinos were trained to become the perfect labor force for the international market. But we have also become aliens to ourselves, disconnected from our identities and each other; this lack of nationalism has crippled us in many ways, from preventing critical thinking to barring democratic leadership (Constantino, 2010; Marasigan, 2022). Therefore, unlocking the Philippines&rsquo; potential for growth and progress lies in an emancipatory educational system; here, students and teachers alike are not only able to acknowledge and question their current realities, but also able to work towards better futures, free of society&rsquo;s mental constraints.</p><p>This requires environments of critical inquiry
This isn&rsquo;t a new idea; for inspiration, we can take a look at the Renaissance and Reformation movements.</p><ul><li>the same country that lauds/upholds them is the one that condones their exploitation.</li></ul><p>Constantino (2010) believed that the country&rsquo;s potential for growth and progress lies in an emancipatory educational system. ==SENTENCE EXPOUNDING ON WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE FOR STUDENTS.== This isn&rsquo;t a new idea; for inspiration, we can take a look at the Renaissance and Reformation movements.</p><p>Similar to Constantino&rsquo;s vision, the humanists of the Renaissance saw education as a way to bring out human beings&rsquo; full potential. This was driven by a new spirit of inquiry into knowledge, which was brought about by dissatisfaction with intellectually surpressive institutions. Italian humanists aimed to live rich and full lives through the harmonious development of the mind, body, and morals, along with the encouragement of individual excellence and personal self-realization. In line with these objectives, the main skill emphasized by Italian humanists was appreciation of the world. Their main types of education — literary and esthetic — exposed students to the literary, visual, and performing arts; meanwhile, their curriculum highlighted three aspects of life: the life of the past, the world of emotions, and the world of nature (Wilds & Lottich, 1961, pp. 161-166). I believe this humanities-centered approach can be used to create a nationalistic education; this builds strong foundations (a.k.a. knowledge of local culture and history) that make people less prone to the influence of foreign media. However, this is not enough. To assure national survival, education must &ldquo;&mldr;produce a citizenry that [not only] appreciates and is conscious of its nationhood&mldr;[but also] has <em>national goals for the betterment of the community</em> [emphasis added]&mldr;not an anarchic mass of people who know how to take care of themselves only&rdquo; (Constantino, 2010, p. 15). Italian humanist education fails to fulfill the latter objective due to its individualistic and aristocratic nature; it has self-centered aims, and is only available to a privileged few. Northern humanists fill this gap by aiming at a rich and full life for society as a whole; they thought that achieving a meaningful life required social and moral reform. This can be seen in their emphasis of religious, moral, and social education, much of which was grounded on classical and Biblical texts. They also worked to provide democratic education, believing that rich and full lives should be possible for the masses too (Wilds & Lottich, 1961, pp. 169-170).</p><p>Naturally, the Northern humanists&rsquo; zeal for social reform led to criticism of the church, which then propelled the Reformation era. After unjust societal systems were brought to light (e.g. oppressive political and economic conditions; religious and eccleiastical evils), the masses learned to question religion and other aspects of life; this gave them the freedom and power to decide their own fate, freeing them from being dependent on an educated upper class (Wilds & Lottich, 1961, pp. 178-179; National Geographic, 2017). We can trace this paradigm shift to one of the Reformers&rsquo; principles: Scripture Alone (<em>sola Scriptura</em>). It demanded that every person must be able to read and understand the Scripture on their own — which discouraged reliance on the church and clergy. This also entailed a need for every person to develop literacy and critical thinking, calling for a reformation of education. Reformers like Luther advocated for this by promoting human-centered ideas, such as universal education, along with broad and rich curriculums. These were based on humanist teaching principles: holistic development, inclusivity (shown by use of the vernacular), Academic Freedom. Luther believed that education must teach students how to contribute to society (<em>liberalis</em> study) instead of skills that simply keep them in servitude (<em>servilus</em> education) (Criss, 2017). To summarize, humanists and reformists alike would be against the Philippines&rsquo; colonial education due to its dehumanizing nature. By keeping the country subservient to global powers and other foreign countries/employers, it prevents Filipinos from living rich and full lives.</p><p>The influence of these past eras can still be seen in Philippine education. Humanists would be delighted to see the liberal arts education offered by most of our top universities. But they would be saddened to see that the humanities is currently fighting for its place in curricula: Philippine history was removed in high school, Filipino/Panitikan are no longer mandated subjects in college, and general education subjects were proposed to be removed from the tertiary level (Ignacio, 2019; Rey, 2019; Cahiles-Magkilat, 2022). Exacerbating this issue is a prevalent culture of anti-intellectualism, where most Filipinos tend to see high intelligence as a negative trait. This is rooted in longstanding colonialism and classism; it&rsquo;s difficult for the (typically uneducated and poor) masses to empathize with the intelligent, especially when these people often become their oppressors (Madrazo-Sta. Romana, 2015). Meanwhile, similar to the Reformation, Philippines education is being utilized as a weapon of indoctrination. But instead of the church, I&rsquo;d&rsquo; argue that it&rsquo;s the state waging war. They want to teach Filipinos <em>what</em> to think, not <em>how</em> to think. Aside from the removal of the humanities, this is also exhibited by the reintroduction of mandatory ROTC and the authorization of police/military to enter campuses; these examples display officials&rsquo; limited conception of education as &ldquo;&mldr;a narrow program of skills development, rote learning and even simple indoctrination&rdquo; (Ofreneo, 2021).
But we must remind ourselves that even the state is just a puppet — it&rsquo;s the international powers that are pulling the strings. How can we claim we&rsquo;re independent when our schools still nurture colonial mindsets? Because of these minds, we remain enslaved laborers.</p><p>The main insight I drew from this process is that Filipinos are deeply embedded in intersecting systems of oppression, particularly capitalism and colonization, which leads to all the various ways we experience domination (Collins, 2000). Thus, solutions that do not acknowledge these underlying systems are likely to be ineffective in the long-term; for instance, measures upholding OFW rights is not enough to stop brain drain. Related to this, reviewing history is helpful for becoming a systems thinker. As a designer, I want to ensure that the solutions I come up with aim to not just treat surface symptoms, but also tackle root causes. However, I admit that this process makes me feel helpless too; seeing how deep and pervasive problems can get makes me wonder if there is actually anything impactful that I can do, especially when it comes to macro forces like the economy.</p><ul><li>End: Martin Luther King on labor and dignity? &ldquo;No work is significant.
