It is high time we realized that it is pointless to praise the light and preach it if nobody can see it. It is much more needful to teach people ==the art of seeing.”==<ul><li>from Jung, C. G. (1968). <em>Psychology and alchemy</em> (H. Read, M. Fordham, G. Adler, & W. McGuire, Eds., R. F. C. Hull, Trans.). Princeton University Press. (Original work published 1944)<ul><li>understanding of visioning—the “art of seeing”—as his pathway to individuation and inner rebirth.</li><li>Jung would again chastise modern man’s inability to establish the necessary, living connection between outer images and the depths of inner life. Psychology, he claimed, “is concerned with the act of seeing.” More to the point, in a world where the blind are leading the blind, it befalls psychology “to teach people the <em>art</em> of seeing”</li><li>What really matters in Jung’s recollections are not the details he reminisces about per se, but rather what he has to say about the ==inner process== as it begins to occur and as it unfolds; in this case not only did he notice what was intervening beyond the horizon of consciousness, but as he became aware of it, he also made room for more to arise. ==Consciousness was, as it were, instantly put in the service of the unconscious==; the outer eye made to provide for the inner eye, so that “the equivalent images … lying dormant in [his] own unconscious” (Jung, 
<a href=https://www.tandfonline.com.oca.rizal.library.remotexs.co/doi/full/10.1080/00332925.2022.2082794# rel=noopener>Citation1944/1968</a>, para. 14) could awaken and find their way out. It is through the ==joint operation of outer and inner vision== that the art of seeing that is so central to Jung’s psychology becomes woven—like a gossamer thin fabric at the seamless junctures of multiple levels of reality.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li>My position (overall stance that the writer of an essay takes in answering the question or on the issue/topic at hand):<ul><li>topic: defining modernism</li><li>my stance on it: we need to be aware of this screen. we can&rsquo;t destroy it, but we can accept it? instead of seeing this screen as a clouded window, we can see it as a mirror</li></ul></li><li>Difference between windows and screens:<ul><li>Windows are transparent, while screens are opaque</li><li>As a noun: a window is an opening that allows the external world inside, while a screen acts as a physical divider.

To transition?</li></ol></li></ol></li><li>Windows versus Screens<ol><li>The modern condition acts as a screen; unlike windows, which show us the external world, screens reflect our internal world.<ol><li>I believe that there is so much more meaning hidden underneath this statement.</li></ol></li><li>To uncover this, I want to dissect the function of windows and screens by analyzing them as forms of media. Both of these objects stand in between spaces (e.g. outdoors-indoors; physical-digital), which enables them to <em>mediate</em> the viewing experience between them. Thus, our views are dictated by windows and screens.<ol><li>One may assume that the transparency of windows allows only truthful perspectives, while the opaqueness of screens enables the imagination to go wild.</li><li>But are they really as different as we think? This is something I&rsquo;d like to counter.</li></ol></li><li>Windows<ol><li>While windows provide clear views of what is outside, they can also conceal us from what is on the other side.</li><li>The main reason is their function as a barrier, physically separating us from the other side.</li><li>This produces an effect of paranormic perception, wherein we disassociate ourselves from the objects we watch because they belong to a different space.</li><li>And just as the window separates humans from objects, gazing from behind a window separates us from the people we see.<ol><li>This division provides a kind of invisibility, explaining why people-watching is such an appealing activity. Perceiving strangers face-to-face is uncomfortable; having a safe space to watch from (like a building or car) removes this tension, which frees us to observe and judge other people.</li><li>However, this invisibility inherently clouds our perspective; the people we see outside are reduced to our perceptions of them.<ol><li>What windows represent: &ldquo;That is how we see the world: we see it existing outside ourselves, and yet we have only a mental representation of it inside ourselves.</li></ol></li></ol></li><li>And in line with this, we are reminded of how windows frame our views.<ol><li>This goes both ways. Take for example a building. Those inside it get a fixed view of the world outside, while those outside it get a fixed view of the building&rsquo;s interior.</li><li>We can apply this to our internal perception and external presentation. The world as we see it will always be defined by our psyche; meanwhile, the way we are seen in the world will always be defined by social identifiers.</li></ol></li><li>Thus, I&rsquo;d argue that windows are actually screens.<ol><li>Despite promising authenticity through transparency, the incomplete views they provide inherently create their own reality.</li><li>This is the modern perspective.</li></ol></li></ol></li><li>Screens<ol><li>As exemplified by windows, the screen as a medium is seemingly neutral, yet apparently biased. It affects the viewer through manipluation, which manifests in many ways:</li><li>First, screens manipluate <strong>bodies.</strong><ol><li>Screens serve as safeguards. They can do this by acting as dividers, buffers, and protectors.</li><li>However, this form of protection can also become a means of enclosure.<ol><li>The same walls used to shield people from the elements can also be used to detain them.</li><li>Similarily, our psyches can act as prisons. They could lead us to withdraw into ourselves, closing us off from the people around us.</li></ol></li></ol></li><li>Second, screens manipluate <strong>information.</strong><ol><li>Screens function as filters, simultaenously transmitting and translating the information it intercepts.</li><li>This inherently involves exclusion, for interpretation is impossible without this. When information is processed to be comprehendible, there will always be meaning lost in translation. Thus, the screen becomes as a censor.</li><li>This kind of censorship can be seen in the mass society&rsquo;s approach to knowledge. Due to its rational viewpoint, collective and scientific knowledge is valued more than self-knowledge.<ol><li>Add more examples from Jung chapter 1</li></ol></li></ol></li><li>Third, screens manipluate <strong>images.</strong><ol><li>Screens serve as both displays and masks. Take for example Plato&rsquo;s Allegory of the Cave. Acting as a screen, the cave wall presents shadows to the prisoners while also concealing the objects these shadows come from. What this shows us is that both neutrality and bias can be found in a screen&rsquo;s projection.</li><li>This paradox is also exemplified by psychological dualism — the human person&rsquo;s capacity for good and evil. Our split condition can fragment our image of reality, dividing it into worlds of light and darkness. If we fail to acknowledge our divided nature, we could end up projecting evil onto others, for this is easier to do compared to recognizing evil in ourselves.</li></ol></li><li>Finally, screens manipluate <strong>memory.</strong><ol><li>At first, screens are seen as reflective surfaces, displaying only what is in front of it. But mass media like television, films, and websites show how screens can also act as storage. So what if screens could store experience? Just as screens censor information, experiences conveyed by screens would become inherently warped.</li><li>This is best shown by Sigmund Freud&rsquo;s concept of the screen memory: a seemingly trivial childhood memory that is used to cover an associated significant memory. People unwittingly use screen memories to protect themselves from repressed traumas or desires.</li><li>Here, we can see how the psyche screens our experiences to leave us with acceptable memories; these screen memories then enable us to maintain the fiction of a stable identity.</li></ol></li></ol></li></ol></li><li>Reflection<ol><li>What we can take away from the analogy of windows and screens is that all we see through the lens of modernism is our shadowy internal life. This life can affect our external world by alienating us from others, restricting our learning, tainting our perceptions, and repressing our memories. Despite the darkness it holds, our psyche only becomes truly detrimental to us when is ignored; by acknowledging its influence, we can learn to live with it.</li><li>The key to this lies in self-knowledge, which we can acquire through exploring our unconscious. Contrary to common belief, our shadow self need not be an enemy; if we address this self (a.k.a. shadow work), we would gain psychological insights that we could then integrate into our personality.</li><li>I myself can vouch for the benefits of this process.<ol><li>Growing up in a psychologically and financially difficult family situation has deeply scarred me.</li><li>I believed this &ldquo;marked&rdquo; me for life, deeming me an outcast in a culture driven by close ties. For me, it explained why it was so hard to connect with most people; only those who experienced similar circumstances could bear getting close to me.</li><li>I became a workaholic, pursuing success in hopes of covering this &ldquo;mark&rdquo;, but this trauma continued to bleed into my life; this would end up causing harm to myself and my loved ones.</li><li>Setting aside the time to process my experiences (through conversations with friends, therapists, and myself) enabled me to reframe my mindset. My trauma may have clouded my perpsective of reality, but I believe it has also enrichened it, for it gives me a deeper understanding of human nature. In the past, I assumed the worst in people; now, I understand that everyone comes from a place of pain, and those who hurt others simply haven&rsquo;t addressed their own pains. I wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to adopt this viewpoint if I haven&rsquo;t gone through my own suffering.</li></ol></li><li>Thus, I call everyone to embrace this way of seeing. Reality as we know it may not exist, but modernism shows us that we have the power to create our own reality. So will you choose to stay blind, or keep your eyes open?</li></ol></li></ol><ul><li>in the age of mass communication, windows give us flat images</li><li>windows are static, while screens are always changing</li><li>screens and willpower<ul><li>we can chooose what to see</li></ul></li><li>acts as a filter&mldr;an inherently biased function.
