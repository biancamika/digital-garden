Therefore, it&rsquo;s often helpful to know what you are looking for. In this course, we will review the following features in each of the eras that we will investigate:</p><ul><li><strong>üéØ AIM:</strong> pertains to the underlying ==purpose, philosophy or ideology== of education. <em>What is the purpose of education? What was education for?</em></li><li><strong>üè´ TYPE:</strong> refers to the ==various forms== in which education appears within a ==given society or culture== (e.g., moral instruction, vocational training, physical education, military or civic training). <em>What were the formal and/or informal types of education present?</em></li><li><strong>üìñ CONTENT:</strong> emphasizes the ==selection of traditions, experiences, learnings, skills, crafts, or group activities thought to be valuable within a culture== and made the basis for formal or informal education. <em>What was included/excluded in the the types of education?</em></li><li><strong>üë®‚Äçüè´üë™ AGENCY:</strong> pertains to the ==specific influence== of the clan, the tribe or nation, the home (including parental instruction), the church or other religious orientation, apprenticeship, the formal school, or the society itself. <em>Who were the &ldquo;influencers&rdquo; of education in that time?</em></li><li><strong>üéì ORGANIZATION:</strong> refers to the ==various gradations, and age levels== within the educational system. <em>How was education organized?</em></li><li><strong>üôãMETHOD:</strong> includes the ==devices, procedures, or direction== of the formal school as well as the more ==informal influences of society, culture, or politics.== <em>How did education happen?</em></li></ul><a href=#education-in-ancient-china><h3 id=education-in-ancient-china><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Education in Ancient China</h3></a><a href=#geography-matters><h4 id=geography-matters><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Geography Matters</h4></a><a href=#geography-as-context><h5 id=geography-as-context><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Geography as Context</h5></a><ul><li>One way to understand an educational system is to investigate the <strong>context</strong> that brought about its development.

Therefore, one of the best ways to understand Ancient Chinese Education is to understand where Confucius is coming from.</li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFt_VGG0kJU" rel=noopener>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFt_VGG0kJU</a><ul><li>In a warring world, Confucius exemplified benevolence and integrity.</li><li>Because of his difficult circumstances (i.e. father dying early, having to support disabled family), Confucius developed a lifelong sympathy for the suffering of the common people.</li><li>Confucius was inspired by ancient relics, even if they were considered by many as irrelevant.</li><li>He came to believe that human character is formed in the family and by education in ritual, literature, and history. A person cultivated in this way works to help others, guiding them by moral inspiration rather than brute force.</li><li>He struggled to find a ruler who aligned with his morals. In accordance with his philosophy, and contrary to the practice of the time, Confucius dissuaded rulers from relying on harsh punishments and military power to govern their lands. This is because he believed that a good leader inspires others to spontaneously follow him by virtue of his ethical charisma.</li><li>Confucius also believed that because the love and respect we learn in the family are fundamental to all other virtues, personal duties to family sometimes supersede obligations to the state.</li><li>Despite the struggles he went through, he believed that heaven had a plan for the world, and that a person could always find joy in learning and music.</li><li>&ldquo;Do not inflict upon others that which you yourself would not want.&rdquo;</li></ul></li><li><strong>üéØ AIM: What was the Aim of Ancient Chinese Education?</strong><ul><li>Education in Ancient China was aimed to preserve and perpetuate ==traditional beliefs, customs and way of life.== The Chinese believed that education was an instrument to secure ==social stability== by &ldquo;preserving the past&rdquo;. Hence, ideals and beliefs were the same from generation to generation. Life was crystallized in fixed forms.</li><li>Another important educational aim in ancient China was to prepare its citizen for the
<a href=https://www.ancient.eu/article/1335/the-civil-service-examinations-of-imperial-china/ rel=noopener>civil examination</a>. Being successful in these examinations provided opportunities for positions in government as well as achieving a higher status in life.</li></ul></li><li><strong>üè´ TYPE: What was the type of education?</strong><ul><li>To support these educational aims, ==moral training== was given emphasis. Moral training did not refer to right or wrong (as we know it now) but rather to the idea of of noble living.</li><li>Noble living meant valuing the
<a href=https://prezi.com/33o0lrhkpeow/the-five-relationships/ rel=noopener>five relationships</a> and following the
<a href=http://www.goolevalve.com/news/news-detail-195.html rel=noopener>five cardinal virtues</a>. Vocational and domestic training were also highly valued.

Limit your answers to two to three sentences for each question.</p><ol><li>What is the Chinese concept of learning?</li><li>What factors affected educational opportunities in China?</li></ol></blockquote><ol><li>The Chinese equated the act of learning to memorization. This is because the morals they aspired to develop in their educational system were merely seen as a matter of knowledge; after all, truth is what has simply been agreed on in the past, and virtue was an observance of those fixed ideas and customs. This perception is reflected in exceedingly formalized education and reliance on classical readings.</li><li>Some factors that affected educational opportunities in China were gender and socioeconomic class. Private schools and public examinations were only open to males, but preparation for these examinations required much leisure time that only those of higher classes could afford to spend.</li></ol><a href=#ancient-chinese-education-today><h5 id=ancient-chinese-education-today><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Ancient Chinese Education Today</h5></a><ul><li>Now that you have a better grasp of what Ancient Chinese Education may have been like, let&rsquo;s make some connections to present day practice.</li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSVMzBFRhsQ" rel=noopener>Education for children on Chinese traditional culture</a><ul><li>The video above shows how ancient educational practices are still given premium in contemporary education in China.¬†¬†<em>If we look beyond China, do we also see a semblance of such practices?
