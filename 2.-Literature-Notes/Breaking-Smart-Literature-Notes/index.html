Permanent Notes/Waldenponding</a> is a philosophy of relating to technology based on Thoreau&rsquo;s Walden Pond experiment. It&rsquo;s basically all about unplugging and retreating from technology.</li></ul><blockquote><p>==philosophy of relating to technology== I call Waldenponding (after ==Thoreau&rsquo;s Walden Pond experiment== on which Walden is based). The crude caricature is &ldquo;smash your smart phone and go live in a log cabin to reclaim your attention and your life from being hacked by evil social media platforms.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><ul><li>It is driven by FOBO: <a href=/3.-Permanent-Notes/Fear-of-Being-Ordinary rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/3.-Permanent-Notes/Fear-of-Being-Ordinary>3. Permanent Notes/Fear of Being Ordinary</a> and ego-attachment.<ul><li>FOBO is the opposite of FOMO: Fear of Missing Out. This is exploited by third parties who aim to drown you in information.</li></ul></li></ul><blockquote><p>If FOMO, Fear Of Missing Out, is the basic fear exploited by third parties that want to drown you in information, the basic fear exploited by people telling you to unplug and retreat is ==FOBO: Fear Of Being Ordinary.==</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Waldenponding, I strongly suspect, is ==driven more by FOBO and ego-attachment== than by any real fear of having your mind, productive potential, and rewards destroyed by &ldquo;hacked attention.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><ul><li>Retreating from information flows is just ==a different way of having your attention hacked by others.==

There is valuable info at all levels from twitter gossip to philosophy books. You should stay plugged in.</p></blockquote><ul><li>If you don&rsquo;t stay informed, you&rsquo;ll end up with the lowest-level job in the social computer: ==process low-latency information with small-minded cognition.==<ul><li>A.k.a. low-level bug reporting/testing</li><li>E.G.
<a href=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-13/facebook-paid-hundreds-of-contractors-to-transcribe-users-audio rel=noopener>transcribing user audio</a></li><li>Need to upskill basically</li></ul></li></ul><blockquote><p>If you don&rsquo;t manage your information economy career, you will default to the lowest-level job in the social computer: ==processing very low-latency information with small-minded cognition (bottom left) for small bets.== It&rsquo;s the equivalent of low-level bug reporting/testing.</p></blockquote><ul><li>You can manage your attention by:<ul><li>==being aware== of your current mind size (small to great)</li><li>==consciously targeting== the zone you want to be in.</li></ul></li></ul><blockquote><p>The way to manage your attention is to ==be sensitive to your current mind size (small to great)== and ==consciously target the zone you want to be in,== moving fluidly between small/great mind.</p></blockquote><ul><li>Failure: an information diet that doesn&rsquo;t enable you to translate your information consumption/production choices into winning bets<ul><li>Summary of ==three ways to fail:==<ul><li>trying to be Great Minded all the time</li><li>trying to be Great Minded with a mostly low-latency information diet</li><li>trying to consume a high-latency information diet without aspiring to create more than small-minded thoughts</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><blockquote><p>There are ==THREE ways to fail== at this: a) Thinking you can be Great Minded all the time. b) Trying to be Great Minded purely on a low-latency information diet (upper-left red box) c) Trying to consume a high-latency information diet without aspiring to more than small-minded thoughts (lower-right red box)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Each failure mode is an information diet that leads to patterns of betting that fail to deliver a positive return long-term. It&rsquo;s not addictive FOMOing that kills you, but not being able to translate the information consumption/production choices you&rsquo;re making into winning bets.</p></blockquote><ul><li>1st failure mode: trying to consume only information at your target level<ul><li>Information diet input is ==needed from all levels to work at any level==</li><li>E.G. trying to &ldquo;float&rdquo; atention at a focused point</li><li>the danger in this is that ==your mind-level might choose you==, instead of the other way around</li></ul></li></ul><blockquote><p>The first failure mode manifests as trying to consume only information at your target level. This will fail. ==You need some information diet input from ALL levels to work at ANY level==</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>==Trying to &ldquo;float&rdquo; your attention at a focused point on the turnpike== rather than distributing attention all along it is the other way to ==fail==</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The danger in executing this turnpike roadmap strategy is that ==your mind-level might choose you rather than you choosing your mind-level.==</p></blockquote><ul><li>2nd failure mode: trying to output ==Great Thoughts== with only ==low-latency live information==</li></ul><blockquote><p>The second failure mode manifests as ==trying to have Great Thoughts on a diet of pure low-latency live information== (upper-left red box).</p></blockquote><ul><li>3rd failure mode: keeping up with all information at all latencies with a ==small-minded level==<ul><li>The more latency there is, the bigger mind you need</li></ul></li></ul><blockquote><p>The final failure mode is trying to ==keep up with all the information at all latencies at a small-minded level== (lower-right red box).</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Higher latency requires ==higher abstraction levels/bigger minds== to extract value.</p></blockquote><ul><li>Training attention is like ==weight training.==<ul><li>You need to increase your load slowly (e.g. 10s -> 10min), and maybe train to exhaustion.<ul><li>Small mind and can only read/make tweets? Try an essay</li><li>Great mind and can only process philosophy books? Try Twitter for 15min<ul><li>like low-weights/high-volume endurance training</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><blockquote><p>This is a bit like ==weight training.== You have to increase the weights slowly and perhaps ==train your attention to exhaustion== a bit. If you&rsquo;re in small mind zone and can only consume/produce tweets, try an essay. See how far you get. Strength-train attention from 10s to 10min. You can and should go the other way as well. If you can only read big philosophy books by dead people and processing the chaotic churn of a Toxic Day on Twitter is too much for you, try handling it for 15 minutes, then an hour. Try posting instead of just reading. This is like ==low-weights/high-volume endurance training.== Harder than it looks.</p></blockquote><ul><li>The ==load== you&rsquo;re training against: ==attention-hacking designs.==</li><li>But the atrophying of attention and latency limits will always happen due to the ==information firehose,== a.k.a. the result of free/cheap information distribution in our digital world</li></ul><blockquote><p>this ==atrophying of attention and latency limits== will happen REGARDLESS of whether evil designers are trying to hack your attention and keep you phase-locked into their preferred 10s latency information loop. ==Their designs are in fact the LOAD you&rsquo;re training against==</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>information distribution has become free/cheap, so the firehose is going to have flows at all timescales, time constants, and abstraction levels no matter what designers and advertisers want or don&rsquo;t want. ==It&rsquo;s the information firehose itself that&rsquo;s creating this environment not evil designers.==</p></blockquote><ul><li>Back in a pre-digital world, attention was originally hacked by powerful religious leaders who&rsquo;d tell people to unplug from information flows, giving them power as a result.<ul><li>Also based on <a href=/3.-Permanent-Notes/Fear-of-Being-Ordinary rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/3.-Permanent-Notes/Fear-of-Being-Ordinary>3. Permanent Notes/Fear of Being Ordinary</a></li></ul></li></ul><blockquote><p>==the original attention hack: powerful religious leaders== telling smart people to check out and unplug from information flows. That way, they get the power</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>This game is based on the opposite fear to FOMO which I call FOBO. If FOMO is Fear of Missing Out, FOBO is Fear Of Being Ordinary.</p></blockquote><ul><li>In the GSCITC, we are simply a ==unique instance== of a computerized human intelligence.<ul><li>However, the GSCITC cannot give you ==individual recognition.==</li><li>This flattens our egos and identities.</li><li>This is the heart of <a href=/3.-Permanent-Notes/Fear-of-Being-Ordinary rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/3.-Permanent-Notes/Fear-of-Being-Ordinary>3. Permanent Notes/Fear of Being Ordinary</a>. We just don&rsquo;t want to be another component of the GSCTIC; our efforts aren&rsquo;t recognized even if they contribute to the system</li></ul></li></ul><blockquote><p>When you are plugged into the GSCITC, ==you are part of a great computational fluidization of human cognition.== You&rsquo;re just ==one instance== in a liquid cloud of human intelligence, your thoughts entangled with those of others in a giant ongoing computation.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>This fluidization is a different eme rgent social phenomenon from the homogenization achieved by Organization Man corporations. ==Instead of being a faceless interchangeable part, you are a unique entangled particle in a quantum soup.==</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The cost though is that even if your contributions are unique and your personal payoff makes it worthwhile if you do it right, ==the one thing the liquid cloud can&rsquo;t offer you is individual recognition.==</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The GSCITC is not a homogenizer of effort or imagination, but ==it IS a homogenizer of egos and identities. ==What you do counts. Who you are doesn&rsquo;t. You are an ordinary part of an extraordinary process.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>This is the heart of FOBO. Fear of Being Ordinary. ==Fear of being just another entangled particle in the GSCITC.== Fear of your ego dissolving into the collective ego. Fear of having &ldquo;nothing to show&rdquo; for playing a part, despite it being sustainable.</p></blockquote><ul><li>A real adept should be able to:<ul><li>1.) turn even the most toxic Twitter stream into ==actionable insight==</li><li>2.) have ==strength-trained attention,== so that they can consume whatever they want</li></ul></li></ul><blockquote><p>A real adept oughta be able to meditate on the angriest, most toxic twitter stream, consume the bile, and turn it into nectar: ==actionable insight you can bet on in the real world.==</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>==A real adept ought to have strength-trained attention== so they can spend an hour either reading a tweetstream or a once-in-a-generation history-disrupting philosophy book.</p></blockquote><ul><li>Overall, the GSCITC is the ==only mechanism enabling us to tackle world problems== (that industrial age mechanisms couldn&rsquo;t cope with). So we need to do our best in it by staying connected.</li></ul><blockquote><p>We are all now part of a powerful global social computer in the cloud that is possibly ==the only mechanism we have available to tackle the big problems of the world that industrial age mechanisms are failing to cope with.== We might as well get good at it. Do your part. Stay as plugged in as you can.</p></blockquote><a href=#against-waldenponding-2><h3 id=against-waldenponding-2><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Against Waldenponding 2</h3></a><ul><li>Horcrux allegory (don&rsquo;t trust a tangible soul) vital to our relationship with digital devices.

If you&rsquo;re letting your attention get &ldquo;hacked&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re choosing to. ==If you think the only kind of agency you have is the agency to uncritically withdraw to save your soul, you&rsquo;ve been pwned, but it isn&rsquo;t by the tech platforms.==</p></blockquote><ul><li>Waldenponding is the ==demonization of digital devices.==<ul><li>But devices are actually more like magic tricks; they&rsquo;re designed by humans to misdirect your attention.</li><li>Manipulate you into creating Walden ponds</li></ul></li></ul><blockquote><p>==Waldenponding = primitivist, fetishistic fear of screens as demonic objects.== A way of relating to digital devices that seems shaped by a fearmongering vision of them as soul-sucking pumps, and their designers as Dark Lords who are far too powerful for you, mere mortal, to actively resist. Your only reliable weapon, they say, is the off switch.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>==demonization of digital devices== &ndash; perfectly ordinary objects governed by the laws of physics and designed by mere humans &ndash; is something like a magic trick, where the magician wants to misdirect your attention. While you&rsquo;re busy worrying about the evil rectangles of light stealing your soul, you are missing the real danger: the horcruxes they are tempting you to create and trust with legibilized, dead bits of your soul.</p></blockquote><ul><li>Waldenponding is a search for meaning similar to ==idolization.== The idol here can be anything that&rsquo;s not a digital device.<ul><li>E.G. paper book, session of manual labor, hike in the woods</li><li>They act as tangible focal points which the quests (for meaning) ==revolve around,== preventing one from going too far.</li><li>This is what makes Waldenponding dangerous, and it&rsquo;s worse because it&rsquo;s ==seen as a way to do the opposite== (idolization)</li></ul></li></ul><blockquote><p>Waldenponding is a search for meaning that is ==circumscribed by the what you might call the spiritual gravity field of an object or behavior held up as ineffably sacred.== The associated literal pattern of religiosity is idolatry. Today, the ==&ldquo;idol&rdquo;== in question is generally characterized by negative definition as ==&ldquo;almost anything other than the profane digital device screen."== It can take a variety of forms: the in-person conversation, the board game, the hike in the woods, the session of manual labor, the construction project, the family dinner, the paper book. All are excellent things, to be valued for what they literally are. But as suggested repositories for bits of your soul, they are incredibly dangerous.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>the loci at the hearts of the narratives are more than mere motifs or synecdoches for larger spiritual quests. They serve as ==physically embodied focal points around which the quests themselves revolve,== like strange attractors. Though the protagonists may, through the narrative, explore the universe in much more expansive ways, you can see where they keep bits of their souls locked down; the zone that keeps drawing them back; the idol that prevents them from wandering too far.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Each in its natural form is a perfectly fine thing. ==It is only when transformed into sacralized fragments of &ldquo;soul&rdquo; that they turn into dangerous Dark Magic objects. Waldenponding is dangerous because it encourages you to do exactly that.== The effect is particularly insidious because it is presented as a way to do the opposite.</p></blockquote><ul><li>How to tell if it&rsquo;s a horcrux:<ul><li>1.) Do you know where it keeps its brain?<ul><li>For devices: brain = intelligence</li></ul></li><li>2.) Does it seem to embody a &ldquo;soul&rdquo; tangibly?<ul><li>For device: legible piece of soul?</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><blockquote><p>Horcrux tests: ==do you know where it keeps its brain?== And ==Does it seem to embody a &ldquo;soul&rdquo; in more tangible form than you&rsquo;d expect== from our everyday casual-spiritual sense of the term?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Same tests applied to devices: ==Do you know where it keeps its intelligence? And Is it a legible piece of soul?==</p></blockquote><ul><li>Tested on Waldenponds:<ul><li>1.) No. Waldenponder object/activity pairs are shown as a device connected to a collation of inherited ==cultural intelligence==<ul><li>this cannot be investigated; you can only surrender to it through ==ritualistic behaviors==</li></ul></li><li>2.) Yes. They are the ==secular equivalents of temples.==</li></ul></li></ul><blockquote><p>First horcrux answer: Nope! ==Each object/activity pair is usually portrayed by waldenponders as a client device connected to a vast cloud of inherited cultural intelligence.== And they are right! Each of these objects/behavior is a classic horcrux candidate because it is ==old enough for illegible, unplottable patterns of cultural intelligence to have formed around it. You cannot probe this intelligence, only surrender to it through ceremonial, mythologized behaviors==</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Second horcrux answer: Yep! Waldenponders talk of these things as tangible embodiments and reliable catalysts of ineffable states of mind. They are ==secular equivalents of temples.==</p></blockquote><ul><li>Tested on devices:<ul><li>1.) Yes (e.g. RAM, data center, etc.)</li><li>2.) No. Digital life does not have an exact address, form, or predictable way to find it (which is why we rely so much on search functions).</li></ul></li></ul><blockquote><p>Answers: yes (it’s in ram, data center, etc.) and no (==While there is definitely a soul to digital life, it definitely does not have an exact address or form or a predictable way to find it.== The locus of &ldquo;soul&rdquo; in digital media is so nebulous, our entire experience of online life is necessarily built around search functions. Every day you must head out and look for a fresh glimpse of it, expecting it in unexpected places.)</p></blockquote><ul><li>Technology is all about innovation: finding what&rsquo;s new, and exploring it.<ul><li>No type/generation of technology has ever been solely responsible for soul-destruction, preservation, or enrichment.</li></ul></li></ul><blockquote><p>Technology is about constantly creating new vistas of experience, new unpaved territories for us to explore with cowpaths that then get paved. Some present tougher growth challenges for humans than others, but ==no particular type or generation of technology has a monopoly on soul-destruction, preservation, or enrichment.==</p></blockquote><ul><li>If you want to live richly, you must be willing to ==open yourself to the universe, and the experiences that it offers.==<ul><li>We build technology for the sake of accessing these experiences.</li><li>Challenge: to keep rediscovering what we consider sacred in new ways</li></ul></li></ul><blockquote><p>==To live richly is to trust your soul to the universe at large, and the experiences it offers that we build technology to access more of.== The opposite of keeping your soul in a known safe space is constantly looking for signs of it in the ==stream of experiences that constitute life itself,== and ==digital life== is a particularly rich new part of that stream. Our challenge is not to keep returning to a sense of the sacred in the same predictable place, but to ==keep rediscovering that predictable sense of the sacred in new places.==</p></blockquote><ul><li><a href=/3.-Permanent-Notes/Consistently-approach-the-universe rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/3.-Permanent-Notes/Consistently-approach-the-universe>3.
