—bell hooks, Teaching to Transgress”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“he encourages critical pedagogy, where the ==role of the educator== is to pose problems, create spaces for the collective development of critical consciousness, help to develop plans for action to make the world a better place, and develop a sense of agency among learners.”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“the goal of education is to transform oppressed individuals into subjects who engage in collective action to transform their conditions of oppression.”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“==critical community technology pedagogy==, an approach that “demystifies systemic power inequalities, involves a multi-directional learning process, results in transferable skills, and constructs a new world as it constructs knowledge.”</p></blockquote><p><a href=/3.-Permanent-Notes/Popular-education rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/3.-Permanent-Notes/Popular-education>3.

Permanent Notes/Praxis</a> is a Greek term that originally meant &ldquo;practical knowledge for action&rdquo;. Educator Paulo Freire defines it as &ldquo;reflection and action upon the world in order to transform it.&rdquo;</p><blockquote><p>“Freire focuses on developing critical thought together with action, in a cycle he refers to as praxis, a Greek term originally referring to ==“practical knowledge for action.”==7 Freire defines it as ==“reflection and action upon the world in order to transform it.”==</p></blockquote><p><a href=/3.-Permanent-Notes/Technology-must-be-used-as-a-tool-of-liberation rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/3.-Permanent-Notes/Technology-must-be-used-as-a-tool-of-liberation>3. Permanent Notes/Technology must be used as a tool of liberation</a></p><blockquote><p>“Instead of being used as a tool to divide and conquer, we believe technology must be taken back by the people and used as a tool of liberation.”</p></blockquote><p><a href=/3.-Permanent-Notes/Constructionism rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/3.-Permanent-Notes/Constructionism>3. Permanent Notes/Constructionism</a></p><blockquote><p>“constructionism. Although not explicit about race, class, gender, or disability politics, this is a pedagogical approach that ==centers context, situated knowledge, and learning by doing.==”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“for Piaget, learning is ==experiential==: it takes place through an active process where the learner develops the ability to modify or transform an object or idea.”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“constructionism’s two central concepts: first, that ==learning is a reconstruction==, rather than a transmission, of knowledge; second, that “learning is most effective when part of an activity the learner experiences as ==constructing a meaningful product.==”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“Resnick summarizes the core of constructionism in the following two principles: first, ==“people do not get ideas, they make them.”== Second, ==“people construct new knowledge with particular effectiveness when they are engaged in constructing personally meaningful products.”==</p></blockquote><p><a href=/3.-Permanent-Notes/Problem-based-learning rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/3.-Permanent-Notes/Problem-based-learning>3.

<a href=/3.-Permanent-Notes/Teachers-are-facilitators rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/3.-Permanent-Notes/Teachers-are-facilitators>3. Permanent Notes/Teachers are facilitators</a></p><blockquote><p>“teachers act as facilitators to help students achieve their own learning goals using problem-based learning.”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“Problem-based learning works best when problems are part of larger, ideally real-world tasks; learners are supported to take ownership of the problem; the task is appropriate to the learner’s level of understanding and ability; the learner must reflect on what is being learned and how they learned it; and the educator encourages the learner to test their ideas in various contexts.”</p></blockquote><p><a href=/3.-Permanent-Notes/Technological-fluency rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/3.-Permanent-Notes/Technological-fluency>3. Permanent Notes/Technological fluency</a></p><blockquote><p>“We need to expand the notion of ‘digital fluency’ to include ==designing and creating==, not just browsing and interacting.”</p><p>“technological fluency, or young people’s ability to fully incorporate computers and digital technology into their ==own creative practices.==”</p></blockquote><p><a href=/3.-Permanent-Notes/Decolonizing-design rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/3.-Permanent-Notes/Decolonizing-design>3.

Permanent Notes/Design is the foundation of the artificial world</a></p><blockquote><p>“design is no less than the conception and planning of the artificial world. Its products include ==objects, processes, systems, and environments==; in short, everything.”</p></blockquote><p><a href=/3.-Permanent-Notes/Educators-are-embodied-subjects rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/3.-Permanent-Notes/Educators-are-embodied-subjects>3. Permanent Notes/Educators are embodied subjects</a></p><blockquote><p>“Educators, hooks argues, must recognize ourselves as ==embodied subjects in the classroom==, rather than pretend that we speak from a disembodied place.”</p></blockquote><p><a href=/3.-Permanent-Notes/Design-Justice-Network-Principles rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/3.-Permanent-Notes/Design-Justice-Network-Principles>3.

Permanent Notes/Digital learning exacerbates and reproduces inequality</a></p><blockquote><p>“At the same time, as sociologist Tressie McMillan Cottom documents in her book Lower Ed: The Troubling Rise of For-Profit Colleges in the New Economy, for-profit universities that promise to teach coding skills and secure jobs for their graduates proliferate both on and offline.93 Many of the most visible for-profit coding schools and boot camps are ==expensive, inaccessible, and have dubious placement outcomes.==94”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“digital learning among young people remains ==structured== by race, class, and gender.”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“In a recent study of digital learning, education researchers Mimi Ito and Justin Reich find that, in many cases, digital learning technologies such as MOOCs and online courses, in-school computing classes, and other interventions ==actually exacerbate inequalities in learning outcomes== between low-income and wealthier students, between students of color and white students, and between male and female students. In addition, they note that the use of digital technology in education often ==unintentionally reproduces inequality==, in large part due to “institutionalized and unconscious bias and social distance between developers and those they seek to serve.”</p></blockquote><p><a href=/3.-Permanent-Notes/The-object-of-true-education-is-to-make-people rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/3.-Permanent-Notes/The-object-of-true-education-is-to-make-people>3. Permanent Notes/The object of true education is to make people</a></p><blockquote><p>“I insist that the object of all true education is not to make people carpenters, it is to make carpenters people.
—W. E. B. Du Bois, The Talented Tenth”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“Is the ultimate object to make people good coders, or to make coders good people?”</p></blockquote><p><a href=/3.-Permanent-Notes/Critical-thinking-and-skill-development-are-not-mutually-exclusive rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/3.-Permanent-Notes/Critical-thinking-and-skill-development-are-not-mutually-exclusive>3. Permanent Notes/Critical thinking and skill development are not mutually exclusive</a></p><blockquote><p>“learning to code is increasingly taught in ways that emphasize diversity, creativity, and critical thinking.”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“design pedagogies that promote critical thinking are not incompatible with the development of practical design skills.”</p></blockquote></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li><a href=/2.-Literature-Notes/The-McDonaldization-of-Education-the-rise-of-slow-Literature-Notes/ data-ctx="2.
