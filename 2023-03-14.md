#EDUC101i #education #history #philosophy 
_Finally, we will meet a few contemporary thinkers that continue to influence educational practices today._
### Modern Times
#### John Amos Comenius: Father of Modern Education
##### Comenius School for Creative Leadership
- i think the school is one of theplaces where kids really havethe opportunity to just expressthemselves and learn and really justcome into the presence of god
- ilove the new homework policyonce we got here they've had time to doall other things besides academics theirmusic or athletics and that kind ofthing 
- leadershipwe took our name from john amos comeniushe was a 16th century educator whobelieved that all children shouldhave a great education not just thechildren of nobilitynot just males but females and childrenof all ages and all socialeconomic status
- the mission of thecommunist school for creative leadershipis to raise up and educate this emergentgeneration of leadersto strive for excellence and to become apositive influencein the world
#### [Father of Modern Education](https://youtu.be/NgBJytXcCLI)
- Comenius was a deeply religious man, and his religious beliefs shaped his philosophy of education.
	- He believed that all people were created in God's image; therefore, everyone deserves access to an education regardless of social and economic class and gender.
	- This is sometimes called a universa leducation
-  Comenius believed that all people should thoroughly learn every subject from a Christian perspective. To him, education and religion were inseparable; gaining an education helped people to build God's kingdom on earth. 
- The purpose of education was to fulfill **the 12 Human Desires**:
	- To live 
	- To have an enduring healthy life
	- To know one's surroundings, that is, a perceptive life 
	- To have understanding, that is, an enlightened life 
	- To have a life of freedom, that is, to wish and choose what one understands to be good and to refuse and reject the evil 
	- To have an active life 
	- To have and hold many possessions
	- To enjoy the use of property with a sense of security 
	- To live an honorable life 
	- To be able to communicate with others effectively 
	- To have a peaceful life 
	- To have eternal life
- Comenius called life **The School of God's Wisdom.** This was divided into three different schools:
	- The Physical School: consisted of the book of nature or the physical world around us. Here, we use our senses to gain knowledge
	- The Metaphysical School: involved the book of the human mind. Here, people would use their mind and reason to analyze and discover complex concepts.
	- The Hyperphysical School: dealt with things of God as found in the Holy Scriptures. In this school, learning is done by faith.
- the education ofchildren needed to be developmentallyappropriate he needed to build uponprior knowledge what we would callscaffolding today education should beenjoyable with positive reinforcementfostering the love of learning
- children learnbest through hands-on experientiallearning it also needed to go at thechild's pace and follow their interestsand talents
- In conclusion, John Amos Comenius believed that as God's children, everyone should use their senses reason and faithto voluntarily gain a thorough educationof God and the world he created so theycould fulfill the 12 human desires

#### Jean Jacques Rosseau: Realizing the Natural Self
Here we'll meet another modern thinker, Jean Jacques Rousseau.Â Rousseau was an 18th century philosopher who later became known as a revolutionary philosopher on education and a forerunner of Romanticism.

##### Naturalism Summary
1. **What is education for?**
	1. systemso when you think about it uma lot of the perceptions about whateducation is for maybe apart from thehumanists that took a moreindividualistic perspectivea lot of the other perspectives arereally coming from a perspective thateducation is to prepare a personfor something outside the person (e.g. religion/philosophy/society)
	2. one thing that the naturalists recognizeis nature and when they talk aboutnature it's not justnature meaning what you see outside liketrees the environment but also thenature of a personthatthey use this particular notion to shapetheir particular philosophywherein what they're saying here is thateducation is not necessarily to make apersonsomeone other than the personas if there was something wrong with theperson fundamentally butwe have to begin to recognize thateveryone is fundamentally good or atleast that's what they believed in andsince everyone is fundamentally goodif the goal of education is to shape agood personthen the role of education is reallyjust to allow the person to be good orto allow the person to develop to be thegood person that they are naturally arethey naturally are
2. **What is the "bias"?**
	1. Naturalists will probably have a bias for ==human instincts==
	2. for naturalists this is one of thebiggest ideas most especially in termsof methodology of educationthat for them and their perspective it'simportant just to allow a child to be achild to allow a child toto grow in their own particular wayto allow their instincts to not restricttheir instincts
	3. Contrast to [[Monasticism]]
	4. for them discipline should benatural should be driven by naturalpunishment meaning just allow thenatural consequences to happen and theywill learn from itsomaybe
3. **How should education be?**
	1. [[Naturalism]] is a bridge between sense realism and developmentalism 
	2. naturalism definitely builds on thisit acknowledges that this is animportant part of learning and educationshould be like this but builds on thisand extends thethe definition of of realismuh by saying that when you talk aboutwhat rea what is real we have to look atnature and nature not just in terms ofthe environment uh but also the natureof the person and when we look at thenature of the person one thing thatnaturalism will say is that everyone isinertly good and so the goal ofeducation is just to bring out thatgoodness and to allow that goodness toflourishsome
		1. some of you might feel like oh my thisis pretty extreme right like no controldo we mean no control do we just allowstudents to go as they areand maybe to a certain extent this iswhypure naturalism is not so much existentin modern education todaysowhat
	3. psychological developmentalism is reallysomething that builds on this or thatrecognizes some of the limitations ofthe perspective of naturalistsand sort of cures itand when you look at developmentalismyou'll begin to recognize that most ofthese thingsare quite close to current practiceso

##### Key Ideas about [[Naturalism]]
1. **Nature v.s. "artificial"**
	1. "Return to the natural as opposed to all that is artificial" (244)
	2. Naturalism opposed many existing paradigms and practices in education:
		1. "Education as a procedure to be *imposed* from without"
		2. Specialization: Education aimed at *producing* workers, citizens, and members of society. "Education, in making a worker or a citizen, made him less a man."
		3. "The child is *not to be swaddled*, confined, or rocked but must be allowed the utmost freedom of limb and voice...""
2. **Nature of individual growth**
	1. "To educate an individual, one must understand the nature of his growth" (244)
	2. Naturalism proposes that morality be naturally developed from consequence.
		1. "Rosseau merely permitted the pupil to suffer the natural results of his own acts."
	3. Naturalism proposed that education followed nature
		1. Organization *(Individual first, social after)*
			1. Infancy
			2. Childhood
			3. Boyhood
			4. Adolescence
		2. Order of Nature *(Principle of Growth)*
			1. Need 
			2. Activity
			3. Experience
			4. Knowledge
3. **Nature as content and method**
	1. "Educatirs should 'diligently observe nature and learn from her' study her methods and base their own upon them" (244)
	3. Naturalism proposed that education should be experienced.
		1. Principle of pupil-activity
		2. "Nothing must be done for the pupil that he can do for himself"
		3. "Do not give your pupil any sort of verbal lesson, for he is to be taught only by experience."
		4. "The teach must start with these elements which the child's senses can grasp, and attempt always to associate the 'the word and the object referred to'" (Cornenius)
	4. Naturalism considers learners as individuals.
		1. Principle of individualization
		2. "The interests and needs of the individual must be placed above those of society: individuality must not be sacrificed for social stability."
		3. "Do not undertake any teaching...without first arousing the interest of the pupil" (Cornenius)
		4. "The children will be engaging in studies which will given them as much pleasure as if they had spent the day playing games." (Cornenius)
