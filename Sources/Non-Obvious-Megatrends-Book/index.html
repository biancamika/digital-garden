Fads describe something that’s briefly popular but doesn’t last. Great trends reflect a mo- ment in time, but that moment is never fleeting, and the basic idea is more elevated. Good trends always focus on the shift in an underlying human behavior or belief. They don’t describe a sin- gle interesting story or a hot new product or industry.<ul><li>LOCATION: Page 46</li></ul></li><li>Trend spotting isn’t the same as identifying actual trends.

I have referred to this state of affairs as our “modern believability crisis,” when we are unsure of whom and what to be- lieve or where to place our attention.<ul><li>LOCATION: Page 139</li></ul></li><li>Surrounded by so much noise from brands, media outlets, and politicians vying for our attention and blurring the line between what’s real or not, we’ve become good at selectively focusing out of necessity. To do so, we are turning inward to our core beliefs and aligning ourselves with those who share them. In the process, we are also becoming more closed off to perspectives that differ from our own, a trend we called Truthing back in 2018. One of the effects of this introspective trend is that we are increasingly entrusting our attention to individual curators to help spotlight where we should spend our attention wealth.<ul><li>LOCATION: Page 144</li></ul></li><li>In an information economy, attention is the currency.<ul><li>LOCATION: Page 144</li></ul></li><li>Purposeful Profit<ul><li>LOCATION: Page 146</li></ul></li><li>As consumers and employees demand more sustainable and ethical practices from businesses, companies re- spond by adapting products, taking stands on issues, and putting purpose first.<ul><li>LOCATION: Page 146</li></ul></li><li>Two voices leading the connection between purpose, mindfulness and organizational performance are Dr. Eliza Shah and Paresh Shah, founders of Lifter Leadership. Their groundbreaking research has identified “Lifters,” an emerging segment that spans all age groups and can be trained to drive purpose, innovation, work- place health and change. Lifters are positive, purposeful workers who simultaneously uplift their co-workers, customers, communities and their company.<ul><li>LOCATION: Page 146</li></ul></li><li>In the past, brands would limit themselves to “soft branding” of cause-related initiatives—preferring to take a quiet role as an invisible supporter rather than taking a public stand. This was once the best way for a corpo- ration to support initiatives that aligned with its core values without feeling overtly promotional.<ul><li>LOCATION: Page 148</li></ul></li><li>Data Abundance<ul><li>LOCATION: Page 152</li></ul></li><li>The growing ubiquity of data and the myriad ways it can be collected raise big questions about how to make it truly useful, who owns the data, and who should stand to profit from it.<ul><li>LOCATION: Page 153</li></ul></li><li>In addition to all this data collected by organizations and information shared online by individuals, there is one other source of considerable data that is increasingly being made publicly available: “open data.” This term refers to the vast stores of data dumped online by companies and governments in the name of transparency or regulatory compliance.<ul><li>LOCATION: Page 154</li></ul></li><li>When it comes to data, quality is far more important than quantity<ul><li>LOCATION: Page 158</li></ul></li><li>A story in the Washington Post reported that teenagers are curating their accounts on Instagram and deleting old photos that either did not get many likes or no longer were wanted on their profiles. But when users delete old posts, that alters their page views and engagement time stats, skewing the data that Instagram is trying to monetize. The less accurate their data, the fewer opportunities there are to sell advertising. Desperate to stop users from deleting the data its business model depends on, Instagram introduced a feature that allows users to archive their old images instead of deleting them. As we continue to generate more data, there will be growing urgency to ensure the data is in good enough shape to be usable.<ul><li>LOCATION: Page 158</li></ul></li><li>In other words, having access to a treasure trove of data collected by wearable devices doesn’t necessarily translate to health providers finding meaning in it. Even patients struggle to find real value in the data beyond “feel-good stats.” The devices provide plenty of pats on the back, for example, displaying celebratory firework icons every time the user reaches an arbitrary goal, such as walking 10,000 steps in a day. The result is plenty of data collection, yet potentially little impact on long-term health or happiness from it.<ul><li>LOCATION: Page 164</li></ul></li><li>Although we willingly trade our data, we remain concerned about how such details are used, a point I wrote about back in 2014 with a trend we called Privacy Paranoia . Still, the reason we do it is because we are under the influence of what behavioral economics call benefit immediacy : We share information willingly because the benefits of doing so are immediate while the risks are delayed.<ul><li>LOCATION: Page 169</li></ul></li><li>Protective Tech<ul><li>LOCATION: Page 173</li></ul></li><li>As we increasingly rely on predictive technology that keeps us and our world safe and makes life more conve- nient, we must contend with the privacy trade-offs required to make it work.<ul><li>LOCATION: Page 173</li></ul></li><li>The tension between the desire for smart tech to help us manage our lives—in this case, our health—and our worry that it might infringe on privacy will only grow as this tech becomes more ubiquitous. It raises a natural question: Should we cede so many health and life decisions to machines?<ul><li>LOCATION: Page 178</li></ul></li><li>As the Protective Tech megatrend plays out over the coming decade, a generation of young consumers will ex- pect technology to optimize every waking moment of their lives. But as they become dependent on technology to take care of the mundane tasks of adulting, will they also lose the ability to handle more nuanced parts of having human relationships and turn to technology for those as well?<ul><li>LOCATION: Page 181</li></ul></li><li>Predictive smart technology already makes our lives more convenient and safer. But in order to provide real- time utility, these technologies have to “listen,” collecting information about us and our environment 24/7. As protective tech becomes more sophisticated, it will lead to more debates about how much of our daily lives should be trackable and how important personal privacy and individual liberties are when weighed against the broader interests of society.<ul><li>LOCATION: Page 182</li></ul></li><li>As learning technology gets smarter, it’s evolution will largely come from watching humans and parsing the media that humans create—which leads to an unusual chal- lenge for humanity. Just as we must serve as role models for our children, increasingly we will need to serve that same role for our technology as well.<ul><li>LOCATION: Page 183</li></ul></li><li>Flux Commerce<ul><li>LOCATION: Page 184</li></ul></li><li>As the lines between industries erode, how we sell and buy anything changes constantly, leading to a con- tinual disruption of business models, distribution channels, consumer expectations and even innovation it- self.<ul><li>LOCATION: Page 185</li></ul></li><li>The enthusiasm around a “fad” has always been intense and viral. But fad fatigue has had a tremendous ef- fect on how we buy (or not buy) products. We are simply moving on to the next flavor of the month faster and faster. This has put companies under tremendous pressure to find new ways to innovate. They are trying to find the “next big thing” and fear that nothing less than a complete overhaul of their business will be necessary to assure their relevance and survival. It has led some of the more desperate to naively look to recreate exactly what they see more innovative competitors doing—a trend we described as Innovation Envy in 2019.<ul><li>LOCATION: Page 191</li></ul></li><li>Often, companies will mistake invention for innovation. They are not the same thing. This com- mon mistake can lead to shallow ideation, one-dimensional product or service ideas, and undif- ferentiated engagement with your customers. Look beyond products to consider new business models that integrate greater purpose and deliver more robust experiences that delight cus- tomers.<ul><li>LOCATION: Page 191</li></ul></li><li>Likeonomics Brands, products, and services succeed by being more human, mission driven, and personally likeable through their policies and people, gaining an advantage over less empathetic competitors.<ul><li>LOCATION: Page 199</li></ul></li><li>Culting of Retail The best retailers create passionate users who not only buy products, but also rave about their experiences.
