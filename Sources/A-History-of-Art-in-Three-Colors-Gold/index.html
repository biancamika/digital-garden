He was entrusted with the production and protection of Egypt&rsquo;s gold. So carved into the walls of his tomb are depictions of his invaluable work&mldr;particularly <strong>the entire gold-making process</strong><ul><li>1st step: weighing of gold<ul><li>Even if gold was abundant, it was still valuable to the point that nothing was unaccounted for</li></ul></li><li>Remarkable hieroglyphs:<ul><li>A master telling his slave to get his ass moving</li><li>All four goldsmiths are ==dwarfs==; dwarfs are depicted as gold workers because they were actually perceived by ancient Egyptians as possessing ==magical powers.==</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Most of the gold smiths&rsquo; creations were hidden away from view and/or stolen&mldr;until <strong>archaeologist Howard Carter</strong> came along. He broke into the tomb of <strong>Tutankhamen</strong> and found all his treasures<ul><li>The most astounding treasure found here was the death mask of Tutankhamen: 11kg solid gold, bejwelled, exquisitely crafted.<ul><li>Tender: big ears, fleshy lips, wide innocent eyes to make the face come to life</li></ul></li><li>Why was everything in gold? This isn&rsquo;t a statement of wealth&mldr;rather it shows how people believed that <strong>gold had magical powers</strong><ul><li>Same color as the sun; never tarnishes</li><li>Perhaps Tut was hoping the magic would rub off on him</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><a href=#rome><h3 id=rome><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Rome</h3></a><ul><li>Pagan gods were banished and replaced with a single creator &ndash; the Christian God. This is all thanks to Emperor Constantine<ul><li>The one new idea of Christianity: <strong>distaste for wealth, extravagance, ostentatious display</strong></li><li>This led to gold, a modern luxury, no longer being worshipped</li></ul></li><li>But gold made a comeback thanks to a new artform: <strong>Byzantine art</strong><ul><li>Why was gold deemed appropriate in this context? Here, it represents not material things, but ==immaterial things.== Perhaps it&rsquo;s suited to portray God, the most immaterial of them all</li><li>The backgrounds of icons are generally gold. They represent the ==all-pervading presence of God.== It reflects light, it gives light. It&rsquo;s radiant with God.<ul><li>The reflective qualities of light show how a life with God is dynamic, not static. Color is transformed from murky brown to shimmering yellow</li><li>Gold became the color of the light of God</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>In the 6th century AD, <strong>Byzantine Emperor Justinian</strong> built the <strong>basilica</strong> of <strong>San Vitale</strong> in Ravenna<ul><li>Showcases one of the greatest inventions of the Byzantine age: <strong>gold tesseras.</strong> These are individual tiles (often squares) that are used to ==create mosaics.==</li><li>They trap all of the light in this church, and then the glass like a lens amplifies that light.<ul><li>The light is not blinding like electricity; it sparkles, glimmers, and glistens</li><li>Must&rsquo;ve felt like looking into heaven</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>The early Christians who had once renounced all things golden, had, like the ancients before them, used the colour ingeniously to bring themselves closer to their God.</li></ul><a href=#renaissance><h3 id=renaissance><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Renaissance</h3></a><ul><li>Heaven seemed to lose its monopoly on gold&mldr;and gold would become a potent force in more ==worldly affairs.==</li><li>Now gold was used to satisfy the vanity of kings, queens, and their courts<ul><li>E.G. <strong>Queen Elizabeth I</strong> giving out <strong>solid gold cameos</strong> with her face to her most trusted courtiers</li></ul></li><li>So while it&rsquo;s gold, it&rsquo;s no longer really about the sacred. What it&rsquo;s really about is <strong>power, politics and, above all, status.</strong><ul><li>Kings and queens looked for the best goldsmiths to outshine their rivals</li></ul></li><li><strong>Ponte Vecchio in Florence:</strong> one of the great centres of gold work. People would sell their wares here. But the goldsmith most sought after was <strong>Benvenuto Cellini.</strong><ul><li>the only goldsmith to get a statue.</li><li>Cellini was fastidious in recording his many ingenious techniques</li><li>Cellini&rsquo;s legacy lives on at the studio of <strong>Paolo Penko</strong>, a Florentine goldsmith who&rsquo;s been following Cellini ever since he was little</li><li>Cellini was a troublemaker; he was charged with various crimes. But <strong>King Francis I of France</strong> was willing to forgive him of everything in order to make his kingdom the center of the renaissance<ul><li>He commissioned Cellini to make a solid gold salt cellar. Cellini ended up taking over 3 years on this project, but it became the masterpiece that defined his career<ul><li>2 gods: Neptune (sea) and Terra (land)</li><li>Salt was an incredibly important substance in the 16th century (made up much of King Francis&rsquo; revenue), which is why it was worth putting in gold</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Augustus the Strong</strong> was a ruler whose lust for gold was so strong&mldr;he would&rsquo;ve stolen this cellar<ul><li>Favorite sport: fox tossing</li><li>Depicted in a statue known as The Golden Rider</li><li>His desire was to be seen as one of the great rulers of European history, and the secret to achieving that ambition was gold.</li><li>He had a dream of unlimited gold&mldr;which led him to <strong>Friedrich Bottger</strong>, a 19-year-old alchemist who seemingly achieved the miracle of transmutation,<ul><li>Freidrich was imprisoned by Augustus. He couldn&rsquo;t produce gold, of course&mldr;but he was able to produce a ==golden sun mask==, which was modelled on Augustus&rsquo; features</li><li>It was made of copper, with a bit of gold put on top of it<ul><li>It embodies that desperate desire of Augustus to enter the pantheon of the great gods and the great kings, but also shows how he wasn&rsquo;t powerful and rich enough to become one of them</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>George Richards Elkington</strong> was a step closer to this dream though&mldr;he patented a way to make gold objects out of almost nothing. This was a process called <strong>electro-plating:</strong> ==harnessing electricity to make gold objects.==<ul><li>Prince Albert visited and was captivated by this&mldr;he then asked to have his own electro-plating suite</li><li>People liked electro-plating because it was cheap. It doesn&rsquo;t really produce solid gold. All it does is produce a color. Hence why it can be called ==Elkington&rsquo;s fool&rsquo;s gold==</li><li>This innovation allowed the public to own their very own piece of gold, even if it wasn&rsquo;t pure. ==It democratized gold==</li></ul></li><li><strong>Gustav Klimt&rsquo;s</strong> The Kiss<ul><li>almost every single kind of golden substance was thrown on this canvas (e.g. eight different kinds of gold leaf alone)</li><li>Why so much gold? This could be seen as part of his desperate attempt to ==bring back gold from the brink. ==<ul><li>He has lived through a period when gold has become debased, cheap, and tacky (thanks to democratization)</li><li>He&rsquo;s trying to say, &ldquo;No, gold is the most precious thing we have. It&rsquo;s the most numinous, spiritual, other-worldly thing we have and therefore we have to devote it to the most important things in the world&rdquo;&mldr;which was <strong>love</strong></li><li>Ironic how his work has been endlessly reproduced now</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><a href=#cues><h2 id=cues><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Cues</h2></a><ul><li>Magic<ul><li>Dwarfs</li><li>Sun god</li><li>Doesn&rsquo;t tarnish</li></ul></li><li>Material -> immaterial</li><li>Light of God</li><li>Tessera</li><li>Sacred -> worldly</li><li>Transmutation</li><li>Electro-plating</li><li>Elkington&rsquo;s fool&rsquo;s gold</li></ul><a href=#summary><h2 id=summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h2></a><ul><li>We&rsquo;re so obsessed with gold because gold reflects the things that every society holds <strong>most sacred.</strong><ul><li>Ancient Egyptians: the sun and the afterlife</li><li>The Christians: the light of God</li><li>The Renaissance Kings: power and status</li><li>Gustav Klimt: love and sex</li><li>Bank of England: money</li></ul></li></ul></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li><a href=/Atlas/Maps/IDS-143_03-MOC/ data-ctx="Sources/A History of Art in Three Colors - Gold" data-src=/Atlas/Maps/IDS-143_03-MOC class=internal-link>"IDS 143_03 MOC"</a></li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://garden.bianca.digital/js/graph.abd4bc2af3869a96524d7d23b76152c7.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by Bianca Aguilar using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, © 2023</p><ul><li><a href=https://garden.bianca.digital/>Home</a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/biancamikaila>Twitter</a></li><li><a href=https://are.na/bianca-aguilar>Are.na</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
