Prompt engineering can also control the model’s output’s length, complexity, and style. For example, prompts can be designed to elicit short, simple responses for beginner students or more complex, detailed responses for advanced learners. Prompt engineering can also generate messages appropriate for patient education and mass media campaigns. Moreover, prompt engineering can help minimize potential pitfalls, such as the generation of incorrect or misleading information. Educators can guide the model with carefully crafted prompts to provide more accurate and reliable information.</li><li><a href=https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3568812.3603453 rel=noopener>Prompt Engineering for Large Language Models to Support K-8 Computer Science Teachers in Creating Culturally Responsive Projects</a></li><li><a href=https://faculty.washington.edu/theston/repository/2023-Prompt-Engineering-for-Students-of-Medicine-and-Their-Teachers.pdf rel=noopener>Prompt Engineering For Students of Medicine and Their Teachers</a></li></ul></li></ul><a href=#example-projects><h5 id=example-projects><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Example projects</h5></a><ul><li><a href=https://ilab.ucalgary.ca/static/publications/chi-2022-ivanov.pdf rel=noopener>One Week in the Future: Previs Design Futuring for HCI Research</a><ul><li>Sprint participants prepared document summarizing process, reflections, and outcomes<ul><li>Researchers then examined these summaries and extracted a collection of unique observations, which were then clustered into themes</li></ul></li><li>Futuring opportunities<ul><li>Alternate mediums and concept fidelities<ul><li>Sprint and workbook format can support alternatives</li></ul></li><li>Rapid scene building tools<ul><li>Plethora of available assets is needed to quickly layout a a 3D scene; without such resources, it would be too timely/costly for an individual designer</li><li>But relying on preexisting assets also constrained the design of concepts</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><a href=https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3411764.3445093 rel=noopener>FashionQ: An AI-Driven Creativity Support Tool for Facilitating Ideation in Fashion Design</a><ul><li>We developed AI models by externalizing three cognitive operations (extending, constraining, and blending) that are associated with divergent and convergent thinking.</li></ul></li><li><a href=https://fashionandtextiles.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40691-023-00360-w rel=noopener>Developing an AI-based automated fashion design system: reflecting the work process of fashion designers</a></li><li><a href=https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3501914 rel=noopener>StoryDrawer: A Child–AI Collaborative Drawing System to Support Children&rsquo;s Creative Visual Storytelling</a><ul><li>The system includes a context-based voice agent and two AI-driven collaborative strategies: the real-time transformation of children&rsquo;s telling into drawings, and the generation of abstract sketches with semantic similarity to existing story content.</li></ul></li><li><a href=https://computationalcreativity.net/iccc23/papers/ICCC-2023_paper_34.pdf rel=noopener>Recipe 2.0: Information Presentation for AI-Supported Culinary Idea Generation</a></li><li><a href=https://www.mdpi.com/2075-5309/13/9/2285 rel=noopener>Using Artificial Intelligence to Generate Master-Quality Architectural Designs from Text Descriptions</a><ul><li>To help ordinary designers improve the design quality, we propose a new artificial intelligence (AI) method for generative architectural design, which generates designs with specified styles and master architect quality through a diffusion model based on textual prompts of the design requirements.</li><li>Compared to conventional methods dependent on heavy intellectual labor for innovative design and drawing, the proposed method substantially enhances the creativity and efficiency of the design process.

Unfortunately, many of them struggle in designing and undertaking this kind of impactful research due to a lack of funding, support, visibility and recognition. Additionally, in the human-computer interaction (HCI) field, ECRs could also be blocked by the limitations of established methods.</p><p>One such example is human-centered design (HCD): “an approach to interactive systems development that aims to make systems usable and useful by focusing on the users, their needs and requirements, and by applying human factors/ergonomics, and usability knowledge and techniques”. Its widespread influence can be found in its core adoption across many computing, design, and management projects in industry, academia, and government. But while it is effective at delivering popular and effective interactive systems, HCD&rsquo;s focus on individual people or groups gives it a narrow temporal and contextual focus.</p><p>One limitation of HCD is its limited perception of time, which can be seen in designers&rsquo; tendency to design something new for the <em>current</em> world, instead of designing a completely <em>new</em> world. This is because HCI design and development is an iterative engineering process, wherein design is gradually improved by a growing understanding of the users and the context of use. Thus, while HCD may be suitable for incremental improvements, it is a not a fit driver of breakthrough innovation. Another flaw of HCD is that it often misses out on ethical, societal, and political aspects. HCD and its ISO, ISO 9241-210, have been criticized for lacking consideration of user security and privacy, along with being too rigid to adapt to local cultural contexts. And since human values are often not touched on in HCD, HCI researchers usually do not critically evaluate the potential consequences of their work.</p><p>If ECRs in the Global South believe that high-quality research must be beneficial and groundbreaking, then it is crucial for them to utilize more radical design methods. Enter design futuring: a type of approach to design that is &ldquo;concerned with future alternatives&rdquo; and seeks to &ldquo;produce knowledge through [discourse]&rdquo; (instead of being used to solve an immediate problem). It not only helps design researchers generate and communicate new ideas, but also contemplate the social and technical implications of their work. However, producing design fictions often requires proficiency in creative software, preexisting assets, and time — things many researchers may lack, especially if they&rsquo;re located in the Global South. Thus, there is a need for the development of creative tools that can support rapid prototyping for design futuring.</p><p>Given its meteoric development, generative AI (i.e. AI technologies that automatically generate written or visual content based on text prompts) has the potential to bring these kind of tools to life. In line with this, we propose an AI-enabled creativity support tool that rapidly envisions future aspects of a researcher&rsquo;s area of interest, building on Ivanov et. al&rsquo;s design futuring sprint method. This paper is a preliminary study that explores how generative AI can help ECRs in the Global South imagine, evaluate, and consider the implications of their works, so that they can work towards high-quality innovation. This study aims to make a dataset of prompts for fine-tuning a model designed to generate fictional depictions of the future; this would then be used in the development of the proposed creativity support tool.</p><ul><li>Why is there a need for ECRs in the Global South better methods?<ul><li>universalist and solutionist notions of design as a way out of structural inequality</li><li>Western hegemony is problematic<ul><li>such templates reflect universalism and solutionism</li></ul></li><li>Paradigms informing design and development projects in the global south are rooted in Western epistemologies that are at best biased and at worst racist</li></ul></li></ul><a href=#background-and-related-work><h6 id=background-and-related-work><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Background and Related Work</h6></a><p><strong>Background: Design Futuring in HCI Research + Practice</strong></p><p><strong>Related Work: AI-Enabled Creative Tools for Design Futuring</strong>
Generative AI tools have made creative exploration more accessible, thanks to rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models. Popular examples of these tools, such as ChatGPT and Dall-E, implement a low-floor, high-ceiling and wide-walls principle: they have a low barrier of entry (low floor), allowing users to achieve high-quality outputs (high-ceiling) that can extend to extend to a broad range of applications (wide walls). Acting as an &ldquo;engine for the imagination&rdquo;, generative AI has been specifically been used to support the creative processes of ideation and creation. While it has already been applied to creative activities like visual storytelling and culinary innovation, it is most especially prominent in design, with fields like industrial design, fashion design, and architecture.</p><p>Despite generative AI&rsquo;s widespread adoption in several creative activities, its use in speculative and critical design remains underexplored. But generative AI has already shown to be useful across a spectrum of envisioning speculative futures, from practical forecasting to creative storytelling. Applications of generative AI have started to demonstrate their potential for collective design futuring, encouraging discourse on societal issues like climate change. Overall, all of these examples show that &ldquo;AI can serve as a subjective interface linking fiction and reality&rdquo;. Our project contributes to this growing body of work by exploring how generative AI can be act as an interface that connects the realities of researchers with the futures they desire.</p><p>There is an opportunity to assess how generative AI can play a more active role — what if it was not just a tool, but also a collaborator? AI-driven co-creative tools are less involved in the early stages of co-creation (i.e. researching, incubating). This is because of the misconception that machines lack the ability to evaluate and distinguish mundane outputs from masterpieces, along with concerns for accountability, responsibility, and fairness in human-AI interaction. However, the data-driven, non-human mind of AI offers much potential for redefining and repositioning early stages of the creative process; even without setting creativity as the target for optimization, AI can introduce intriguing perspectives that may fall out of humans’ sights. For example: when Lyu, Hao, and Yi embedded generative AI into the design futuring process, it served multiple functions: signal scanning, scenario development, world-building, and more.</p><p>But AI must still be used with caution; without intentional human guidance, machine-generated visions may be harmful and insubstantial. For instance, in response to Seattle leaders using AI imagery to promote a &ldquo;downtown of the future&rdquo;, Wolfe discussed the following challenges that AI-enabled design futuring can bring about: (1) the data being used to train AI may contain biases and inequalities, which may lead AI to perpetuate marginalization; (2) AI may be unable to account for evolving needs, given that it is trained on a limited set of data; (3) without definitional prompts, AI lacks contextual understanding, which can lead to generic outputs; and (4) AI may prioritize standards like efficiency and aesthetics over the human experience. To ensure human-centered outputs, an AI-enabled design futuring tool will require meticulous prompt engineering. It will also require user education. Usually, users are forced to be hands-off when using AI co-creative tools due to a lack of knowledge on how the tools work, what level of complexity to expect in the output, and how machines optimize their behaviors. This particularly occurs with generative AI; when users get unsatisfying outputs, they have limited guidance for making improvement. In light of these considerations, this study would like to investigate how to develop a thoughtful AI futurist.</p><ul><li>Background: Design Futuring in HCI Research<ul><li>Design futuring for researchers<ul><li>One Week Into the Future</li></ul></li><li>Design futuring for marginalized communities<ul><li>Black frameworks for Black communities</li></ul></li><li>Research gap: we can see how futuring can help HCI researchers and marginalized communities, but we don&rsquo;t know how it could benefit researchers from marginalized communities</li></ul></li></ul><a href=#methodology-1><h6 id=methodology-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Methodology</h6></a><p>We will be conducting a pilot study primarily aimed at answering our research question: <strong>How can generative AI best support the design futuring process?</strong></p><p><strong>Participants</strong>
Through convenience sampling, we will be recruiting five participants: computer science students working at a university research laboratory in the Philippines. Given their technical background, they are expected to already be familiar with using generative AI tools (e.g. ChatGPT, Dall-E). They should also be currently working on a research project, since they will be required to explore it in the pilot study.</p><p><strong>Study Design</strong>
The participants will go through a 90-120 minute workshop based on the first day of Ivanov et. al&rsquo;s design futuring sprint. We will be using a within-subjects design where all participants do the activities on their own, and then try doing the same activities with the help of generative AI. The workshop will consist of the following parts:</p><ul><li><strong>Introduction:</strong> The workshop facilitator will give a participants an overview of the workshop. Then, the participants will be shown guidelines on prompt engineering, to help them with the upcoming workshop activities.</li><li><strong>Research Review:</strong> The participants will write about their area of study, using the canvas template from Ivanov et. al&rsquo;s workbook (Figure 1). Then, after writing their own answers, the participants will use ChatGPT 4 to answer each section in the canvas. Answers written by both the participants and ChatGPT will be placed beside each other for easy comparison.</li><li><strong>Generating Exercise:</strong> Once they have an overview of their domain, the participants will use DALL-E 3 to generate fictional depictions of the future, in response to six prompts (Figure 2). After generating images on their own, the participants will refer ChatGPT 4 as an industry expert, asking it how it would answer those prompts. These prompts would then be translated into images with ChatGPT 4. Similar to the previous activity, images made by descriptions from both the participants and ChatGPT will be placed beside each other for easy comparison.</li><li><strong>Focus Group Discussion:</strong> After a short break, the facilitator will interview the participants about their experience with design futuring, and how generative AI affected this.</li></ul><p><strong>Documentation and Analysis</strong>
The workshop will take place remotely via Zoom, allowing for easy recording. We will be using a shared Figjam whiteboard throughout the whole workshop; all prompts and outputs (i.e. answers, images) will be placed here. To evaluate the participants&rsquo; experience with generative AI, we will be transcribing and conducting a thematic analysis of the FGD.</p><ul><li><a href=https://ai.torchbox.com/thinking/2023-06-16-generative-ai-powerful-tools-to-imagine-explore-better-futures rel=noopener>https://ai.torchbox.com/thinking/2023-06-16-generative-ai-powerful-tools-to-imagine-explore-better-futures</a></li></ul><a href=#limitations-and-future-work><h6 id=limitations-and-future-work><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Limitations and Future Work</h6></a><ul><li>explore how AI-enabled design futuring works for different groups. how national and cultural demographics (e.g. WEIRD) influence aesthetics. what do people consider positive and negative?<ul><li>can tie in how to make AI adaptable? and less biased?</li></ul></li></ul></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li><a href=/Atlas/Maps/Projects-MOC/ data-ctx="Atlas/Projects/AI-Enabled Design Futuring" data-src=/Atlas/Maps/Projects-MOC class=internal-link>Projects MOC</a></li><li><a href=/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2023-07-23/ data-ctx="AI-Enabled Design Futuring" data-src=/Miscellaneous-Notes/Daily-Notes/2023-07-23 class=internal-link>2023-07-23</a></li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://garden.bianca.digital/js/graph.abd4bc2af3869a96524d7d23b76152c7.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by Bianca Aguilar using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, © 2023</p><ul><li><a href=https://garden.bianca.digital/>Home</a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/biancamikaila>Twitter</a></li><li><a href=https://are.na/bianca-aguilar>Are.na</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
