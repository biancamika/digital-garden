<a href=https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-2/money-speech/#magic-internet-meaning rel=noopener>one and the same thing</a> in 2009, but we have yet to attend to this central question: <em>how can we best use it?</em></p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;A record if it is to be useful to science, must be <strong>continuously extended</strong>, it must be <strong>stored</strong>, and above all it must be <strong>consulted.</strong>&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>Section 4:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;[Our technology must allow users] to <strong>free their brains</strong> for something more than repetitive detailed transformations in accordance with established rules [&mldr;] A mathematician is not one who can readily manipulate figures [&mldr;] S/he is primarily an individual who is skilled in the use of symbolic logic on a high plane, capable of intuitive judgment in the choice of the manipulative processes employed.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>Section 5 begins with the manipulation of logical processes beyond arithmetic and then dives into the final and most critical part the human record: <strong>consultation.</strong></p><a href=#selecting-the-trail><h3 id=selecting-the-trail><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Selecting the trail</h3></a><blockquote><p>&ldquo;We can enormously extend the record; yet even in its present bulk we can hardly consult it. This [&mldr;] involves the entire process by which man profits by his inheritance of acquired knowledge. The prime action of use is <strong>selection</strong>, and here we are halting indeed [&mldr;] Our ineptitude in getting at the record is largely caused by the artificiality of systems of indexing.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;[Instead of alphanumeric indices] the human mind [&mldr;] operates by ==association==. With one item in its grasp, it snaps instantly to the next that is suggested by the association of thoughts, in accordance with some intricate web of trails carried by the cells of the brain.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>Bush introduces the ==&ldquo;memex&rdquo;== - a supplement to memory which pulls together microfilm, recording technologies, and associative selection. It won&rsquo;t be as fast or flexible as the brain, but it could at least improve the clarity and permanence of our recall.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;This is the essential feature of the memex. The process of tying two items together is the important thing [&mldr;] Thereafter, at any time, when one of these items is in view, the other can be instantly recalled merely by tapping a button below the corresponding code space.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>Bush is really talking about ==building &ldquo;user trails&rdquo; through these associative indices.== In much the same way that one book is the associative trail of a mind moving through and selecting certain information; Bush has designed a machine to build trails of trails. These trails ==could also be shared:== my trail passed into your memex and vice versa - a far more efficient and less lossy means of collaboration than simply recommending a book or two.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Wholly new forms of encyclopedias will appear, ready made with a mesh of associative trails running through them, ready to be dropped into the memex and there amplified [&mldr;] There is a new profession of trail blazers, those who find delight in the task of establishing useful trails through the enormous mass of the common record.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>Bush then spends some time speculating on technologies which directly manipulate the human nervous system. He ends with this:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;[Science] may yet allow us truly to encompass the great record and to grow in wisdom. We may perish in conflict before we learn to wield that record for our true good. Yet, in the application of science to our needs and desires, it would seem to be a singularly unfortunate stage at which to terminate the process, or to lose hope as to the outcome.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>The most critical aspect of useful shared records, and the one we are worst at is <strong>consultation</strong>. This requires that we improve at <strong>selection</strong> when working with information.</p><a href=#the-mnemonic-medium><h3 id=the-mnemonic-medium><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>The mnemonic medium</h3></a><p>==Media for thought are all around us==: Bush cites the abacus which, through the positional display of number relationships it implies, led the Arabs to the concept of 0. ==Media for thought create powerful immersive contexts in which to explore new classes of ideas which were formerly impossible.== Matuschak and Nielsen take this much, much further.</p><blockquote><p>💡 If our media help us remember what matters, we may find our minds are already free.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Alan Kay summed up the optimism of this dream when he wrote of the potential of the personal computer: &rsquo;the very use of it would actually change the thought patterns of an entire civilization&rsquo; [&mldr;] for better and worse, computers have affected the thought patterns of our civilization over the past 60 years, and those changes seem like just the beginning.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>Media for thought, like the abacus - or like money and writing - create ==powerful immersive contexts== (which can change the ==thought patterns== of civilizations).</p><p>Leveraging the insights of cognitive science, we can create media that make it effortless to remember what you&rsquo;ve read. The medium builds in the key steps involved in memory. In this context, it means adopting ==highly specialized flash cards== in an essay, and ==spaced repetition (SRM) reminders== after reading. These may sound trivial, but it takes advantage of a fundamental fact about human memory: ==as we are repeatedly tested on a question, our memory of the answer gets stronger, and we are likely to retain it for longer.==</p><p>Why all this focus on memory, though? Will building mnemonic media really free our thought? Remember, Bush showed how new media free our brains from rote tasks: mathematicians are not calculators, but people skilled at intuitively grasping higher order logic.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Memory systems can be extraordinarily helpful for mastering abstract, conceptual knowledge [&mldr;] <strong>because of the way the mnemonic medium embeds spaced repetition inside a narrative.</strong> That narrative embedding makes it possible for context and understanding to build up.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>The key in all this is how you craft the cards: the idea being to make a ==scalable <em>memory laboratory</em>== which can answer some very deep questions about human memory, how it might be improved and practiced, and what impact it can have on our thought and learning.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;We’ll see that memory systems are a small part of a much bigger picture [&mldr;] Seriously developing memory systems is likely to lead to one or more transformative tools for thought.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><a href=#network-structures-for-knowledge><h3 id=network-structures-for-knowledge><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Network structures for knowledge</h3></a><p>Critically, memory systems need to ensure that people don&rsquo;t just learn surface features; they need to help users in innovative ways when they do forget; and they need to encode stories into the mnemonic medium. In this sense, you can see the mnemonic media as ==carrying two texts: the actual one and the reflected one==, built up by all the knowledge encoded in cards.</p><p>However, it is a mistake to think &ldquo;good memory system == spaced repetition&rdquo;. There is also ==elaborative encoding== and the sort of ==associative trail==s Bush was talking about; and techniques like
<a href=https://www.ourmachine.net/writing/memory-i/ rel=noopener>the method of loci</a>, though this isn&rsquo;t as useful for remembering abstract, conceptual knowledge. Seeing this broader perspective allows us to ask much deeper questions, like:</p><blockquote><p>💡 What is the ideal network structure of knowledge?</p></blockquote><p>And what does memory have to do with <em>understanding</em> and <em>creativity</em>?</p><p>Conceptual mastery and creativity is actually enabled by a mastery of details. By largely automating away the problem of memory, ==the mnemonic medium makes it easier for people to spend more time focusing on other parts of learning, making the awkward early stages easier to get through.== The link between memory and mastery goes much deeper though, right down to the idea of <strong>chunking</strong>, as demonstrated with chess masters in the 1970&rsquo;s.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Players learn to recognize somewhere between 25,000 and 100,000 <strong>patterns of chess pieces.</strong> These much more elaborate &lsquo;chunks&rsquo; are combinations of pieces that the players <strong>perceive as a unity</strong>, and are able to reason about at a higher level of abstraction than the individual pieces [&mldr;] Memory is, in fact, a central part of cognition.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>My sense is that having <strong>transportable user trails</strong>, like Bush imagined in &lsquo;45, would be extremely useful. How to make this wealth of knowledge easily shareable? Just encode them as

Well, because:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;The creation of language – the ur tool for thought – is perhaps the most important occurrence of humanity’s existence [&mldr;] Similarly, the invention of other tools for thought – writing, the printing press, and so on – are among our greatest ever breakthroughs.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>What will new tools for thought <em>really</em> look like? Our contention is that protocols for money are exactly one such tool and - given that money preceded writing - they are also an ur tool.</p><p>&ldquo;If we could communicate the experience in an essay, then the tools would be failing at their job; they would not be <strong>transforming</strong> a person’s thinking, or even their <strong>consciousness</strong>.&rdquo;</p><a href=#executable-books><h3 id=executable-books><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Executable books</h3></a><blockquote><p>&ldquo;<strong>Scaffolded exploration</strong>: a way to build up your own understanding, and perhaps even push the frontiers of knowledge.
