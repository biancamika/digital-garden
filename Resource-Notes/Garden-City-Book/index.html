It flat out says we were created to rule — to make something of God’s world.<ul><li>LOCATION: Page 21</li></ul></li><li>your work is a core part of your humanness. You are made in the image of a work- ing God. God is king over the world, and you’re a king, a queen — royalty — ruling on his behalf. Gathering up the creation’s praise and somehow pushing it back to God himself.<ul><li>LOCATION: Page 35</li></ul></li><li>But in a Genesis -shaped worldview — all of life is worship.<ul><li>LOCATION: Page 42</li></ul></li><li>work is “rearranging the raw material of God’s cre- ation in such a way that it helps the world in general, and people in particular, thrive and flourish.”<ul><li>LOCATION: Page 44</li></ul></li><li>Good culture is the result of even better people hard at work, rearranging the raw stuff of Planet Earth into a place of delight.<ul><li>LOCATION: Page 44</li></ul></li><li>creation was a project , not a product.<ul><li>LOCATION: Page 45</li></ul></li><li>You are a modern day Adam or Eve. This world is what’s left of the Garden. And your job is to take all the raw materials that are spread out in front of you, to work it , to take care of it , to rule , to subdue , to wrestle, to fight, to explore, and to take the creation project forward as an act of service and worship to the God who made you.<ul><li>LOCATION: Page 47</li></ul></li><li>The word vocatio can also be translated voice . Man, that says a lot. Your vocation is your voice.<ul><li>LOCATION: Page 52</li></ul></li><li>Calling isn’t something you choose , like who you marry or what house you buy or what car you buy; it’s something you unearth. You excavate. You dig out. And you discover.<ul><li>LOCATION: Page 52</li></ul></li><li>Because in a Hebrew worldview, all of life is spiritual.<ul><li>LOCATION: Page 69</li></ul></li><li>All the word ministry means is “service.” ⁸ Your ministry is your service — it’s the part you play, the slot you fill, the place you do your thing to work for a Garden-like world.<ul><li>LOCATION: Page 73</li></ul></li><li>The idea behind kavod is God’s significance . He’s weighty, as in important . There’s something about this God that we need to stand in awe of. And all through the Scriptures, God’s glory is about two things: Presence and beauty.<ul><li>LOCATION: Page 83</li></ul></li><li>God’s kavod here isn’t his fame; it’s his presence — the fact that he was there , not far away, but close. Heav- en and earth were wed, if only for a moment. And it’s his beauty — this staggering sense of how good he really is.<ul><li>LOCATION: Page 84</li></ul></li><li>Our job is to make the invisible God visible — to mirror and mimic what he is like to the world. We can glorify God by doing our work in such a way that we make the invisible God visible by what we do and how we do it.<ul><li>LOCATION: Page 87</li></ul></li><li>When we see the world in the shape that God intended, the way it’s supposed to be, God gets glory, without a word .<ul><li>LOCATION: Page 89</li></ul></li><li>As people made in God’s image, we can join him in this ongoing creative work. As his partners, we can re- shape the raw materials of his world in such a way that people see the beauty behind the beauty.<ul><li>LOCATION: Page 88</li></ul></li><li>God is a lavish, opulent, extravagant artist , and creation is his beauty on display.<ul><li>LOCATION: Page 89</li></ul></li><li>As people made in his image — all work is artistic. All work is inherently creative. All work — from painting to parenting — is reshaping the raw materials of Planet Earth in such a way that it’s how God intended, how it’s supposed to be, all so humans can thrive as they see God’s glory.<ul><li>LOCATION: Page 91</li></ul></li><li>We are fractured and pulled in a thousand different directions. ADHD, stress, workaholism, burnout, connectivity — these are just words we come up with to name a world that is unraveling at the seams.<ul><li>LOCATION: Page 97</li></ul></li><li>Discipleship is about learning how to become a good human being. And how to live into both your callings, to make disciples and to create culture.<ul><li>LOCATION: Page 99</li></ul></li><li>To focus, we need to know what we’re called by God to do, and what we’re not called to do.<ul><li>LOCATION: Page 103</li></ul></li><li>To borrow from the language of Jesus, you gotta figure what the “work the Father gave you to do” is. And then you need to learn the art of saying no. To good things . A smart man once said, “Good is the enemy of best.” ¹⁷<ul><li>LOCATION: Page 106</li></ul></li><li>A genuine, authentic love of excellence isn’t rooted in greed or narcissism or materialism — that’s dualism talking. It’s rooted in love , for God and others. A desire to serve God and his world well.<ul><li>LOCATION: Page 107</li></ul></li><li>Dorothy Sayers, this spunky, rebellious British writer from half a century ago, said that the best way to serve others with our work is to “serve the work.”<ul><li>LOCATION: Page 108</li></ul></li><li>So we all have gifts, but we don’t all have the same dosage of grace. Some of us have more; others have less. And that’s okay. Your job isn’t to be the best in your field, just the best version of yourself.<ul><li>LOCATION: Page 108</li></ul></li><li>Do one thing. And do one thing well . And do that one thing well as an act of service and love for the world and to the glory of God.<ul><li>LOCATION: Page 111</li></ul></li><li>If you’re really good at whatever it is you do, you don’t need to tell the rest of us. We’ll know. Beautiful things don’t ask for attention.<ul><li>LOCATION: Page 112</li></ul></li><li>“Good design is putting our best forward; it is working hard to bring beauty into the world. When I see something that is brilliant it wrecks me in the best sort of way. I am also constantly returning to this idea that we were created with the ability to create and that makes our God the most generous of all. I’m humbled after I complete every new project, and as I stand there with a big silly grin on my face, I feel his presence and ap- proval.”<ul><li>LOCATION: Page 112</li></ul></li><li>My point is that as human beings, we have this slant to look to our work for significance we can only find in God. When we uncouple our work from God, work becomes a sort of god in and of itself.<ul><li>LOCATION: Page 120</li></ul></li><li>Because the curse drives us to God. If it weren’t for the curses — on both the family and the field — we would look to whatever it is we do for work or rest, and we would find it . And nothing could be more disastrous for the world than God’s image bear- ers finding identity and belonging and even satisfaction apart from him.<ul><li>LOCATION: Page 128</li></ul></li><li>Sabbath isn’t just a day to not work ; it’s a day to delight in what one Hebrew poet called “the work of our hands.” ³ To delight in the life you’ve carved out in partnership with God, to delight in the world around you, and to delight in God himself. Sabbath is a day to pull up a chair, sink into it, look back over the work of the last six days, and just enjoy .<ul><li>LOCATION: Page 134</li></ul></li><li>The Sabbath has a life-giving ability to procreate — to fill the world up with life.<ul><li>LOCATION: Page 136</li></ul></li><li>But rest refills us — with energy, creativity, vision, strength, optimism, buoy- ancy, clarity, and hope. Rest is life-giving.<ul><li>LOCATION: Page 136</li></ul></li><li>It’s a day for rest, and it’s a day for worship. When I Sabbath, I run everything through this grid — is this rest? Is this worship? If the answer to both questions is yes, then I delight in it; if the answer is no, then I hold off until the next day. Because the Sabbath is not the same thing as a day off.<ul><li>LOCATION: Page 138</li></ul></li><li>These are the signs of a life without rest.<ul><li>LOCATION: Page 140</li></ul></li><li>The point is that there is a way the Creator set the creation up to thrive. A way that God set you up to thrive. And when we Sabbath, we tap into God’s rhythm for human flourishing.<ul><li>LOCATION: Page 141</li></ul></li><li>The Sabbath is a day to embrace this reality, to let it sink in, to own it, to celebrate it. To celebrate our weak- ness, our mortality, our limits . To celebrate our God of strength and immortality and limitless power. To rest with him and to rest in him.<ul><li>LOCATION: Page 142</li></ul></li><li>Everything we enjoy costs something. And if it doesn’t cost us, it costs someone else.<ul><li>LOCATION: Page 149</li></ul></li><li>The Sabbath is about leaving Egypt behind. About emancipation from Pharaoh’s suffocating rule. It’s about freedom.<ul><li>LOCATION: Page 150</li></ul></li><li>It’s a way to remember and never forget that what we’re craving, and even coveting, isn’t found in the world of space, but in the world of time — in God himself.<ul><li>LOCATION: Page 155</li></ul></li><li>The Sabbath is more of an art form than a list of dos and don’ts.<ul><li>LOCATION: Page 160</li></ul></li><li>the Sabbath is a day for healing.<ul><li>LOCATION: Page 163</li></ul></li><li>Jesus is the embodiment of the Sabbath. He’s the seventh day in flesh and blood.
