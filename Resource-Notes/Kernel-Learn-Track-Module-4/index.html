The law would never be able to give sufficient details to regulate a commons. A typical tree on the commons of a village has by custom very different uses for different people. The widows may take the dry branches for burning. The children may collect the twigs, and the pastor gets the flowers when it flowers, and the nuts from it are assigned to the village poor, and the shadow may be for the shepherds who come through, except on Sundays, when the Council is held in the shadow of the tree.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The concept of the commons is not that of a resource; a commons comes from a totally different way of being in the world where it is not production which counts, but bodily, physical use according to rules that are established by custom, which never recognizes equality of all subjects because different people follow different customs. <strong>Their differences can be recognized in the way they share the commons.</strong></p></blockquote><a href=#week-4-firesides><h3 id=week-4-firesides><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Week 4 Firesides</h3></a><ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijmmKr-ZjsU" rel=noopener>Andy Tudhope</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtNvB6D2Emw" rel=noopener>Mariano Conti</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djQhzNA9bzc" rel=noopener>Dandelion Mane</a></li></ul><a href=#govern-yourself><h2 id=govern-yourself><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Govern Yourself</h2></a><p>People think governance is hard.

To make optimal collective decisions, the funding principle underlying the market must be ==nonlinear==. This means that it subsidizes <strong>small contributions.</strong>
