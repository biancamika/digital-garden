They are pragmatists. They want to solve problems and make life as comfortable as possible. Material concerns predominate, and people can become quite individualistic.</li><li>==Fourth generation:== feels that society has lost its vitality and begins to question the values they have inherited, some becoming quite cynical. A crisis of sorts emerges.</li></ol></li><li>These narratives, despite being criticized as oversimplistic and borderline manipulative, are like ==prisms== through which we can gain the necessary ==understanding to act urgently in response to the environment.==</li><li>Product-zeitgeist fit: when a product ==resonates== with the mood of the times. These can be determined with the following tests:<ul><li>==&ldquo;Nerd Heat&rdquo;:== When the most talented, hardest working, and most in-demand people—the product managers, engineers, and data scientists—are so intrigued by a product that they&rsquo;re working on it, excited by it, and trying to make it a thing.</li><li>==The &ldquo;Despite Test&rdquo;:== When people are using a product despite the fact that it&rsquo;s not the best thing out there.</li><li>==The &ldquo;T-shirt Test&rdquo;:== If people with no connection to the company are wearing their t-shirts or putting their stickers on their laptops or wearing their socks, that desire to associate with the idea indicates as much a movement as a product.</li><li>==The &ldquo;Eyebrow Test&rdquo;:== In the early days, things that have product zeitgeist fit often feel misunderstood or controversial. At first blush, the conceit may even raise a few eyebrows.</li></ul></li><li>As a student, there used to only be three possible courses of action when you don&rsquo;t know the answer to a question:<ol><li>Admit you don&rsquo;t know the answer.</li><li>Pretend you know the answer even if you know you don&rsquo;t.</li><li>Imitate someone who seems to know the answer even if you can&rsquo;t be sure they do.</li></ol></li><li>But Vaughn Tan argues that with technology, now there is a fourth viable option: ==external memory systems== (e.g. search engines). These make ==learning into ritual and that technology now disguises ritual as actual learning.== In other words, I can easily &ldquo;appear smart&rdquo; on a subject by a series of Google searches and Wiki page hopping without really understanding neither the answer nor the question.</li><li>==Extrapolation:== to compartmentalize your thoughts and actions you need to close them before you move on to another task. It&rsquo;s simple to implement. I ask myself a few questions to extrapolate what I need to take away before I move on to the next task:<ul><li>What did I learn?</li><li>Why is that useful for me?</li><li>How / when will I use this?</li></ul></li></ul><a href=#vol-44-the-pixel-making-of-an-american-dream><h3 id=vol-44-the-pixel-making-of-an-american-dream><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Vol. 44: The pixel making of an American Dream</h3></a><ul><li><em>&ldquo;Software is not only eating the world but cannibalistically eating itself&rdquo;</em> - Can Duruk</li><li>To ponder about ==automation==: Have we enabled creativity by reducing barriers of creation or accelerated its demise by abstracting away the lessons that we get to learn from facing the messy complexity of reality?</li><li>The way language is being spoken, permeated, and interpreted has been changed with new media of transmission.

We feel a compulsive need to remain busy, clinging to a jam-packed schedule that ensures we don’t have to confront the scary thoughts.
