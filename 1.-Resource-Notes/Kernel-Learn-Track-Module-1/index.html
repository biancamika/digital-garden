Every act itself a meditation.== May Li talks about it in terms of turning the living of life into an artwork. The question is, what is the primary means we have a making art of our lives? This course will contend that it is <em>designing dialogue.</em></p><p><strong>In an empire of lies, telling the truth is a revolutionary act. In a fearful society; ==love and trust are the primary tools of resistance.==</strong></p><p>==Play allows us to create and share ownership of spaces in ways which competition cannot.== This is why we have unicorns and dancing developers and silly memes: it&rsquo;s not something incidental. It is a fundamental part of what borderless, global history-writing based on consensus is about. The revolution is not being televised because it&rsquo;s not about hate or anger or violence or anything else that grabs the headlines of a media operating with skewed incentives. It&rsquo;s ==heart to heart==, here in the prison yards where we&rsquo;re using matching funds to build playgrounds where we can love again.</p><p>TL;DR: <strong>True play allows us to&mldr;</strong> subvert the status quo. Have as much fun as possible along the way. Turn life into a canvas, rather than a graph with checkpoints. Welcome everyone. Eat great food. Enjoy dominoes again.</p><a href=#small-things><h3 id=small-things><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Small things</h3></a><blockquote><p>==&ldquo;When you do these little, joyful subversions remember that they can be really small.

At that time, there wasn&rsquo;t a lot of pink happening at all [laughs] It makes me happy to think I got Steve Jobs to approve this while pink hearts were coming out his head. Another example is the Technics 1200 turntables as your avatar - iconic in hip hop - and some other Easter eggs which are still in MacOS.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>May Li goes on to talk about Scribble Together and her approach to presentation. One of the examples she uses is the ability to &ldquo;stamp multiple unicorns&rdquo;. ==Everything is connected.==</p><a href=#experiment-with-format><h3 id=experiment-with-format><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Experiment with format</h3></a><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Another thing you can do is experiment with format [&mldr;] For instance, using this traditional talk format to instead make everyone dance [&mldr;] Another one is subverting technology. This one is pretty profound. We talk a lot about the epidemic of loneliness [&mldr;] somehow, we have accepted the fact that computation has to be locked behind these little rectangles [&mldr;] ==How many years are we into the journey of computers and yet we still accept that we can get locked into things like this!?== What would happen if we turned computers inside out? There&rsquo;s an organization called DynamicLand which does exactly this. ==It&rsquo;s like cooking or scrapbooking; except it&rsquo;s all software and we&rsquo;re building things together."==</p></blockquote><p>It&rsquo;s worth knowing a little bit about
<a href=https://tinyurl.com/worriedream rel=noopener>Bret Victor</a> and the work him and people like him are doing on computation as a concept and practice, rather than just writing more software in a linear, boxed-in kind of way.

There were a couple of reasons I was attracted to it: one of them was that they are a not-for-profit which is building software, and that&rsquo;s pretty rare. I thought, &lsquo;hmmm, what would happen if our <strong>incentive</strong> structures were a little different?&rsquo; I wanted to democratize learning too, so the <strong>mission</strong> was really profound for me. And the last thing was about the <strong>culture</strong>, because I felt that the organization was really open to some experimentation with cultural shifts.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;We wanted to shift educational software from assessing students and just asking &lsquo;Do you get it yet?&rsquo; to letting them explore magical worlds themselves where, for instance, understanding the mathematics would give you powers [&mldr;] And all kinds of interesting stuff fell out of it: visual and interactive properties of prime numbers and so on.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;People tend to have a very vivid imagination when they work in design: you actually, literally, have the tools and you&rsquo;re constantly drawing possible futures. ==When you are iterating, you are literally drawing multiple possible futures.== So, if you take a second and think about something that you want to change, and you look around you - there are so many potential co-conspirators here! - this is really an invitation to you to make some friends and start some shit and joyfully subvert the status quo!&rdquo;</p></blockquote></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li>No backlinks found</li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://garden.bianca.digital/js/graph.abd4bc2af3869a96524d7d23b76152c7.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by Bianca Aguilar using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, © 2022</p><ul><li><a href=https://garden.bianca.digital>Home</a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/biancamikaila>Twitter</a></li><li><a href=https://are.na/bianca-aguilar>Are.na</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
