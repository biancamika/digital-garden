Although there is much to be said and learned about assessment design, in this course, we will limit ourselves to the bare minimum and will focus on understanding the different types of assessments and how they can be more closely aligned with your learning objectives. As imagery, we will refer to assessments as &ldquo;evidences of learning&rdquo;¬†üîç, and refer to the saying</p></blockquote><p><img src="/images/Pasted image 20221002212659.png" width=auto></p><blockquote><p>After all, as we learned in Hirst, learning will always be the goal of good teaching.¬†==<em>What are different types of evidence that we can have students produce?

As each step is presented below, I invite you to simulate it with the lesson you are designing.</p><ol><li>üéØ¬†<strong>STEP 1: Retrieve your ==learning objectives</strong>==¬†-¬†_What is the &ldquo;change&rdquo; you want to see?<ol><li>Well written learning objectives make it easier for you to actually come up with the assessment for it. Sometimes the objectives themselves begin to describe the actual assessment to be done.</li><li>For example, in my media and technology course, one of my learning objectives are as follows: &ldquo;Students should be able to curate and create media¬†<strong>(behavior)</strong>¬†to aid in teaching a particular subject matter¬†<strong>(condition)</strong>, abiding by instructional design principles¬†<strong>(criterion)</strong>&rdquo; - in this case, the main task for my actual assessment is already my learning objective.</li><li>If your learning objectives currently do not &ldquo;spell out&rdquo; what the assessment will be like yet, that&rsquo;s okay! We&rsquo;ll do that in STEP 2.</li></ol></li><li>üñºÔ∏è¬†¬†<strong>STEP 2: Choose the ==form==</strong>¬†-¬†<em>How can I &ldquo;see&rdquo; the learning objective?</em>¬†<em>What is the most appropriate evidence that students can produce in their context?</em><ol><li>After reviewing your objective, the next step is to envision it being attained in the context of your learner. This is where the level of your learning objective comes into play-remember Bloom&rsquo;s taxonomy?</li><li><strong>ASSESSING HIGHER LEVEL OBJECTIVES</strong>¬†through¬†<strong>AUTHENTIC ASSESSMENTS</strong><ol><li>If your learning objective is stated on the higher levels (ex. analyze, evaluate, create), you will probably want to design authentic assessments. ==Authentic assessments approximate the¬†<strong>application</strong>¬†of the knowledge/skills you want students to attain and use in a real-life context.== When you look at the verbs under these higher order learning objectives, they describe activities that involve more complex thinking, a mix of skills and decision making. It usually involves the creation of a product, the conduct of a performance, or a set of justified decisions that students will need to make given a realistic situation/scenario.</li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zvFNR8WL3g" rel=noopener>Assessing What Matters Most: Developing Authentic Performance Tasks</a><ol><li>Apply and use in meaningful ways</li><li>Teachnig is like coachnig</li><li>Work to improve</li><li>Teachers as coaches</li><li>Teaching for understanding and transfer</li></ol></li><li>The tricky part is what we identify as &ldquo;authentic&rdquo; - and ==the answer to this cannot be removed from the context of your students.== What might be an authentic scenario for a college student might be different for a grade school student (you actually already started to think about this - remember our previous exercise where I asked you to think about the long-term goal for your subject?).</li><li>One of my favorite examples to illustrate this is the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E86-RJe7mfA" rel=noopener>TV show Masterchef</a>! What makes Masterchef authentic?<ol><li>Apart from them really doing the actual cooking, and not just participating in a quiz bee about cooking, the challenges presented call for an application of their cooking skills in realistic scenarios - and one characteristic of a realistic scenario is that it&rsquo;s &ldquo;Messy&rdquo; - it can be sometimes unpredictable, there is¬†no one right answer,¬†and it often involves more¬†complex decision making. These are the same ingredientes (pun intended) that make up an authentic assessment.</li><li>Let&rsquo;s use another example - let&rsquo;s say you are teaching basic addition to a grade 1 student. It&rsquo;s great if students can count aloud from 1-20 and could answer a number of drills you throw at them, but wouldn&rsquo;t it be more authentic if they could actually use their math skills to help their parents compute the grocery, or to figure out how to save up for a toy that they want to buy?</li></ol></li></ol></li><li>Authentic assessments¬†<strong>aim for APPLICATION NOW not just APPLICATION LATER</strong>.<ol><li>I remember asking a few teachers before about why we needed to learn what they were asking us to learn about, and more often than not the answer I got was &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll use it in the future!&rdquo; For a grade school kid, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll use it it in the future&rdquo; did not sound like a compelling reason to study the subject matter - but just the same, I studied to get an A on a test, and to just forget it immediately after. Is this an experience you can relate to as well? If your answer is yes, your teacher came from an ==&ldquo;Application later&rdquo; paradigm== - they believed that students just need to &ldquo;get through school&rdquo; - anyway, they will find good use for what they have learned &ldquo;later on&rdquo;. The problem with this, as the example illustrates, is ==the lack of relevance that students feel, and that more often than not, the learning that happens is just good for passing a test.==</li><li>In an authentic assessment we design ways to approximate the real life applications of what you aim for them to learn. So, how do we come up with these situations. One helpful tool is called the GRASPS model.<ol><li><strong>G</strong>oal ‚Äî challenge or problem</li><li><strong>R</strong>ole or Responsibility</li><li><strong>A</strong>udience</li><li><strong>S</strong>ituation or Scenario</li><li><strong>P</strong>roduct or Performance</li><li><strong>S</strong>tandards ‚Äî Expectations</li></ol></li></ol></li></ol></li><li><strong>Reminder:</strong>¬†At this point, you may be thinking that authentic assessments should always be a project. The answer is: No. ==What makes it authentic is the task, not the format!== This means that a paper and pen essay could be authentic, if the situation set-up follows GRASPS.<ol><li><em>Ex. In a persuasive writing class for college students, an authentic written assessment might sound like this: You have been in charge of a new national committee called the COMELEC Youth (Role). Your goal is to convince young people like you to vote wisely in the upcoming 2022 Philippine Presidential Elections (Goal). As part of your role, you have been asked to give a 20 minute speech to 1000 young leaders from all over the Philippines (Audience), in the opening convention (Situation). Write a compelling script (Product, Standards-assuming what makes something compelling has been learned in this class) for this speech.</em></li></ol></li></ol><blockquote><p>Come up with a possible authentic assessment for the learning objective you thought of in the previous exercise.
