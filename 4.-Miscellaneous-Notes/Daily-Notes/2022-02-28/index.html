And anything you do for society you do for yourself also. That insight is very powerfully made in the practice of no-self.</p><p>I think one of the most wonderful books that Martin Luther King wrote was <em>Strength to Love</em>. I always liked it because of the word “strength,” which counters the Western notion of love as easy. Instead, Martin Luther King said that ==you must have courage to love, that you have to have a profound will to do what is right to love, that it does not come easy.==</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>We may think that justice is everyone being equal, having the same rights, sharing the same kind of advantages, but maybe we have not had the chance to look at the nature of justice in terms of no-self. That kind of justice is based on the idea of self, but it may be very interesting to ==explore justice in terms of no-self.==</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Sometimes in life all things are not equal, so what does it mean to have justice when there is no equality? A parent can be just towards a child, even though they’re not equal.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Justice is possible without equality, I believe, because of compassion and understanding. If I have compassion, then if I have more than you, which is unequal, I will still do the just thing by you.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>You want to be human. Be angry, it’s okay. But not to practice is not okay. To be angry, that is very human. And to learn how to smile at your anger and make peace with your anger is very nice. That is the whole thing—the meaning of the practice, of the learning. ==By taking a look at your anger it can be transformed into the kind of energy that you need—understanding and compassion. It is with negative energy that you can make the positive energy.== A flower, although beautiful, will become compost someday, but if you know how to transform the compost back into the flower, then you don’t have to worry. ==You don’t have to worry about your anger because you know how to handle it—to embrace, to recognize, and to transform it.== So this is what is possible.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>We oppress ourselves by holding on to anger. My students tell me, we don’t want to love! We’re tired of being loving! And I say to them, ==if you’re tired of being loving, then you haven’t really been loving, because when you are loving you have more strength.== As you were telling us yesterday, we grow stronger in the act of loving.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>==Fear is born from ignorance.== We think that the other person is trying to take away something from us. But if we look deeply, we see that the desire of the other person is exactly our own desire—to have peace, to be able to have a chance to live. So if you realize that the other person is a human being too, and you have exactly the same kind of spiritual path, and then the two can become good practitioners. This appears to be practical for both.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>==The only answer to fear is more understanding.== And there is no understanding if there is no effort to look more deeply to see what is there in our heart and in the heart of the other person. The Buddha always reminds us that our afflictions, including our fear and our desiring, are born from our ignorance. That is why in order to dissipate fear, we have to remove wrong perception.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>They need community to remind them. Sometimes you have a flash of insight, but it’s not strong enough to survive. Therefore in the practice of Buddhism, ==<em>samadhi</em> is the power to maintain insight alive in every moment, so that every speech, every word, every act will bear the nature of that insight.== It is a question of cleaning. And you clean better if you are surrounded by sangha—those who are practicing exactly the same.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>I think that ==we best realize love in community.==</p></blockquote><a href=#outline><h6 id=outline><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Outline</h6></a><ol><li>Point that struck me the most: the difference between sacrifice and self-sacrifice<ol><li>Got this from the circular norm, which states that a relationship can only be genuinely loving if it results in the growth of both persons</li><li>Why is it important?<ol><li>It shows me that love requires courage.
