### Philosophies of Education
*_First, we will look unpack the role of philosophy in education, to set-up the framework by which you will view the 3 different philosophies. Then you will explore 3 different philosophies and reflect on the decisions and actions that they might influence in educational settings._

#### The 3 Big Words of Philosophy
- **What is education philosophy for?** One of the best ways to really dig deep into this question is to unpack what it is. 
- Here's a short excerpt from an article from Oregeon State University ([https://oregonstate.edu/instruct/ed416/PP1.html](https://oregonstate.edu/instruct/ed416/PP1.html)). While reading the excerpt below, be aware of your "head nod moments" - or parts where you find yourself agreeing - since most probably you have the same views, or your "head shaking moments" - or parts that go against your current beliefs or views.

> Philosophy means "love of wisdom." It is made up of two Greek words, philo, meaning love, and sophos, meaning wisdom. Philosophy helps teachers to reflect on key issues and concepts in education, usually through such questions as: What is being educated? What is the good life? What is knowledge? What is the nature of learning? And What is teaching? Philosophers think about the ==meaning of things== and ==interpretation of that meaning.== Even simple statements, such as "What should be learned? Or What is adolescence?" set up raging debates that can have major implications. For example, what happens if an adolescent commits a serious crime? One interpretation may hide another. If such a young person is treated as an adult criminal, what does it say about justice, childhood, and the like? Or if the adolescent is treated as a child, what does it say about society's views on crime?
> 
> Your educational philosophy is ==your belief about why, what and how you teach, whom you teach, and about the nature of learning.== It is a set of principles that guides professional action through the events and issues teachers face daily. Sources for your educational philosophy are your life experiences, your values, the environment in which you live, interactions with others and awareness of philosophical approaches. Learning about the branches of philosophy, philosophical world views, and different educational philosophies and theories will help you to determine and shape your own educational philosophy, combined with these other aspects.
> 
> ==When you examine a philosophy different from your own, it helps you to "wrestle" with your own thinking.== Sometimes this means you may change your mind. Other times, it may strengthen your viewpoint; or, you may be eclectic, selecting what seems best from different philosophies. But in eclecticism, there is a danger of sloppy and inconsistent thinking, especially if you borrow a bit of one philosophy and stir in some of another. If serious thought has gone into selection of strategies, theories, or philosophies, this is less problematic. For example, you may determine that you have to vary your approach depending on the particular learning needs and styles of a given student. At various time periods, one philosophical framework may become favored over another. For example, the Progressive movement led to quite different approaches in education in the 1930s. But there is always danger in one "best or only" philosophy. In a pluralistic society, a variety of views are needed.

- I remember one of the first days from a class in my graduate studies class, where a teacher of mine asked us, "Why do you want to learn about education philosophy?" Of course, a lot of us, albeit already being teachers ourselves, were a bit dumbfounded, but I still remember how our teacher answered that question. She said, **"We study philosophy and education, so that we can have a ==common language== and we can ==build on each other's ideas== in our profession".** 
- This made a lot of sense - we study the history and philosophies of education because ==if we have this shared knowledge, we can begin to understand each other's perspectives and we can build on each other's ideas.== Hopefully throughout the course, you've felt like we've been doing some education =="vocabulary building".==
- Education Philosophies provide us with vocabulary to answer three fundamental questions:
	- **What is the nature of Reality (Metaphysics):** ==Often, ones perception about reality affects the aims, concerns and curriculum of a particular kind of education.== Is reality mental or spiritual? Is it objective, existing outside our minds? Is it based on our experience?  Do we construct our own reality? 
	- **What is the nature of Knowledge? (Epistemology):** This second question is about one's belief about knowledge - is knowledge something discovered from reality? or from universal truths that we discover through thinking and discourse? Is knowledge (truth) intuitive, subjective or personal? Is knowledge (truth) revealed from God in a sacred or holy book?  Is knowledge (truth) revealed from reasoning? Is knowledge (truth) empirical, constructed by using our sense and the scientific method? ==Often, our perspective about knowledge affects our methods of instruction.== 
	- **What is the nature of Values? (Axiology):** This third question is quite interesting, because it reminds us that when we look at education history, it's never just been about a transfer of knowledge and skills, but ultimately also about ==behavior and attitudes.== Recall how education in the historical era's we've covered aimed to form a certain kind of educated person. This third question examines ==what is right and wrong; good and evil.==  Are the ethical standards of behavior, objective and universal?  Are ethics subjective? (personal likes and dislikes) Are ethics culturally relative, depending on cultural norms at a given time?
- These three questions often form the building blocks of the "isms" or education philosophies we will study. Pause and think about your own answers to these three questions. Give yourself permission to be a Philosopher in the next few minutes of this module. 

#### Your 3 big words
##### Prompt
Let's begin the process of building towards your own teaching philosophy. Answer the 3 questions below:
1. What is reality for you? Based on this, what is important to be learned? (Metaphysics)
2.  What do you believe about knowledge? (Epistemology)
3. What do you think are values and behavior that need to be taught to everyone? (Axiology)

##### Answer
###### Outline
- Metaphysics
	- [[Modernism]], [[Metamodernism]]
	- We construct our own reality...this is made more prevalent in the post-truth era
- Epistemology
	- I believe that knowledge is empirical
	- But I also believe in an intuitive/personal perspective
- Axiology
	- Morals are universal...for instance human dignity
	- But ethics? Can be subjective
