## Highlights
- Question: What technologies of today can we use to understand our own con- cerns of a climate future analogous to the way pre-historic humans drew their conceptions onto the cave? 
- HUMAN ENOUGH uses machine learning-generated visions of climate futures (Stable Dif- fusion, Midjourney, etc) and climate adaptions / potential solutions (ChatGPT) in a creative space (Gather) to reconstruct a modern analog of the age-old cave painting.
- The outcome is a collective imagining of our climate future and our adaptions to it from a technological and material perspective.
- Workshop Process:
	- Researchers first briefed participants (See https://raylc.org/teaching)
	- First, participants were asked to generate an image that portrays a certain scenario (e.g. a world with constant bouts of heat waves and fire natural disasters). They were learning how to tailor the prompts to get purposeful and aesthetic results.
		- Perhaps I need to use a card deck to help come up with prompts (maybe Building Utopias? Or the Transhumanist one?)
	- Then the participants asked ChatGPT the potential human solutions to these future disaster scenarios, learning to write prompts in such a way as to yield in-depth, speculative, and specific answers.
	- Then they took the answers provided by ChatGPT and ask text-to-image (e.g. Stable Diffusion 1.4) to again visualize the human adaptation scenarios.
	- Finally, they were asked to adapt these visualizations into action- able designs of objects or artifacts that would illustrate this design concept in the speculative scenario given.
		- Perhaps I as the researcher can do this, translating ideas into refined product design formâ€¦
		- Also responsible for putting things into a narrative, putting this into an exhibition experience
	- How can I analyze the participants viewpoints?
		- Perhaps through semi-structured interviews?
		- Then thematic analysis
