title: "CHI Paper MOC"
---
## Overview
- Basically like my thesis (See [[Atlas/Projects/Thesis]]) but with a different methodology
	- Thesis: researches creates AI art 
	- CHI Paper: participants create AI art
- Goal: Full paper submission to CHI 25? and/or WIP paper submission to CHI 24

## Inspiration

## Ideas
- Workshop where participants create AI art based on the following prompt: **"Imagine a day in the life in 2040 for the Filipino"?**
	- base idea...you're essentially exploring the use of AI tools to envision the future...how does the AI influence their perceptions?
- Must educate participants beforehand (e.g. how to write good prompts)
- maybe involve not just have them do AI art, but AI writing as well

## Questions
- Logistics of running a workshop or a sprint, especially in a remote setting
- tackling AI in an ethical way?

## Notes: 7/17/23
- better if participants write the prompts kasi
- kailangan mo igeneralize...don't evaluate usability of chatgpt....evaluating usecases of AI tools for this context (envisioning the futures)
- Pros and Cons
	- sprint: prepared paper methodology, defined na
	- workshop: faster 
	- diary study: 
	- ^ kailangan ng justification, prepared
	- ^ write research protocol, expected outputs, present possibilities to Jordan
		- define participants and their background...should they have experience? 
		- get at least 5 participants...masyadong marami na ang 10
- Ethical Limitations
	- participant recruitment: consent, recruitment
	- no problem with AI
	- ^ you can make this part of the workshop, their perception on AI...dapat related siya sa main topic
- based on the results of the workshop...this is what we think...and this is how it relates to greater literature 
- identify positioning of paper and how it contributes to the greater literature
	- HCI contributions: empirical, artifact
- expected outputs:
	- prompts won't be very valuable
	- "how do they envision the future"?
	- now that we have AI genertation tools, what future do they see based on the tools?
- another consideration: technical set-up
	- set up discord server for the participants, connected to Richard's computer, Midjourney
		- just use one discord account, and send multiple prompts (for video)
	- issue: Stable Diffusion is pretty resource intensive
	- Dall-E: not good quality
- "what if we use generative AI tools to enhance the D&D storytelling experience?"
- take exact same 1 week into the future workshop....
	- don't draw...generate with AI tools
	- if you follow structure, you can ask them to generate multiple images
- do workshop parts in FigJam open session or Miro
- Timelines
	- If you want to aim for CHI 24: late breaking work (like preprints or posters) January 25, 2024
		- pwede siyang remote
		- considered semi-archival, which means you can reuse your paper in the next CHI (if you're going to make it a full paper)
	- you need to have not just research done, but also have the paper written 
		- paper length: 8 pages long, excluding references, double column format
	- You should be done with the workshop by October
		- you can do this within the next 2 months, just figure out logistics
		- Recommendation: Do it ASAP! by middle of first semester
		- email Maam Nikki so that you can get clearance pa
			- CHI paper is small part of thesis (the research part), you have to ask for permission on this
			- the rest of the process is the thesis na your creative work
- make research participants background more specific
	- "They self-identify..."
	- how many years of experience?
	- for students, they should probably come from specific majors 
	- pre-filter survey

## Action Items
- Figure out research protocol, explore other concepts (e.g. sprint), then send feedback to Jordan
	- ask about sensemaking
	- talk 1-2 sentences about the intersection's results
	- you can start interviewing experts
- Once it's clear, execute, then observe
	- You need at least 2-3 hours for the workshop
	- think about compensation
		- or explicitly state that it will be voluntary
- Write your research questions
	- this will be part of your contributions

- [ ] Write email to Ma'am Nikki talking about collaboration and asking for meeting / Zoom call 
	- [ ] Ask Jordan + Richard to check before sending
- [ ] Write about desired research protocol, put in presentation and ask for feedback from Jordan
- [ ] Write out your research questions

## Research Protocol
### Project Overview 
**Title of Project:** 
**Keywords:** Generative AI, Design Futuring, Speculative Design, 

#### Background and Current Approaches

#### Rationale and Objectives
### Research Questions 
1. In what ways does AI support the generation of ideas for an utopian future for youth in developing countries?
2. What are utopian and dystopian futures typically imagined by youth in developing countries, and what role does technology play in these?
3. How might design fictions as a method of futuring elicit new ideas that speak to concepts of a utopian reality for youth in developing countries?

Notes:
- maybe replace AI with AI art generators? unless ChatGPT will also be used
