## The NoMA Method
- NoMa: note-making
- sharpens your thinking, gives you intellectual assets
- What most of us are not doing: externalizing our ideas...this is what we want to improve on
- Note-taking
	- quickly captured
	- other people's thoughts
	- FOMO mentality
	- easy in, easy out
- Note-making
	- mindfully made 
	- your words
	- active
	- JOMO
	- mindfully in, mindfully out
- Note-making is the act of investing in yourself.
	- It gives you linkable assets, which can easily become intellectual assets.
- Sometimes it's clear why you're note-making...but just as often, it's not clear. You feel the spark and you want to go towards that.
- NoMa: a way to make insights in minutes last a lifetime
- How to NoMa (related to [[Permanent Notes/ACE Thought-Weaving Framework]])
	- Be a "thing finder": notice anythjing; "Hmm..."
	- Connect... "That reminds me of..."
	- "Because..."
- How to build these assets? Make a note and link it
- "The best time to plant an idea is yesterday. The next best time to plant is now."
- The more general, the more difficult for topics
- Make a **connection** to form an **expression**
	- Which resonate: synthesize, shape, develop, assemble
