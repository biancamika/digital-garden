- Food to package: 
	- Lucky Me! Filipino pancit canton (stir-fried noodles)
		- The Lucky Me! logo visually sends the signal of the brand’s ==care== for its consumers. A graceful circle runs around the “Lucky Me!” text to give a feeling of a ==warm embrace from a good friend.== The waft connotes the ==pleasant aroma== and ==freshness== of the meal ahead. It triggers ==happy memories of light, bonding moments== – of sitting around, sharing life, and eating together over fantastic, flavorful, and fuss-free meals.
		-  Amber is a resin from tree sap which is golden brown in color. For the Chinese, this Amber resin is considered ==lucky.==
	- OR batchoy or sotanghon?
	- NVM I'll be going with fish na lang...
		- https://www.packaginginnovation.com/product-packaging/make-splash-next-fish-packaging-design/
			- add more style
			- extra information (e.g. information about the fishfarm, feature a different recipe, highlight health benefits)
- Filipino packaging:
	- Old ideas
		- warmer color palette?
		- made for big serving
		- Biodegradable packaging
			- cardboard boxes?
			- alternatives to aluminum foil: leaves? or cloth?

				- Here in the Philippines, a lack of appropriate pulp sources makes paper products expensive while an abundance of discarded synthetic materials contributes to enormous landfills and constantly clogged sewers in urban areas. As alternatives, I've encountered all-natural packaging that require nothing more than access to ==local trees, a bit of hand crafting and the occasional machete.==
				- coconut palm, nipa woven containers, 
			- OR PALAYOK? Filipino clay pot
				-  It is great for making native Filipino soups and stews such as Kare-kare, and its beautiful rustic black finish which together with a woven bamboo ring known as a **[Dikin](https://ancientcookware.com/philippines/bamboo-woven-ring-detail)** (sold separately) makes for a great presentation for family style service. 
				- The round shape is better suited for gas ranges or open fire as the flames travels up the sides and evenly distributes the heat.
				- I can make this handpainted pa
				- Related: Hampas-Palayok game
			- comes with extra toppings (make it look like Amber pancit)
		- Locally, it is a staple dish in any celebration meal especially birthdays because long noodles mean long life.
	- OR Reused ice cream container LOL

	- Japanese packaging is super transparent...and straightforward...just showcase the dish with a mascot pa
		- taiyaki inspired
		- make it kawaii or wahtever
		- _Tai_ are considered a symbol of luck and fortune in Japan, and were an expensive fish only affordable by the higher classes or on special occasions. Masamori Kobe, the fourth owner of the store, stated that Seijirō wanted to give the ordinary people a taste of the expensive fish at low prices.
	- Vacuum-sealed pouches are practical, but boring
