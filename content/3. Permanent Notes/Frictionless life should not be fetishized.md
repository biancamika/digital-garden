## Notes
> The fetishized life without friction: What was it like? An unending shuttle between meetings and bodily needs? A continuous, productive loop? Charts and data sets. It wasnâ€™t, to me, an aspiration. It was not a prize.
- Hedonistic view
- Suffering is what make life worth it; without it, we can't  grow
