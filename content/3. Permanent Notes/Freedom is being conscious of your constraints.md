## Notes
+ Freedom is defined by its opposite: limitations
+ Freedom = **Awareness + acceptance**
	+ Embracing boundaries > denying them
+ We can define what boundaries we choose
	+ We can't operate without boundaries
+ Lived freedom is the **conscious navigation of responsibility**
	+ E.G. Laws, ethics whatever
