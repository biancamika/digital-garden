## Notes
In discussing the usefulness of different types of sources, we will use the BEAM method, developed by Joseph Bizup. BEAM stands for: Background, Exhibit, Argument, Method.
-   **Background**: using a source to provide ==general information to explain the topic.== For example, the use of a Wikipedia page on the Pledge of Allegiance to explain the relevant court cases and changes the Pledge has undergone.
-   **Exhibit**: using a source as ==evidence or examples to analyze.== For a literature paper, this would be a poem you are analyzing. For a history paper, a historical document you are analyzing. For a sociology paper, it might be the data from a study.
-   **Argument**: using a source to ==engage its argument.== For example, you might use an editorial from the New York Times on the value of higher education to refute in your own paper.
-   **Method**: using a source’s way of ==analyzing an issue to apply to your own issue.== For example, you might use a study’s methods, definitions, or conclusions on gentrification in Chicago to apply to your own neighborhood in New York City.
