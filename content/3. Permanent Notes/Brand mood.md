## Notes
 - can simply be defined as a brand's essence, which is captured through both the ==abstract (e.g. values, beliefs) and the concrete (e.g. aesthetics, people)==
 - a brand either has it or it doesn't
> Brand mood is its aesthetic universe, ideas, values, beliefs, music, the energy of people and places, the crowd it gathers and the crowd that gathers around it.
