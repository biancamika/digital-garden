## Notes
### What is problem-based learning?
From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem-based_learning):
> Problem-based learning is a student-centered pedagogy in which students learn about a subject through the experience of ==solving an open-ended problem== found in trigger material.
### How does it work?
+ It works best when:
	+ problems are part of larger, ideally real-world tasks
	+ learners are supported to take ownership of the problem
	+ the task is appropriate to the learner's level of understaning and ability
	+ the learner must reflect on what is being learned and how they learned it
	+ the educator encourages the learner to test their ideas in various contexts
+ **[[3. Permanent Notes/Teachers are facilitators]]:** Teachers act as facilitators to help students achieve their own learning goals
