## Notes
- > The goal isnâ€™t to maximize your social media numbers. The goal is to be known to the smallest viable audience.
- **Definition:** the smallest possible market you can serve and that can sustain your business as it grows. It's about targeting the people who will particularly benefit from what you are offering
