## Notes
### What is Constructionism?
+ Constructionism is a pedagogical approach that centers context, situated knowledge, and learning by doing.
+ It has two central concepts:
	+ Learning is a ==reconstruction==
		+ Instead of a transmission of knowledge, which is [[3. Permanent Notes/Banking model of education]]
	+ Learning is most effective when part of an activity the learner experiences as constructing a meaningful product.
		+ According to Piaget, learning is ==experiential==: it takes place through an active process where the learner develops the ability to modify or transform an object or idea.”
+ Summarized in 2 principles (according to Resnick):
	+ "People do not get ideas, they make them"
	+ "People construct new knowledge with particular effectiveness when they are engaged in constructing personally meaningful products"


### Thoughts
+ We must think about others always...(thank you [[3. Permanent Notes/Design justice]])
	+ Everything we learn reflects the learnings of our teachers
	+ We can better understand the world by building a shared consciousnes

> although it is beautiful to think about how nothing is truly done, learnt or built alone, ==we must always consider who and what we are (re)constructing with. ==

> If learning is a reconstruction of knowledge, then ==everything we learn reflects the learnings of the people we’re told to listen to== unless we choose to do otherwise.

> By seeking out diverse voices and learning together, we can build ==shared consciousness== and better understand the world and the predicaments that plague us.
