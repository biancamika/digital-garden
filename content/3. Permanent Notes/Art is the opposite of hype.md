## Notes
- This is because at its core, it's a ==critique== of the surrounding industry and world.

> Art is social and cultural critique, a constant questioning of what’s going on in the industry and in the world, exploring and preserving one’s independence while doing so. Putting something in a museum doesn’t make it art.
