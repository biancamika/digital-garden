## Notes
- puts together what has been broken apart; locates it in the bigger scheme of things
- E.g. experiences:
	- boy makes me feel special by paying attention to me
	- figuring out why I dislike a person
	- feeling of peace after resolving a personal crisis
	- warm feeling of belonging when I'm surrounded by family
- In these moments: 
	- feel a strong sense of SELF
	- but cannot capture and describe in same degree that I capture my gender and religion
	- Di ko lubusang mahawakan pero ramdam na ramdam ko ang pagka-AKO
	- Tumitingkad ang pagka-AKO sa pakikipagkapwa-tao
	- I-subject emerges ONLY in relation to others
- So what is the total I?
	- *Secondary reflection:* I am the I that emerges in my many relations with others ==(Communion)==
