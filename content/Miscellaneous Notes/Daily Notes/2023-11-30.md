### Module 6: **Citizenship**
#### Filipino Perspectives and the Idea of Pro-Active Citizenship
- Diokno (1997) points out, however, that the community referred to also includes the local community, as Filipinos in general struggle with **“identifying with an abstraction such as the nation”** (20).
	- We don't have a nationalist identity....
	- A continuing challenge then for Filipino citizenship is that of balancing ==being part of the nation-state== and being part of their ==respective local communities.==
- On good citizenship: **"The typical image of a good citizen is the tax-paying citizen, the honest voter, the driver who obeys traffic rules (a rarity nowadays).  But a good citizen is also one who ==asserts his or her rights, speaks out in defense of the voiceless, respects the environment, treats women and men equally,== and so on” (20)."**
	- It's not just about following rules! What if the rules you follow aren't intended for good? But for keeping you in order
- Filipino citizenship is construed in terms **“of processes by which citizens ==negotiate the nature and extent of their rights== as individuals and their obligations to the community”** (19-20).
	- Citizenship then is understood in the context of processes of deliberation.
	- In the context of democratic governance, citizenship “is the very base of collective action, a shared vision, the means to a sustainable future, and the link to generations of citizens yet unborn”
- Pro-active practices of citizenship consist of...
	- **“==indigenous, day-to-day== practices of democracy and decision-making in communities where formal government mechanisms and elected officials may or may not exist”** (Diokno, 1997: 20-21).  
		- In so far as communities can sort things out by themselves through truly deliberative mechanisms—whether formal or informal—pro-active citizenship is practiced
	- **“initiatives taken by ==organized== groups or sectors who engage in ==formal== democratic processes, to also explore other venues of expression and alternative solutions”** (21)
- Aside from governance at the local level, Naga City is an example of the practice and process of pro-active citizenship.
- Effective citizenship is a **two-way street.**
	- On the one hand, the **government** should ==exercise the rule of law==, and make itself ==accountable to the public==, “which involves not only merely taking responsibility for one’s acts but [also] conducting oneself according to democratic ways and beliefs” (21).
		- More crucially, the government should “ensure that the ==social requisites for the practice of democracy are present:== a decent standard of living, employment, education, health and other services, and access to opportunity for improvement and a better life” (Diokno, 1997: 21).
		- It is established knowledge that people who are hungry and poor, and who have limited prospects for a better life would be too busy to concern themselves with concerns greater than their own, thus limiting opportunities for the effective exercise of citizenship.
	- On the other hand, **citizens** ==“need to perform their obligations and exercise their rights” in  a collective manner== if they are to stand a chance in transforming institutions and structures that have repeatedly limited their capacities for a better life (Diokno, 1997: 21).
		- **Organization** is key in the politics of development.
		- Citizens acting ‘in concert’, Diokno (1997) further notes, “can map out and implement their plans, negotiate with other entities including government, and apply pressure, when necessary, to bring about the desired change” (21).

#### Seeking Leadership and Accountability
- A crucial insight we can glean from the discussion of Diokno (1997) on effective, pro-active citizenship is that **effective leadership is a crucial capability.**
	- People’s participation is a function of ==organization== and an ==enabling environment,== coupled with ==“the existence of functional leaders and members”== (27).
	- Oftentimes effective citizenship is ==hindered by government itself==, as it “infrequently appears as a role model of positive values” (26), as and in a lot of ways “have proved to be unreliable or unstable agents for promoting responsible citizenship and democracy” (27).
- We are all familiar with a notion of leadership that emphasizes individual character and capability.  
	- So familiar are we to this notion that can easily name exemplars of leadership, as well as name the qualities that make them such fitting examples.  This is indeed a valid way of looking at the concept of leadership.  
	- Politically speaking, however, ==there is more to leadership than sheer individual effort.==
- Bolden (2011) discusses how leadership can be understood not only as an individual pursuit, nor only about the structure or design of a system, but also as **a social process involving other agents.**  This is the main idea of **distributed leadership.**
- Citing Uhl-Bien (2006), Bolden (2011) propounds that distributed leadership is “a collective social process emerging through interactions of multiple actors” (251).  
	- Leadership is construed as “as group activity that works through and within relationships, rather than individual action” (Bennett _et.al._, 2003: 3 cited in Bolden, 2011: 252).  
	- The practice of leadership then is “a product of the interactions of…_leaders_, _followers_, and aspects of their _situation_” (Spillane and Diamond, 2007: 7 cited in Bolden, 2011: 252 Emphases in original).
- This notion of distributed leadership is politically salient in two ways.  First, distributed leadership is construed as a social process, as a function of interactions and relationships between and among people and/or organizations.  This resonates with how we defined politics in module 1: Politics is the process of people negotiating scarce resources involving relationships of power (Cf. Kerkvliet 2013, Leftwich 2011).  Leadership is political.
- Second, distributed leadership is not simply a matter of technical design.  In fact, there are a variety of ways by which leadership can be distributed, as presented in Table 2 of Bolden’s (2011) essay.  
	- More crucially, Bolden (2011) notes that “‘distributing’ leadership _per se_ is not necessarily beneficial, but that what is important is _how_ leadership is distributed” (259 Emphases in original).  
	- The question on the manner of distribution of leadership inevitably raises the questions on the reasons for distributing leadership, on the agents/organizations controlling or managing the distribution, and the other matters being distributed.  
	- Bolden (2011) as such points out that the implementation of [distributed leadership] cannot be considered politically neutral.  It is motivated by a series of expectations, assumptions and agendas which, while a face value may appear reasonable enough, may actually serve to legitimize and reinforce the domination of particular individuals and groups over others (260).
- The state responses to the pandemic (both here and abroad) are usually couched in terms of leadership.  Inadequate responses easily lend itself to the belief that the leadership is inadequate.  While that might be true in most instances, the questions should not only focus on what the leader/s lacked in terms of knowledge, skills, and attitudes.  In the context of distributed leadership, it is also important to look at the processes, interactions, and relationships that hinder (or facilitate) adequate responses to the pandemic.

#### Towards Collective Action
- Citizenship is not just a matter of entitlements and obligations defined by law.  Citizenship is ==an active practice of participating in the public life==, no matter how small such participation is.  
	- More than an exercise of rights and duties, citizenship is also “the very base of collective action, a shared vision, the means to a sustainable future, and the link to generations of citizens yet unborn” (Diokno, 1997: 22).
- However, how do we turn collective action into palpable, lasting change?  Eric Liu (2016) asks essentially the same question: ["Eric Liu: How to turn protest into powerful change"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_g1BMVFcuw). Here are three core strategies are involved.
	- First, **expand the frame of the possible**.  
		- The first battle is waged not necessarily on physical spaces (public parks, streets), but on the ==spaces of the civic imagination.==  
		- As Liu (2016) emphasizes, ==asking the ‘what if’ question,== “and not taking as given all the givens of conventional politics” is the important first step.  
		- However, expanding the frame of the possible needs some level of concreteness, otherwise what is being imagined becomes simply impossible.
	- This leads to the second step: **choose a defining fight**.  
		- More than trying to answer the question on that which you want to fight for, this step is about defining the boundaries of the fight.  
		- ==“Powerful citizens set the terms of [the] contrast”== between an ‘us’ and a ‘them’, which is the fundamental characteristic of politics.  
		- This distinction, however, must always be _agonistic_ in that parties involved in the debate still respect each other’s humanity and rights, eschewing primarily the resort to violence.
	- The third and last step is **finding an early win.**  
		- Liu (2016) emphasizes that such win, “even if it’s not as ambitious as the ultimate goal, ==creates momentum, which changes what people think is possible==”.  
		- The important thing to remember, however, is that what eventually would lead to palpable, lasting change is “[n]ot the single triumph, but ==the long, slow slog==”.  Early wins set in motion the grind necessary for changes to happen, and to be sustained.
- A concrete example is the story of McKenna Pope: ["McKenna Pope: Want to be an activist? Start with your toys"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTK_cJVryIc#action=share)
	- Obviously, you live in a context different from Pope’s, and you might not have the same resources as she has.  More blatantly, her problems might not be your problems.  You might not even be the kind of person who goes to rallies.  It does not matter.  As Liu (2016) notes: **“You just have to be a participant, and to live like a citizen”.**  And if I may add, there is always “time to fight for a cause greater than ourselves”.
