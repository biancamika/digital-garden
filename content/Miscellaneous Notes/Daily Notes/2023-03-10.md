#### Work and Mental Health
- Work stress and **economic outcomes:**
	- Chronic diseases
	- Lower productivity
	- Workplace injuries
- We usually think of stress as an individual outcome. But [[Stress is a culture]]. 
- What should be changed?
	- **Corporate culture:** work expectations, wellness programs, social circles
		- (Insert picture of flow axis)
	- **Government investment:** spending on health, employment, etc.
	- **Individuals:** self-mastery and commitment
- We have a culture have glamorized stress, busyness, lack of mental health
- Prioritize your sleep; you can transform your life one night at a time

	- Everyone has an individual piece, but nothing brought them together. (Like the Blind Men and the Elephant)
	- Working in **silos**
- Think about the organizations you are part of. What systems are there that prevent flourishing and mental health?
