> Technology is closely related to very popular and positive imaginaries (Progress, Modernity, Science). This is why we tend to consider technology a good thing or, at least, a neutral thing.

> we therefore ask what are the sociotechnical imaginaries of VR? How do these sociotechnical imaginaries frame the future(s) of VR? And finally, what kind of world views do these imaginaries bring about? In using sociotechnical imaginaries as a lens, we reveal how the future is framed within the market thus stymieing any real alternatives to the current ideological order of late capitalism and furthermore, how VR, as a case study of emergent technology, serves to invisibilise the power asymmetries which are required for that order.

> Similarly, speculative design aims to shape people's visions of possible futures and mobilize affect in order to construct alternative futures imagined by the designers. Speculative design can thus contest, create, and enact sociotechnical imaginaries [[96](https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3313831.3376515#bib96)]. Just as sociotechnical imaginaries can be used to look both to the future and the past, we can similarly use speculative design to re-orient toward the past.

> I spend a lot of time talking about futures. I'm a firm believer, like some of your earlier speakers, that the world essentially runs on narratives. It runs on stories, particularly stories about the future.
> At the World Economic Forum, I led the work on [The Fourth Industrial Revolution](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/01/the-fourth-industrial-revolution-what-it-means-and-how-to-respond/), focusing on how emerging technologies could disrupt industries, labour markets, societies and governments, and how technology can be used to empower communities to create a human-centred future. The story about this was very consciously related to the idea of values, and credited to this idea of technology as a public good. We tried to create a [socio-technological imaginary](http://sts.hks.harvard.edu/research/platforms/imaginaries/imaginaries-faqs/) by articulating an entire narrative and way of talking about the subject.

> The imaginaries mentioned by Söderström et al. refer to “storytelling ideological constructs,” mostly used by corporations like Google (Shaw and Graham [2017](https://link.springer.com.oca.rizal.library.remotexs.co/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-94-024-1202-4_23-1#ref-CR91 "Shaw J, Graham M (2017), to convey a positive discourse of social prosperity and technological advancement. But also, are appropriated and re-signified by lay citizens in the process of co-producing the city (Estrada-Grajales et al. [2018](https://link.springer.com.oca.rizal.library.remotexs.co/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-94-024-1202-4_23-1#ref-CR28 "Estrada-Grajales C, Foth M, Mitchell P (2018)). What we posit here is that the design, production, and use of current technologies, materialized in software, media contents, mobile devices, and ubiquitous data producers, effectively shape in various ways how urban residents experience the city (Gordon and de Souza e Silva [2011](https://link.springer.com.oca.rizal.library.remotexs.co/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-94-024-1202-4_23-1#ref-CR45 "Gordon E, de Souza e Silva A (2011) Net locality: why location matters in a networked world. Wiley, Chichester")). One of the major repercussions is the ability of those citizens to produce and hack information about their own urban environment (Foth et al. [2015](https://link.springer.com.oca.rizal.library.remotexs.co/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-94-024-1202-4_23-1#ref-CR36 "Foth M, Brynskov M, Ojala T (eds) (2015) Citizen’s right to the digital city: urban interfaces, activism, and placemaking. Springer, Singapore"); Goodchild [2007](https://link.springer.com.oca.rizal.library.remotexs.co/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-94-024-1202-4_23-1#ref-CR43 "Goodchild MF (2007) Citizens as sensors: the world of volunteered geography. GeoJournal 69(4):211–221")). In other words, facilitated by the technologies present in the so-called algorithmic culture, urban residents can become city co-producers who are imagining, communicating, and shaping the city they desire.

> Evocative imaginaries of the digital have been flourishing parallel with very prosaic, everyday actions of users by screens, keyboards, and other interfaces. Imaginaries definitely offer potential for cultural analysis, even if they are ever imperfect, provisional, and mutable. This chapter explains how imaginaries evoking ungraspable and enchanting dimensions of digitisation have been related to everyday practice and the mundane. It briefly outlines the concept of imaginaries in a way useful for cultural analysis and empirical studies of digitisation. The chapter introduce the concept of mundanisation, in order to explain how technological systems, at times imagined as ungraspable, enchanting, and sublime are transmuted into the commonplace while being enmeshed in people's everyday practices. Mundanisation is the process through which the ungraspable is ignored and how imaginary frontiers are overlooked. The chapter also discusses the interplay between evocation of imaginaries and mundanisation with illustrations that explains the relationship between imaginaries, mundanisation, and digitisation.

> The legitimacy of business education and its impact on society have been debated in the context of the economic and climate crises, with curricula, learning spaces and pedagogy being the main targets of criticism. Somehow, the COVID-19 pandemic has increased that pressure and added social inequalities to the debate. Thus, this paper proposes an exercise of imagining what management education and society will be like in 2050. Using speculative imagination, we narrate three imaginaries - Techno Futurist, Sustained [Inequalities](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/inequality "Learn more about Inequalities from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") and Eco-utopia - built upon the perspective of the students of a sustainability programme at an elite Brazilian business school. Throughout the construction of the imaginaries' narratives, we found dilemmas and contradictions that alert us that there is no clear path to an emancipatory future and that, unfortunately, the tendency is to reproduce neoliberal ideology and managerialism. Furthermore, the lack of diversity of teachers and students, a direct consequence of business schools’ admission and funding, can hinder new imaginaries. We conclude by inviting business schools to include imagination as a critical exercise for students, so that they can organise outside of “business as usual”, open up alternative futures, and cope with the uncertainties that surround us.
