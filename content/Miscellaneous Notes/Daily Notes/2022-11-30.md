### Feedback
- character creation process
	- likes the segmented process
	- likes the prefilled options
	- good to have text and voice
	- what if they want to edit the image directly?
		- DALL-E inpainting
	- ideally 3D but will be open to 2D

- Character chat
	- character is actually talking
	- more like facetime/video call
	- the environment matches the setting/the story (determined from the story)
		- from initial prompt/custom instruction
		- can change over the course of the story
	- could be user-generated or preset adventure
	- like an improv game
	- multiplayer
	- keep the invite screen
	- image generation
	- end story sequence
		- end story button
		- have it show up in a dashboard for them
			- you've done this story, this is your character
			- what is the dashboard they see when they login and logout
			- i've done 4 stories with these characters, and I accomplish them
			- characters + stories they've done
		- if the user is in screen, they can be filtered as their character?
			- E.G. snap filters
			- E.G. full body ai
