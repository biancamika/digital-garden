## Research  
### Ideas
- Study
	- Collect data then make speculative design from it
	- How to do ethnography digitally? 
	- Maybe through Interviews and field observations?
		- Engineers imaginaries were studied in a similar way
	- Or foresight research (a.k.a. semi-structured interviews with experts) supplemented with desk research
		- As seen in postcards from the future 
		- Con: would require a specific focus already (future of work perhaps? Something labor related)
- Co-design/participatory design
	- Workshop
		- Option 1: researcher generates the art 
			- Given a prompt, they write down descriptions of how they’d envision the future 
			- researcher puts their descriptions in a text to image generator (may have bias though)
			- They are interviewed about it?
		- Option 2: Teach them how to AI art
			- Then give them a prompt that makes them envision the future
			- Maybe they also go through a workbook
			- Analyze their responses
	- Sprint
		- Follow 1 week in the future method, but with AI tools?
		- Decide if group setting or if working 1:1 with people
		- Co-speculating with sketches and prototypes
		- Maybe the interactive workbook can be made on Figma? So that it’s easy to edit?
		- Process:
			- Ideation
			- Storyboarding
			- Sketching? (Planning out your prompts before you try them out)
			- Prompt Engineering
			- Sharing

### Protocol
- Goals and Objectives
	- Write your research questions
		- I want to uncover imaginaries
		- Then visualize them
- Subject recruitment criteria
- Methods
- Contributions
	- Types: Empirical and Artifact
	- Ideas: 
		- Empirical data from mixed method study
		- Critical analysis on Filipino technologists’ perceptions about the future
		- Design implications in the Philippine tech scene? (In terms of ethics)
#### Thesis
- Option 1: Foresight research + participant feedback
	- Process
		- Pre-study
			- Desk research: collect scientific articles, analyze themes through affinity diagram
			- Semi-structured interviews with experts working on at least 2 themes
			- Postcards created based on concepts identified in interviews
		- Study
			- Workshop setting (pre-launch):
				- 1-2 hours?
				- Ask participants for first thoughts, possible scenarios, and critical issues
				- Feedback here may be used for revision
			- Pop-up setting (post-launch):
				- Viewers can leave a comment on a card? they choose
				- Something like https://pluriverse.world/
		- Content analysis
	- Participant criteria
		- Interview experts only...those who have
	- Ideas
		- Instead of postcards with still images, what if I made short films? Could be as simple as the still image films here: https://anna-zhang.com/mind

- Option 2:  Ethnography
	- Process
		- semi-structured interviews w/ target audience?
		- field observations + informal interviews at events (participating)
