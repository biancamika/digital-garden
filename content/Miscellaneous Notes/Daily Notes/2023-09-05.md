### Politics and Institutions
#### Institutions
- Definitions
	- An established organization or corporation (such as a bank or university), especially of public character
	- A significant practice, relationship, or organization in a society or culture
	- An established law, practice, or custom
- The first discussion for this module must really be about defining **institutions**. The term has been redefined, unpacked, and critiqued so richly that the literature has admittedly become confusing.
- Two categories: formal and informal
	- **Formal institutions** 
		- Normally understood to be ==(written)== laws, regulations, legal agreements, statues, contracts and constitutions — the so-called ==‘parchment institutions’== (Carey, 2000) — which are enforced by third parties,
		- E.G. constitutions, contracts, laws, and forms of government
	- **Informal institutions** 
		- Thought of to be as the ==(usually unwritten)== norms, customary practices, standard operating procedures, routines, conventions and traditions (Hall, 1992) which are ==often deeply embedded in culture and its associated ideology==
		- E.G. traditions, customs, moral values, religious beliefs, and other norms
- The Kaufmann et. al paper focused on how the private sector views red tape and how red tape is reinforced through/by formal and informal institution
	- **“Red tape”** is a perception that governments are too bureaucratic and that governance is too heavily on rules, regulations, and procedures that they become counterproductive, if not a total nuisance
	- The paper looks at how the private sector, like business, react to the ==various interactions between formal and informal institutions==

##### What are Institutions?
- Institutions are best understood as the ==“rules of the game”== (North, 1990) which ==shape human behavior in economic, social, and political life== — Quite simply, human society is impossible without them.
- Effective institutions ==provide for predictable and stable patterns of interaction in all walks of life.== So institutions are thus best thought of as durable social rules and procedure, formal and informal, which structure—but do not determine—the social, economic, and political relations and interactions of those affected

##### Characteristics
- Institutions, as a set of rules, are not self-generating or self-sustaining — and they achieve little on their own. To be effective and sustained, they require ==legitimacy, consistency and compatibility with other institutions, maintenance, implementation, and review.==
- Economic institutions, as with political and social institutions, are ==social and political constructions== and not simply matters of technical design or administrative arrangement.
	- Understanding how institutions are forged, how they evolve, and the conditions which ensure their successful implementation, rather than avoidance or evasion, is therefore fundamental.
- It is therefore the ==interaction of individuals, organizations and institutions== that is at the heart or the politics and political economy of development, where ‘organizations’ are understood to be the formally/informally coordinated vehicles for the promotion or protection of a mix of individual and shared interests and/or ideas
##### Informal Institutions
- Informal institutions guide human behavior and decision-making processes.
- Characterizing informal institutions
	- **Corruption:** higher levels of corruption usually occur in places with more red tape
	- **Political ideology:** more conservative cultures are more critical of government rules and regulations; red tape perceptions tend to be higher in these places
	- **Culture:** collectivist societies are more associated with lower “red tape” perception; higher preference for uncertainty avoidance = preference for more rules and regulations, thus making them less likely to consider these as “red tape”
- 

##### Formal Institutions
- The first hypothesis (H1) is: **“There will be a positive association between ==country-level formalization== and perceptions of red tape in the private sector”**
	- This hypothesis is based on the idea that the more governments formalize processes (or basically create more and more regulations and rules) that the private sector has to follow, the more the private sector will perceive government regulation as undesirable
- The second hypothesis (H2)
- This means that the less effective a government
- The third hypothesis (H3) is: **“There will a positive association between ==federal states== and perceptions of red tape in the private sector”**
	- This means that the private sector is more likely to consider government regulation as undesirable if there is inconsistency in governance across more levels of government (national, state-level, LGU-level, etc.)
- The fourth hypothesis (H4) is: **“There will be a positive association between ==more conservative political ideology== in a country and perceptions of red tape in the private sector”.**
	- This means that the more a political environment prefers conservative ideologies such as market freedom and “smaller governments”, the more likely it is that the private sector is to consider government regulation undesirable.
- The fifth hypothesis (H5) is: **“There is a positive association between ==a country’s level of corruption== and perceptions of red tape.”**
	- This means that the more corrupt a government is in the eyes of the people, the more likely it is that the private sector will look at government regulation as undesirable
- The sixth hypothesis (H6a) is: **“There will be a positive association between the ==levels of individualism in a country== and perceptions of red tape.”**
	- This means that individualist cultures, or those that prefer personal autonomy, right above duties, the promotion of self-reliance and self-fulfillment before collective interests are more likely to look at government regulation as undesirable.
- The seventh hypothesis (H6b) is: **“There will be a *negative* association between ==the level of uncertainty avoidance in a country== and perceptions of red tape in the private sector.”**
	- This means that cultures that have lower levels of uncertainty avoidance are more likely to view government regulation as undesirable. 
	- Uncertainty avoidance is about a culture’s openness to change: the less avoidant a culture is, the more open it is to change.
##### Types of Institutions
Various social and political institutions have very specific functions, logics, and systems. Leftwich and Sen identify three general classifications, within which both formal and informal institutions could be observed:
- **Economic institutions:**
	- They are about the definition, acquisition, distribution, and regulation of economic goods, such as property and services.
	- Formal elements include laws and policies that govern this portfolio of policy issues
	- Informal elements would include gender norms that pertain to rights of property ownership, class systems about access to economic goods, etc.
- **Political institutions:**
	- They are about how power is obtained, used, controlled, and by whom.
	- The formal elements would obviously include forms of government, written constitutions, etc.
	- Informal elements could include cultures of corruption, familial ties, etc.
- **Social institutions:** 
	- They are about society and culture.
	- Formal elements would include governments in their capacity to regulate social relationships/behavior.
	- Informal elements could include matters on social cohesion, inclusion, gender, generations, and religion.

##### Government Regulation
- What do these findings say about government regulation?
	- As a generalization, the private sector forms preferences and perceptions on how effective or ineffective government is based on key formal and informal institutional dynamics.
	- When it comes to formal institutions that constitute what we may call “good governance”, the private sector looks at government regulation more favorably when government is effective in ascertaining rule of law, more efficient in its lawmaking, and more streamlined in its implementation.
	- Informal institutions like cultural depictions of government corruption and political ideology also have been shown to affect perceptions on government regulation
	- The more a culture looks at government as corrupt overall, the more likely do people consider government regulation a nuisance
	- Lastly, the more a government over-regulates, the more conservative cultures become averse to government regulation. The findings of this paper may have resonance for people who are frustrated with contemporary governance issues
##### What are Organizations?
- **Organizations** are the “formally or informally co-ordinated vehicles for the promotion or protection of a mix of individual and shared interests and ideas.”
- If **institutions are the *rules* of the game, organizations are the *players* of the game.** The two terms could be easily confused as synonyms.
- Basically, institutions are the formal and informal rules that govern politics. Organizations are the groups the participate in politics.
- Institutions and Organizations are different but must always be studied and understood as highly related to each other because most social, political, and economic institutions overlap. As a result, how individuals and organizations navigate these institutions becomes a point of necessary inquiry.
##### How do institutions contribute to social and political change?
- Kathryn Sikkink and Martha Finnemore begin their article by explaining the shifts in approaches and assumptions made in the study of politics over the last century. They explain that for most of the 20th century, political science was dominated by an American school of thought that meshed together rationalism and realism.
- With the increases prominence of decolonization and transnational advocacy networks such as the Red Cross and the World Wildlife Fund in the 1970s, the succeeding decades of political science started to take an **“ideational turn”.**
- This entailed explaining politics not just in terms of formal processes (i.e. decision-making, governance modes, elections, red tape, etc.) but also constructivist terms.
- With this “ideational turn” came the implication of legitimacy and ideology in the study of politics In simpler terms, the “ideational turn” encouraged more critical questions about political processes. Instead of merely “what works” in a very functionalist-realist sense, **political scientists started to ask ==“how does change really occur”== in a social constructivist sense.**
	- Social constructivism: a sociological theory of knowledge according to which human development is socially situated, and knowledge is constructed through ==interaction with others.== 
	- Like social [[Constructionism]], social constructivism states that ==people work together to actively construct artifacts.==

###### Norm Life Cycle
With this, Sikkink and Finnemore propose their framework called the Norm “Life Cycle”, which has three stages:
- **Stage 1: Norm Emergence:** the characteristic mechanism of the first stage is persuasion by *norm* entrepreneurs. They attempt to convince a mass of states (or norm leaders) to embrace their own norms.
	- *Norm Entrepreneurs:* norms do not appear out of thin air. They are conceptualized by individuals and groups who have a strong notion of what is appropriate and desirable on their communities. Norms hope to convert society into something the norm entrepreneurs consider ??
		- These entrepreneurs are important from the very beginning because they are the ones who call attention to issues, and they frame issues into a discourse that calls for urgent change
		- The goal is for this message to resonate and capture the imagination of the wider public. ==For norms to effectively cascade, communities must understand and believe in the image and condition of the world that the norms aim to create/protect==
		- In a lot of situations, norm entrepreneurs operate in spaces where other norm entrepreneurs who advocate for opposing ideas and values. The dynamic will look like two or more sides trying to prevent others from winning the public’s preference.
		- This **“normative contestation”** is a very important occurrence because new norms attempt to emerge in  political spaces that already have a saturation of other norms.
		- In simpler terms, ==norm entrepreneurs push for norms in a political space that already has existing standards of what is acceptable, appropriate and desirable.== As such, these new norms they support and fight for hope to change, or even supplant, existing norms.
		- Some normative projects do not succeed in the normative contestations simply because its entrepreneurs were unable to persuade a critical mass of the public that the norms they push for are better and more desirable than currently dominant norms. However, when norm entrepreneurs do succeed, this is called a *tipping point* or *threshold point*.
- **Stage 2: Norm Cascade:** Norm leaders socialize other actors with norm entrepreneurs as an attempt to get them to become norm followers. What encourages other actors to become norm followers? Various reasons that include pressure for conformity, desire to enhance international reputation, desire of leaders (i.e. politicians) to enhance reputation/legacy.
	- The **key actors in the norm cascade process are states** (national governments), **international organizations** like the UN, and **advocacy networks** like Amnesty International. These three actors work for a greater level of formalization of norms and institutions.
	- This process involves a complex dynamic akin to a “contagion”, which Sikkink and Finnemore call **“socialization”**. This **socialization** process involves ==rich and continuous public debates and discussions that aim to recognize actors== like politicians and states that have effectively worked towards the formalization of new norms and institutions, and ==to ridicule actors== who either are failing to uphold these new standards or are refusing to do so. 
	- A primary goal of socialization is **conformity**. Countries, organizations, and networks hope that all their preferred norms reach a level of familiarity in the international community that ==everyone just conforms to the norms.==
	- As Sikkink and Finnermore point out Axelrod’s take, they quote: “By conforming to the actions of those around us, we fulfill a psychological need to be part of a group”.
- **Stage 3: Norm Internalization:** norms acquire a ==“taken-for-granted quality”== and are ==no longer a contentious issue in the public debate.== Examples: women’s suffrage, abolition of slavery, immunity of medical personnel during open conflict/war (i.e. Red Cross, Red Crescent, MSF)
	- When norms cascade to the point that norms simply become “taken-for-granted”, or that they become so integral to how people live their lives that they don’t think about them anymore, norm internalization occurs.
	- Internalized norms could become both powerful because they are no longer questioned, and very ambivalent because they are no longer as critically examined in the mainstream.
	- When norms are ==enshrined in laws, constitutions, and contracts==, they become something for ==compliance==, sometimes thoughtless compliance.
- Question to think about: *Is the universality of human right a norm that still is in the process of cascade, or is it an internalized norm that is now being challenged by new emerging norms?*
###### Internalization of Norms
- **Prominence:** When a state recognizes the effectiveness of some key norms in other prominent and prosperous countries, they are more likely to support the cascade of such norms in their own country
- **Intrinsic characteristics of the norm:** Norms that are ==clear and specific== are more likely to be more effective in reaching internalization. Norms that ==rest on universalistic claims== also tend to become more influential. An example of a norm that meets both characteristics is the universal rejection of slavery as an acceptable and legitimate economic activity.

### Assessment: Designing Evidences of Learning
#### What are Assessments?
- In their handbook for course-based review and assessment, Martha L. A. Stassen et al. define assessment as **“the systematic collection and analysis of information to improve student learning**.” (Stassen et al., 2001, pg. 5)
- Our own Department of Education (2016) has also defined assessments as follows:
	- _**Assessment** is ==the process of measuring learners' progress in the attainment of learning standards and 21st-century skills.== The results of the various forms of assessment shall be used to quantify judgments on learners' academic performance. It is a quality assurance tool to track student progress in the attainment of standards, promote self-reflection and personal accountability for one's learning, and provide a basis for the profiling of student performance._ _Thus, it is an integral part of the teaching-learning experience and provides an opportunity to improve teaching strategies inside the classroom._
- Here are more definitions from literature:
	- All activities teachers use to **help students learn and to gauge student progress** (Black & Williams, 1998)
	- **Provides feedback** on the effectiveness of instruction and gives student a measure of their progress (Jabbarifar, 2009)
	- The systematic **process of documenting and using empirical data**on the knowledge, skills, attitudes and beliefs to refine programs and improve student learning (Allen, 2004)
- Do you notice a pattern in these definitions? Here are the things I noticed:
	- First, assessments should be ==concrete== and ==facts-based.==
	- Second, assessments should be ==useful for both the teacher and the student== - it should be able to provide feedback to the student on how he/she can improve, and it should be able to provide feedback to the teacher on how she/he can improve the learning experiences provided to students.
	- Third, assessments are used to check if students have reached the ==learning outcomes== of the module.
#### Share an Unforgettable Assessment
- DLQ Final presentation about answering a Life Question

One assessment that remains unforgettable for me during my stay so far in Ateneo was my final exam for the Discerning Life Questions. For this exam, all that you needed to do was answer one of your Life Questions in a 10-15 minute presentation to the teacher, using the insights you got from class. It was definitely memorable for many (including me) because this gave us the opportunity to process things we usually swept under the rug; my best friend’s life question was about why she couldn’t forgive her mother, while my life question was about why I had such a toxic relationship with dance. Honestly, the whole process felt like a therapy session: from uncovering deep traumas while outlining my script, to pouring my heart out to my teacher while doing my presentation. It was truly cathartic, and the way my teacher validated me after (i.e. pointing out the good characteristics I couldn’t see amidst my self-hatred) still makes me emotional to this day. I’ll definitely keep DLQ lessons close to my heart for the rest of my life.

#### Purpose of Assessments
- Different types of assessments can help you understand student progress in various ways. 
- In your classroom, assessments generally have one of three purposes: Assessment **_of_** learning, Assessment **_for_** learning, and Assessment _**as**_ learning. If we look at assessment in terms of these these perspectives, we get to understand what assessments are for, and who is it for.
	- **Assessment OF learning:** occurs when teachers use evidence of student learning to make judgements on student achievement against goals and standards
	- **Assessment FOR learning:** occurs when teachers use inferences about student progress to inform their teaching
	- **Assessment AS learning:** occurs when students reflect on and monitor their progress to inform their future learning goals
- Now, look back into your experiences as students. What were the "assessments for learning",  "assessments as learning", and "assessments of learning" implemented by your former teachers? 
- So based on this perspective comes two major types of assessments commonly implemented by teachers in the classroom - ==formative assessments and summative assessments.== What is the difference between the two? Watch this [video]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xb609JC3_QU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xb609JC3_QU)) to learn more.
- Teachers do not need to wait until the end of the lesson to find out if students are having difficulties in understanding the lesson. She/he can use a variety of strategies such as practice exercises, asking questions, etc, which we can collectively call **formative assessments.** Its main purpose is to ==find out if students are on track.== 
- At the end of the lesson, unit, or module, teachers need to collect evidence (such as exit tickets, reflection, or a graded quiz) that students indeed reached the objectives of the lesson, unit, or module. These assessments are called **summative assessments**.
#### Evidence of Learning
- **What type of assessments do I use as evidence of learning?**
- The **[[Understanding by Design]]** framework recommends for teachers to look at the skills and knowledge that the lesson, module or course is striving to develop among its students in terms of curricular priorities:
	- **What is worth being familiar with? What skills and knowledge are important to know and do? And lastly, what [enduring understandings](https://iteachu.uaf.edu/enduring-understandings/) should be developed?**

![[Curricular Priorities.png]]

> **[[Enduring Understandings]] are the insights that a learner gains by doing the work of understanding, i.e. making connections in our learning that help us make sense of and integrate new knowledge into existing understandings. (Wiggins and McTighe, 2003).**

- **After we have identified these curricular priorities,  we choose what type of assessments to use.**
	- What are these performance tasks and projects?

![[Curricular Priorities and Assessment Methods.png]]

#### Performance Tasks
- An evidence of student learning are what we call **performance tasks.**
- **Performance tasks** are _engaging and worthy problems or questions of importance, in which students must use knowledge to fashion performances effectively and creatively. The tasks are either ==replicas or analogous to the kinds of problems faced by adult citizens and consumers or professionals in the field==? (Wiggins, 2010)_
- In their 2005 book, _Understanding by Design_, education scholars, Grant Wiggins and Jay McTighe, advocate for a different approach to assessment that ==delineates between performance tasks assessments and more traditional forms of assessment.== More traditional forms of assessment, or “academic prompts” as Wiggins and McTighe call them:
	- Require students to think critically,
	- Involve analysis, and evaluation,
	- Usually only occur in academic environments.
- While performance task assessments:
	- Attempt to simulate problems and situations that arise in a multitude of work environments not limited to academic environments;
	- Allow students to personalize the required product (a project, performance, etc.) to their own interests and/or learning objectives; and
	- Usually require the student to address an audience other than the instructor.
#### Overview of Test Item Types
- **What are the different types of test items?** There are many assessment types and the assessment type we choose would depend on the curricular priorities.
- Objective test items have two main categories: selected response items and constructed response items.
	- **Selected response test items** already contain the answer and all the student has to do is to select the correct answer
		- Alternative Response
		- Matching Exercises
		- Multiple Choice
	- **Constructed response test items** only gives a prompt, and students are expected to generate their own answer(s)
		- Completion/Supply Items/Short Response
		- Essay

##### **Why do we need to have guidelines in writing tests?**
- Before we move on the specific guidelines, at this point, it is important to ask this question, "Why do we need to have guidelines? Why can't we just go ahead and write the test questions based on what I know as a content expert?"
- The purpose of tests is ==to capture what the students know - if he/she have actually attained the objectives of the unit or course.== 
	- It ensures that the test we create is **valid - The term validity refers to whether or not the test measures what it claims to measure. On a test with high validity the items will be closely linked to the test's intended focus.**  
	- So, if the tests we create is unable to do that, then we cannot assume that the results of the test represent what he/she actually knows. 
	- Several organizations have put forth guidelines and this is collectively called [Universal Test Design](https://www.testpublishers.org/assets/documents/volume%206%20issue%201%20Creating%20%20better%20tests.pdf). You may read the link to find out more.
##### **How do we write acceptable test items?**
From the CONSTRUCTING DIFFERENT TEST ITEM TYPES pdf

1. Suggestions for constructing **alternative response items**:
	1. Avoid broad general statements.
	2. Avoid trivial statements.
	3. Avoid the use of negative statements, and especially double negatives.
	4. Avoid long, complex sentences.
	5. Avoid including 2 ideas in one statement unless cause-effect relationships are being measured.
	6. If opinion is being used, attribute it to some source unless the ability to identify opinion is being 
	specifically measured.
	7. True statements and false statements should be equal in length.
	8. The number of true and false statements should be approximately equal.
2. Suggestions for constructing **matching exercises:**
	1. Use only homogeneous material in a single matching exercise.
	2. Include an unequal amount of responses and premises. Instruct examinees that responses maybe used once, more than once or not at all.
	3. Keep the list of items to match brief. Place the shorter responses on the right.
	4. Arrange the list of responses in logical order.
	5. Indicate the basis for matching the responses and premises.
	6. Place all of the items for one matching exercise on the same page.
3. Suggestions for constructing **multiple-choice items**:
	1. The stem of the item should be meaningful by itself and should present a definite problem.
	2. The stem should include as much of the item as possible and should be free of irrelevant material.
	3. Use a negatively stated item stem only when significant learning outcomes require it.
	4. All of the alternatives should be grammatically consistent with the item stem.
	5. An item should contain only one correct or clearly best answer.
	6. All distracters should be plausible.
	7. Verbal association between the stem and the answer should be avoided.
	8. The relative length of the alternative should not provide a clue to the answer.
	9. Items used to measure understanding should contain some novelty but beware of too much 
	novelty.
	10. The correct/best answer should appear in each alternative position an approximately equal 
	number of times but in random order.
	11. For single-word choices, order the questions alphabetically. For phrases and sentences, try to 
	make the length of the choices the same, and/or arrange them from shortest to longest. 
	12. Use sparingly special alternatives such as “none of the above” or “all of the above”.
	13. Do not use multiple-choice when other item types are more appropriate.
	14. Break any of these when you have a good reason for doing so.
4. Suggestions for constructing **interpretive exercises:**
	1. Select introductory that is in harmony with the objectives of the course.
	2. Introductory should be appropriate to the curricular experience and reading ability of the examinees.
	3. Select introductory material that is new to examinees.
	4. Select introductory material that is brief and meaningful.
	5. Revise introductory material for clarity, conciseness and greater interpretive value.
	6. Construct test items that require analysis and interpretation of introductory material.
	7. Make the number of items roughly proportional to the length of the introductory material.
	8. Observe all suggestions for constructing objective test items.
5. Suggestions for constructing **short response items**:
	1. Word the item so that the answer is both brief and definite.
	2. Do not take items directly from books to use as a basis for short answer items.
	3. A direct question is generally more acceptable than an incomplete statement.
	4. Indicate the type of answer wanted if the answer is to be expressed in numerical units.
	5. Blanks for answers should be equal in length.
	6. Do not use too many blanks.
6. Suggestions for constructing **essay items**:
	1. Ask questions or tasks that will require the examinee to demonstrate a command of essential knowledge.
	2. Ask questions that are determinate, in the sense that experts could agree that one answer is better than another.
	3. Give preference to more specific questions that can be answered more briefly.
	4. Test the question by writing an ideal answer to it.
	5. Avoid optional questions.
	6. Define the task as completely and specifically as possible.
#### Module Summary
- **Teachers use different forms of assessments for different purposes.**
	- We use **diagnostic assessments** to diagnose learning difficulties, **formative assessments** to check student progress, and **summative assessments** to check if students have reached the objectives of the course, lesson or unit.
- **To identify the most appropriate assessments to give to students, we look at objectives and goals of the module, the curricular priorities,**  **identify the evidences we need to be able to judge whether students have reached the goals of the module or lesson.**
	- There is a variety of the assessments methods to use to capture evidence of learning - traditional tests, performance tasks, and  portfolio assessments, to name a few.
