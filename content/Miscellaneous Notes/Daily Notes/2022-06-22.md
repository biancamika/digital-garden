- **epistemic violence:** how knowledge is created, circulated....
	- Why do they need to go to a school? What type of school? 
	- E.G. Christian school v.s. Ati school
- worldview of filmmaker v.s. worldview of central characters
	- watching a documentary allows you to see how film relates with reality
	- the dynamic of those in production or cast
- a lot of what we perceive as real is mediated through media
- cultural capital is privilege...comes from similar circles

- **Imaginary:** the way ordinary people "imagine" their ==social surroundings== â€” and this is often not expressed in theoretical terms, but is carried in ==images, stories, and legends==
- **Social imaginary:** 
	- Our social imaginary at any given time is complex. It incorporates a sense of the normal expectations we have of each other, the kind of ==common understanding== that enables us to carry out the collective practices that make up our social life.
	- This incorporates some sense of how we all fit together in carrying out the common practice. 
	- Such understanding is both ==factual and normative==; that is, we have a sense of how things usually go, but this is interwoven with an idea of how they ought to go, of what missteps would invalidate this practice.
- Seeing v.s. knowing
	- Seeing: How is it that we can: *Not* see? *Not* know? 
	- Knowing: See *but* not know? Know *but* not see?
- What are the ways in which cinema ==veils and unveils== our social realities?

### Key Elements of Digital Media
#### New media v.s. Old media
- Active v.s. Passive audience
- **Old media:** the modern industrial model
- Hegemony (Cultural/Economic/Political)
- **New media** is made up of a recombining or 'remediation' of content/aspects of old media
- The computer screen has become the primary way in which mediated culture is experienced

#### Essential Features of Digital Media
- **Technical processes:** technological aspects of production, distribution and consumption that ==influence the shape, character and potential== of digital media
	- Types:
		- **Digital**
			- binary code (0 and 1)
			- algorithmic manipluation
			- ease of use, storage, and distribution
		- **Networked**
			- decentralized
			- expanded choices
			- blurring of producer and consumer
		- **Interactive**
			- embedded in structure
			- context of communication
		- **Hypertextual/Hypermediated**
			- Linear v.s. non-linear
			- Interrupts authorship
		- **Automated**
			- created by databases
			- compiled using algorithms
			- in part, removes human intentionality
		- **Databased**
- **Cultural form:** cultural forms associated with digital media objects
	- impacts power geometry: access and ordering
	- database culture as antithetical to authorship
	- cultural forms
		- context
			- lots of aura (borgeois concept)
		- variability
			- inherently unfinished (continually updated)
			- symptoms of technical processes
				- manipluation invoicng algorithms
				- personalization and customization
				- continuous changes
		- rhizome
			- connection (connects to any point)
			- multiplicity (not a collection/one large thing)
			- decalcomania (transforms itself/it encounters)
			- cartography (enter any point, make own path)
			- heterogeneity (decentered)
			- asignifying rupture (breakages do not impede its function; but connections DO get lost)
- **Immersive experiences:** from a ==static== role of *viewer* to a role as *==active==, mobile user* or *participant* within the creation or digital space
	- telepresence
		- presence in an environment via a medium
			- simultaenously exist in different environments
		- vividness
			- depth (resolution), breadth (number of senses)
		- interactivity (degree of influence)
	- virtuality
		- exists, but not tangible/concrete
		- reality is always part virtual
		- contrasting the virtual/real; problematic
	- simulation
		- representation in concrete form
		- representation
			- imitation
			- no 'original'
			- copies of copies
		- hyperreality (real/imaginary collapse)
