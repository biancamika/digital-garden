## Soul's Gold Reading
- Higher Guide...Soul's Blueprint
	- Orange tree: very stubborn, rooted, persistent (may be perceived as stuck because it looks still)
	- very ecosystem
		- no door...all of it is important and full
	- Not super vocal... (higher guide) also ANGAS lol
	- high in pleasure and beauty
		- feeeling worthy, being okay with being seen
		- experiencing yourself as a gift...gifting to other people...
- You know how fruits aren't super juicy? ==Letting things blossom and ripen==
	- you can have different passions, but note that they all come to fruition at different times
	- but they rot if you miss the window
	- How to not feel overwhelmed: they all bloom and fall away at their own time. Whose season is it?
- be honest about the time and space each passion needs 
- Dance
	- my interest helps me go into the BODY... helps me be more present and conscious
	- ^ a lot of my different passions feels integrated in the body...dance helps me w/ this
	- being able to do it for yourself is important
	- feels a lot of grasping at my stomach
		- still stoking my own energy...
	- meeting yourself really intimately...and that includes physically
	- good investment in terms of humility, exploration...
	- PATH OF WEAVING
	- Human Design
		- marami kang nauuwi gamit ng body, and that's why you're drawn to the practice
	- di mo siya naexport
	- really wiring yourself back to it
	- Breaking
		- helps you focus, and harness your fire
		- testing your warrior and your focus
		- can also sense that i'm constantly putting yourself in situations of failure...building your resilience
- Design vs dance
	- broaden your concept of dance
		- it's not just the product...it's also the people's belief's and energy that clients want to emulate
		- your scope is limited
		- you're not just making the orange, you're making the TREE (you as a space, as a phenomena)
			- the project is an aftereffect of YOU as an EVENT
			- so cultivate more environments/containers...where you can plant 
	- PROCESS
	- is easier to talk about value, easier to charge, easier to talk about impact
	- dance is harder to codify...explain..
	- think about it in terms of branding
	- let it INTERSECT more
		- e.g. dance as a color scheme...
	- act as an interior designer.... of your life and your project
		- if you can explain why it works, then you can architect it more
		- AWARENESS
		- e.g. when you're looking for a song, you know that you're looking for the DRUMS
- warrior v.s. beauty
	- accomplishing v.s. seeing (i want to win v.s. i want to create)
- School
	- check-in with yourself...you are your best teacher
	- give yourself time to HEAR YOURSELF
	- don't get distracted with others.... (you tend to see other people as experts)
	- even if you compromise....just be clear on your stance
	- because if you don't have one, it's not balanced at all
	- let your creativity, inspiration, etc. TALK
- As an Ate
	- undertone of responsibility...
	- guiding siblings
	- "I need to stand my ground"
	- pinching energy with you and your family
	- ate role helps you stand up...
	- ^ but this gets tiring
	- strain sa neck, upper back
	- you don't give yourself as much credit for your role
	- a lot of my earlier creative projects were WITH/FOR my SIBLINGS
		- "doing dumb shit with them": that version of creativity
			- pure, joy
			- a source of INFINITE ENERGY
			- no expectations
			- you ==TAUGHT== your siblings how to do things
				- very natural for me to guide others in something you like to do
				- position your value in that way, it's effortless
			- a good memory to go off when you're making work (whether dance, art, design, etc.)...this is ==EXPRESSION== for me. don't forget it
		- reflects in better rapport with my generation??
- ADHD
	- hyperfixated = hunting
		- when you're hunting, just go for it
		- strong momentum
		- really hungry about understanding, nailing
	- you may have a lot of force, but you may be lacking in certain places...
		- e.g. order, structure, expertise
	- off-sourcing: delegating the shit you drop to other people
		- E.G. ideas on Twitter
		- free bread, eat your bread lol
	- trust that impulse!
	- when you go hunting, take a bird's eye view so that you can see the  logic/pattern/direction you're taking
	- you're moving because you have a QUESTION, it's the question you have a loyalty to. what's the question
- Partnerships
	- meant more for your PROJECTS
	- WHY: married the idea/question/vision you're running after
	- that's why chaotic people to resonate w/ others
	- Need MANAGER energy for chaotic energy
		- thinks about long-term stuff
		- thinks about systems, translation...
		- to address this, you need to 1.) know what you're doing 2.) get a manager who will give you a system
	- e.g. collabs; artistas w/ managers
	- hunter-gatherer symbiotic relationship
	- the more aware you are of this process, the more you can control? it
	- form of ADHD: "tracking shit in a forest"
	- Romance?
		- both approaches are valid (complementary vs same)
		- effortlessly giving love as a phenomena
		- my offering: lust for life, energy, feeling on fire (water-fire; cups-wands)
		- will become easier when one of your fattest fruits/projecs will fall/bloom
		- for me, love is a GIFT
			- even the project being completed is a GIFT
- How to address several directions
	- HONESTY with TIMING
	- you may have multiple things, but if you're really honest, it'll be... __
- ANXIETY
	- listen to yourself more
	- you're micromanaging other opinions of yourself....but you need to hear yourself first
	- pwede ka pa mag-delegate
		- "i hear you, but that's someone else's responsibility...or not relevant to me"
