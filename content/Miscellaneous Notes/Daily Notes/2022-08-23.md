## Principles and Methods of Teaching
#education #teaching 
### Understanding Effective Teaching
> _What is effective teaching? Who are effective teachers? What are factors that affect effective teaching practices?_

> In this course we will treat the word "teaching" broadly - most probably most of you would use the typical definition - "classroom teaching" - However, as you will learn about soon, as long as some basic elements are present, we can consider a scenario "teaching". These elements include, in its most basic form: the **teacher**, the **learner**, and the **matter** to be taught and learned. ==When we broaden our perspective, then this allows us to imagine that many things can be considered teaching== - a coach to a team, a manager to his/her staff, a parent forming a child, etc. However, we will practice the methods of more formal education (lesson planning, facilitating techniques, etc.) You are welcome to use the context you can more easily imagine yourself in.

#### About Teaching
##### Did the teacher teach?
> Share about your 2 experiences: one where your teacher  surely **"taught"** and one where you think your teacher **"did not teach"** - no need to mention the name of the teacher you are talking about :) Based on the 2 stories you recalled, how do you currently define/qualify what teaching is? Write a 1-2 sentence description.

I'll compare two classes. Both of them were similar in the sense that they had heavy required readings, which the teacher then discussed in class. In one class, the teacher was mostly reading off bullet point slides. These slides were hard to learn from without context; if you didn't read the reading, they'd seem like nonsense to you. Even if I was interested in the topic, I usually got sleepy during lectures; perhaps because I inherently thought I'd learn nothing from them. Meanwhile, in my other class, I loved the way the teacher designed his slides: they were simple (only one quote/definition) yet eye-catching. You could learn from them even if you didn't get to do the reading. I also appreciated how he constantly encouraged participation in class, making sure all of us gave our opinions on the reading. 

Overall, the former class was like a monologue, while the latter class was like a conversation. Based on these experiences, I define teaching as the intentional sharing of knowledge and experience, and I believe that both students and teacher should enjoy partaking in it.

##### What is teaching? (Hirst)
> To keep in mind:
> **1. What can be considered as part of the act of teaching? What isn't?**
	**2. Do you agree with Hirst's assertions about teaching?**

[**Hirst on What is Teaching**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsZTKTS30J4)
1. **Teaching is a polymorphous activity** 
	1. *Is teaching an activity?*
	2. Polymorphous simply means taking different forms.
	3. Teaching can come in different forms too - so maybe unlike other professional activities like baking or engineering - to define teaching based on activity alone would be difficult.
2. **Something is teaching if the intention is for someone to learn something.**
	1. *If it's not a specific activity, how then can we define it? Through its DYNAMICS*
	2. In the Ignatian Pedagogical Paradigm, St. Ignatius talks about the same dynamics between the teacher the learner and the truth, or what Hirst might calls something or "X".
	3. So, something becomes teaching if a teacher intends for learning to happen. 
	4. One way to describe the intention of teaching is to say that the goal of any teaching is change - a change in belief, attitude or skill.
3. **Activities of a teacher to bring about learning by someone.**
	1. *For us to be able to define teaching, we need to see it.
	2. 2 qualifiers:
		1. That the activities are done in a learning context with a clear intention towards the goal to be learnt.
		2. A teaching activity should be learner conscious.
			1.  This means that the intention should not just be about the matter to be taught (math, science, history, etc), but should be about intending for learning to happen among learners. 
			2. This means that teaching is not a one sided thing - It's not just about performing for an audience, it's about keeping in mind the intended goal for your learners-and when we recognize that the goal is change - it presupposes that each learner has a starting point. 
			3. What is that starting point? and what does the journey from point A to point B looks like - considering this is part of teaching.

**Summary of Hirst's ideas:**
1. Polymorphous activity
2. Intentional = learning for someone 
3. Activity that intends learning for someone

##### Your working definition

> Based on your reflection on Hirst's article entitled "What is teaching?", write your own working definition about what constitutes teaching.
> 1.) Keep your working definition within 3-5 sentences (you may use English or Filipino). Feel free to also approach this creatively - ex. come up with an analogy and start your definition with "teaching is like..." - or get a quote to emphasize what you mean. Feel free to also include an appropriate image to illustrate it.
> 2.) Apart from your working definition - explain how it aligns with or argues against Hirst's presentation (yes you can contend Hirst, but justify your contention don't just troll :)).

*"Teachers who inspire know that teaching is like cultivating a garden...those who would have nothing to do with thorns must never attempt to gather flowers." — Author unknown*

I've always loved seeing teaching as gardening, and Hirst's article confirmed this for me. Your goal is to help your student to grow into the best version of themselves, and accomplishing this requires tireless dedication put into various activities — planting the seeds of knowledge, tending to them over time, and pruning any weeds (i.e. blockers, biases, challenges) that may get in the way of growth. It's such a personalized process too; the way you nurture your students depends on their unique mindsets, along with their surrounding environments. Good teachers are like good gardeners in the sense that they know how to tailor to each and every case, ensuring that growth happens no matter what.
