### Types of Power
- **[[Compulsory power]]**
	- Robert Dahl: “A has power over B to the extent that he can get B to do something that B would not otherwise do”
	- Here, power is a matter of prevailing in a situation and is viewed as a ==zero-sum game==. When someone “wins” (i.e. gets what they want), someone also has to lose.
	- “Power is also exercised when A devotes his energies to creating or reinforcing social and political values and institutional practices that limit the scope of the political process to public consideration of only those issues which are comparatively innocuous to A.”
	- Compulsion is not just about us telling someone what to do. We are also compelled by someone when we are told what *not* to do. In other words, compulsory power is also a form of *setting the agenda* for someone else.
- **[[Institutional power]]**
	- Whereas compulsory power entails the direct control of one actor of the conditions and actions of another, **institutional power is actors’ control of others in indirect ways.** Specifically, the conceptual focus here is on the formal and informal institutions that mediate between A and B, as A, working through the rules and procedures that define those institutions, guides, steers, and constrains the actions (or non-actions) and conditions of existence of others, sometimes even unknowingly.
- **[[Structural power]]**
	- Structural power concerns the structures — or, more precisely, the co-constitutive, internal relations of structural positions — that define what kind of social beings actors are.
	- Whereas institutional power focuses on the constraints on interest-seeking action, structural power concerns the ==determination of social capacities and interests==
	- One, structural positions ==do not generate equal social privileges==; instead structures allocate differential capacities, and typically differential advantages, to different positions. 
		- Capital-labor and master-slave relations are obvious examples of how social structures constitute unequal social privileges and capacities. 
	- Two, the social structure not only constitutes actors and their capacities; it also ==shapes their self-understanding and subjective interests.== 
	- In other words, structural power can work to constrain some actors from recognizing their own domination. To the degree that it does, actors’ self understandings and dispositions for action serve to reproduce, rather than to resist, the differential capacities and privileges of structures
- **[[Productive power]]**
	- The constitution of all social subjects with various social powers through systems of knowledge and discursive practices of broad and general social scope
	- As Foucault explained, ==power lies at the bottom of all our social practices.== 
		- All actions and interactions, no matter how big or small, constitute what he calls “[[Relations of power]]”. 
		- The aim of the relations of power is to continuously determine and flesh out the subjectivity of individuals. 
		- A simple way to think of [[Subjectivity]] is to think of it as ==the way we identify ourselves and other people and our place in the social world.==
	- E.G. Filipino’s weak nationalism due to long history of colonization
	- Productive power differs from structural power in its approach to subjectivity. Because structural power concerns the constitution of subjects, it typically envisiions hierarchial and binary relations of domination that work to the advantage of those structurally empowered to the disadvantage of the socially weak. 
	- In contrast, productive power concerns the boundaries of all social identity, and the capacity and inclination for action of the socially advantaged and disadvantaged alike, as well as the myriad social subjects that are not constituted in binary hierarchical relationships
	- TL;DR Difference: You can gain more power based on the ==structure (structural)==, or based on your ==identity (productive)==

### From Power to Resistance
- Power and resistance are mutually implicated because of the social relations that shape the ability of actors to control their own fates are frequently challenged and resisted by those on the “receiving end”. 
- This does not mean, of course, that all actors are continuously engaged in every circumstance to achieve that ultimately impossible condition that Foucault critiqued as the “fully sovereign subject”. 
- **But there is a ==human inclination== to resist in the face of power and to seek greater capacity to influence the social forces that define them and their parameters of action, at least in the modern condition.**
	- Related to Aesthetics class lecture and [[Modernism]]
- Going back to Kerkvilet’s book, what type of power was established in Lita’s situation?
