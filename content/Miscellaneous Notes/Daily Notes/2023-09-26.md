### Democracy
- **Democracy** is a system that is meant to capture and consolidate the multifacetedness and multivocality of societies in order to help these societies attain common goals.
- 3 types of definitions:
	-  **Proceduralist:** emphasize the *formal* institutions and mechanisms of democracy. These scholars generally argue that societies can be identified and studied as democratic as long as these have procedures and processes that guarantee certain political outcomes.
		- For Schumpeter, democracy is “that institutional arrangement for arriving at a political decision in which individuals acquire power to decide by means of a competitive struggle for the people’s vote”.
		- Meanwhile, Huntington asserts that elections are “the central procedure of democracy” and that a political system is democratic to the extent that its “most powerful collective decision makers are selected through fair, honest, and periodic elections in which candidates freely compete for votes and which virtually all the adult population is eligible to vote,”
	- **Middle-range:** combines the proceduralist definition and with other institutions, mostly human rights, as fundamental to democracy.
		- Georg Sorensen, for example, succinctly defines the middle-range approach to defining democracy as “competition, participation, and civil and political liberties”.
		- This definition would look like what Robert Dahl identifies as a “political democracy”. **Political democracy** ensures that there are “unimpaired opportunities” for people to formulate and enact their preferences through individual and collective action.
	- **Long-range** definitions define democracy more broadly by adding more normative and substantive notions of political society to the definition
		- David Held, for instance,  argues that a democratic model of state and society should have “democratic autonomy” or “liberal socialism”
- Laclau and Mouffe’s definition of democracy can be called radical as the principle of democratization usually found in institutions and formal processes are extended even to the everyday interactions of citizens (recall [[Productive power]] in Barnett and Duvall)
- This definition is also “plural” in the sense that Laclau and Mouffe eschew the usual Marxist solution of armed struggle and revolution leading to the violent overthrow of the state as the end-all solution to the problem of class struggle
- For Laclau and Mouffe, the multiplicity of problems arising from contemporary late capitalism means that the solution to these problems must also be open to **“the principle that individuals should have the possibility to organize their lives as they wish, to choose their own ends, and to *realize* them as they think best.”
- Quimpo also makes use of Huber, Rueschemeyer, and Stephen’s view that there are essentially three types of democracy namely: **formal, participatory, and social.**
	- **Formal Democracy** -> combines four features:
		- Regular and free elections
		- Universal suffrage
		- Accountability of the state’s administrative organs to the elected representatives
		- And effective guarantees for freedom of expression as well as protection from arbitrary state action
	- These formal democracies can also grow into **participatory democracies** where all of these elements are present with high levels of participation from the people across social categories such as class, race, and gender.
	- Finally, the last type of democracy is **social democracy**, where this democratization is also extended so as to ensure equity not just in political processes, but also in the social and economic outcomes of society.
- Quimpo hopes that these combined frameworks will lead to what Juan Linz describes as a **“consolidated democracy”:** one where “none of the major political actors, parties, or organized interests, forces, or institutions consider that there is any alternative to democratic processes to gain power, and that no political institution or group has a claim to veto the action of democratically elected decision-makers”. In other words, **democracy is recognized as the non-negotiable backdrop and system for politics, the economy, and society.**
- **Patron-Client Interpretation:** long regarded as the most influential interpretation of Philippine politics. In this view, Philippine politics is about personal relations and networks linked by kinship, friendship, exchange of favors, influence, and money.
	- The resources of the state are seen as spoils for the victor, who then, by virtue of their office or power, are free to spend or spread these spoils around to their preferred clients which can take the form of either their family members, political and business allies, voters, and supporters.
