## Majestic Ship
### Information
- http://majesticship.com.ph/
- The goal is to draw in new customers who are not familiar with the company yet. We want the website to appear in the first page of search engines when they search for a shipping service relevant to what we do. We want to: 
	- Develop a website that has multiple pages that can communicate our services while being both simple and user-friendly (UX in mind) 
		- For this project, we want multiple pages with tabs at the top as opposed to having one full page for everything
	- Appear in the first page of Google and other search engines given certain search keywords (10-15 keywords) domestically (e.g. “tug and barge shipping service provider”)
- Budget is 20-25k with some flexibility
	- By final I mean last iteration of big edits and changes
- Final website launch by the first week of June 2023
