### Facilitating Learning: Teaching with Questions
_You will begin by exploring the whys, hows and whats of using questions for teaching._
#### The wise old man or the conductor?

Notice the two images above. We'll call the first one (left): "the wise old man"-with his arms behind him, like a supervisor inspecting goods, and his noticeably grey hair indicating age (and often with a connotation of wisdom). Then, we have the guy on the right picture. We'll call him "The Conductor" - portrayed looking at his orchestra, each member holding a musical instrument. 

These two guys are examples of ==how teachers perceive themselves.== Some perceive themselves like the wise old man, an expert and inspector, the source of wisdom and knowledge. If this teacher could choose a picture that would be posted on every starbucks, it will probably be of him talking in front of a lecture hall, with his students' eyes fixed on him. On the other hand, some teachers perceive themselves as the conductor - stepping into the classroom not just to be the source of "music" but to create the space for their students to "make music". _(Ok, obviously the analogy is not perfect - the orchestra often follows a certain musical piece and does not allow the members to go astray, which sometimes prefer to happen in the classroom, but I think you get the point)._ If the conductor were to choose an image for the starbucks poster, it will probably feature his students playing music, not him.

Of course, there is a place for both types of teachers: expertise is as important as the ability to facilitate learning. However, as we've learned from Hirst, it's not the teacher who does the learning, the students do. _Therefore, ==how might we effectively encourage students to think, engage and learn with us, teachers? How might we help our students "make music"?_== These are some of the questions we'll ask in this last module

#### Who is learning?
The tricky part about teaching is that learning is not very visible. After all, it's happening in the heads of your learners (more about this in part 2). However, despite this limitation, we do know **how** learning happens. _We know that learning is an active process!_
![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20221106234855.png]]

So, the key question is: How can we create more opportunities for this active process to happen? What we know from the earliest teachers (like Socrates) is that ==we can do it through questions!== Here's a quick trivia about questions. How many questions do you think a typical teacher asks everyday? The answer: 395. To illustrate, a grade 3 teacher asks a question every 43 seconds (Stevens in Mariano and Simms, 2014). 

==_What questions should we ask? Where will students' answers come from? How can we elicit responses from students?_ == These are some of the questions we'll discuss in this first part of the module.

#### Questions about questions
To help you design your own questions for your teaching, we will ask 3 important design questions:
1. What questions should we ask?
2. Where will students' answers come from?
3. How can we we elicit responses from students?

##### Questioning Techniques and Teachers’ Role in the Classroom
https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1268029.pdf

> The aim of this study is to discuss the ==efficacy of questioning techniques== of the teachers in the classroom. Proper questioning techniques are important in the teaching and learning process. Proper questioning techniques will make it easier for teachers to get feedback from students whether or not they understand the subject. This article describes some of the questioning techniques that a teacher needs to know to possess in classroom teaching and learning sessions such as ==attention, suitable voice. Pause, question content, and distribution of questions.== This is important for ==enhancing student motivation== and ==promoting positive, critical, and creative thinking== among students and ==to improve the teaching and learning process== in the classroom.

###### Questioning Techniques
1. Attention
	1. About this, the question must be ==addressed to the whole classroom== before a student is asked to answer.
	2. Teachers should also ==ask a question first before mentioning the name of a student to answer the question posed.== This is to ensure that all students are focused on the questions that are posted.
	3. Teachers should always ask questions to ==all students in the classroom== and not just to the students who raise their hands. Attention and care should be given to all the students in the classroom.
	4. In the meantime, some students who are not paying attention will ask the teacher to repeat the question. In this case, ==the teacher should not repeat the question posed when asked by the student to repeat it.== If the teacher repeats the question, then, of course, the student will not pay attention, so to attract the students, the teacher should mention the question only once.
2. Voice
	1. When asking questions, teachers should make sure ==their voices are clear and that their tone is well-heard.==
	2. The questions should be ==presented well and clear== to the students and look forward to receiving answers.
3. Pause
	1. After submitting a question, the teacher should be the one to ==pause talking for a moment and look at the whole class.== Note the ==verbal cues== that indicate that the student is ready to respond.
	2. After asking questions, students should be ==given time to think about the answers.== The time given should ==not be too long== because if it is too long, the interest in it will fade.
4. Content of Questions
	1. In asking a question, a teacher should plan the types of questions that will be asked in the classroom. 
		1. In this case, it may not be necessary for these questions to be prepared in advance, but the ==‘axis question’== needs to be designed. 
		2. The axis questions should be arranged in a logical order to obtain continuity in the lesson. In a given lesson, the teacher should provide some questions like this to ==determine the desired direction.== These questions should not be too long.
	2. At the same time, teachers should also ask questions that are ==relevant to the age and ability== of the students in the class. 
		1. Teachers are already aware of a student’s ability in a classroom. So when asking questions, teachers can ==ask difficult questions to the clever and gifted students, and ask easy questions to the weak students.== The simple questions posed to the weaker students will enable them to answer the question, and this will motivate them and stimulate their thinking.
	3. Teachers should also encourage ==questions that imply answers. ==
		1. Teachers should also ensure that the words used in a question are easy to understand. Students will be confused if they do not understand the words that are used in a question. 
		2. If a question is misunderstood by the students, the teacher should change his or her word, but the student should be given a chance to answer first.

###### Distribution of Questions
- In asking questions, teachers should ask questions to all students in the classroom. Questions shall be given to all the students to encourage them to participate in the teaching and learning process. (Atan Long, 1980: 145) 
- Teachers should also ==avoid asking questions according to the sitting position== of students in the classroom. This is because students who sat in the back and on the sides of the classroom are not paying attention and in the class. So, questions need to be posed to all students so that all students can focus and participate.
- In the meantime, any questions a teacher have to ask should be ==in place.== Teachers should ==avoid asking questions when students are in the process of conducting a study or project.== 
- In asking questions and receiving answers from students, teachers should always ==help the student to come up with the correct answers by pulling these answers out of him. ==In this way, students will think more deeply and will try to answer the question. “ (Sharifah Alwiah Alsagoff, 1983: 215)

###### Levels of Questions
- Questions that will be posed in the teaching and learning activity should be diversified by the levels of questioning.
- **Bloom's Taxonomy** applies here
	- Knowledge: Knowledge-based questions are questions that can easily digest students’ memory. These types of questions should be chosen by teachers, especially when presenting new topics or ideas for students.
	- Understanding: After being exposed to a concept and knowledge, teachers should ask questions that are comprehensible. This means that teaching and learning activities will take place in the dimension of understanding or understanding activities.
	- Application: The following features of the questions involve the use of information provided to students. The application questions are intended to help students apply their knowledge through the information provided during the teaching and learning activities.
	- Analysis: The feature of the analysis question is that this form of question works to separate ideas. At a higher level, students will be presented with analytical questions, and teachers need to be careful so that students can follow the content of the subject and apply all the skills to them.
	- Synthesis: Synthesis questions are questions that can help students to come up with a new idea through the initial information they are exposed to. These skills also require high skills in which teachers need to guide students until they can synthesize information.
	- Evaluation: At the highest level, evaluation based questions will be given to students. Evaluation means students should be able to make and maintain their justifications.

###### Other Categories of Questions
1. **First-Order Questions:** These types of questions are the most commonly used questions. This question is stated in sequence because it follows the sequence of disclosure of information provided in the teaching and learning activities
2. **Uncovered Questions:** Uncovered questions are a type of question that can gradually grind out students’ knowledge. This technique also requires teachers to tackle creative, clear, and easy questions so that students do not get bored.
3. **Open-Ended Questions:** Open-ended questions are a form of independent inquiry that seeks to assess students’ abilities and knowledge. Also, students may ask the teacher otherwise for the purpose of obtaining further certainty and clarification. This kind of response is something that is expected of teachers to identify students’ understanding
4. **Divergent Questions:** Divergent questions are questions that can generate a lot of thinking abilities among students. Subjective questions will help students broaden the scope of their thinking, and this is very important for them to improve their thinking skills.

##### Teaching with Questions Lecture
###### Part 1: What questions should I ask?
- 2 paradigms
	- **Question Types** (LOTS to HOTS based on Bloom's Taxonomy)
		- Examples:
			- Ecology ![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20221107004204.png]]
			- Marketing ![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20221107004356.png]]
	- **Questioning Sequences**
		- 4 phases (+ applied to the ecology example):
			- Details
				- Ask questions about important details/areas of focus
				- Based on learning outcomes
			- Categories
				- Identify examples within a category
				- Describe the general characteristics
				- Make comparisons within and across categories
			- Elaborations
				- explain reasons for characteristics (WHY)
				- describe effects of specific characteristics
				- project occurences under certain conditions (WHAT IF)
			- Evidence
				- identify sources
				- explain reasoning
				- qualify/restrict conclusions
				- find errors in reasoning used
				- examine elaborations from diff. perspectives
		- Example (applied to ecology) ![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20221107005913.png]]

> For learning or understanding to happen...
> There has to be...
> ...a provocative question
> ...a puzzling, important problem
> ...a challenge to current understanding
> - Dewey, 1997

###### Part 2: Where will students' answers come from?
- They come from...
	- Prior knowledge/experiences
	- Other sources
- Zone of Proximal Development
	- move slowly from what students can do to what they can't do

###### Part 3: How can I elicit responses?
- **Wait time**
	- Ask > Pause > Listen > Pause > Ask
	- "Research on classroom questioning and information processing indicates that students need ==at least three seconds== to comprehend a question..."
	- Wait time is think time
- **Random names**
	- Ask > Teacher picks a random name > Student answers
- **Response chain**
	- Ask > Student 1 answers > Ask Student 2 to respond to Student 1
- **Paired response** (a.k.a. Think-Pair-Share)
	- Ask > Students discuss > Students share to whole class
- **Quick writes**
	- Ask > Students write answers > Students share to the class

#### Design your questions
> Review the learning objectives in your lesson plan, or the ones you've posted in the past discussion forums. If you were to facilitate a discussion with your future students, what are 3 questions that you might ask? In the post below,
> 1. Identify the learning objective/s.
> 2. Identify the 3 questions and label them according to type or phase.

**Learning objectives:**
- Students should be able to demonstrate a sufficient understanding of the interactions between culture and technology through closed-book short answer tests where they have to cite keywords + insights from class readings.
- Utilizing critical theory, students should be able to analyze contemporary technologies through written long-form essays.

**Questions:**

I imagine myself asking these questions to my future students after making them watch this documentary called *Terms and Conditions:*

> **Terms and Conditions:** a documentary film that addresses how corporations and the government utilize the information that users provide when agreeing to browse a website, install an application, or purchase goods online. The film criticizes companies such as [Facebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook "Facebook"), [Google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google "Google"), and [LinkedIn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LinkedIn "LinkedIn") for having poorly worded and misguiding [privacy policies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_Policy "Privacy Policy")/[terms of service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terms_of_service "Terms of service"), which use user-unfriendly language in long documents and allows the companies to collect user information and legally provide it to third-parties.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terms_and_Conditions_May_Apply#cite_note-1) The film aims to warn people about the risks of clicking "I Agree" after scrolling through pages of uninviting text.


1. Connect components of a social media platform to elements of structuralism. (Categories)
	1. Sign: user-generated content (e.g. posts, stories, comments, etc.)
	2. Code: user-service agreements
	3. Myth: "It's okay to give away your personal data" a.k.a. being apathetic about data privacy
2. Why do social media platforms uphold this myth about data privacy? (Elaborations)
3. How can users hold platforms accountable for these privacy issues? (Evidence)

#### Key ideas about Teaching with Questions

**1. Questions** (not just answers) **drive learning.**
Often, as teachers, there could be a tendency to focus on what we will say (or present), not what we will ask. As we've discussed in this module, ==what we ask matters, because our questions prompt thinking.==

**2. Interaction should be intentionally designed, not just a happy accident.**
Although there are many things we cannot predict about how our class sessions will go, it still pays to be intentional with the kinds of interaction you would like to have with your students and among your students. As an expert teacher in the future, this may just end up feeling "natural", such that you don't feel like you need to plan it out anymore (just like in other professions), but as a novice educator, the invitation is to ==carefully plan your "teaching moves"  first.==
