### Module 3.2: **Reformation**
_Then, we will see how the "comeback" of Religion as a force in education comes to be, with a special mention of the role of the Jesuits in this movement._

#### The Protestant Reformation
- In response to humanism, what follows is what is referred to in history as the "reformation". In this module, we look into 2 movements, led by 2 religious groups: the Protestants and the Catholics.
- Here's an interesting thought exercise to get you started: **If you were part of a religious group, observing the movements during the Renaissance, how would you react? What would you critique?**
- Your logic will probably lead you to why these two religious groups felt the need for "reformation".

**[History 101: The Protestant Reformation | National Geographic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IATyzSAjC1w)**
- The Reformation was a revolution of religion in Western Europe. Essentially, it was the result of ==centuries worth of political and social grievances against the Christian Church== as it existed.
- This tension was exacerbated by the transformative social and intellectual period known as the Renaissance. In particular, this period involved the rise of [[Humanism]]: a philosophy that shifted man's faith from being determined by religious doctrine to being ==determined by man himself==
- However, one of the most well-known advocates for a reformed Christian church was a German priest named **Martin Luther**. Martin Luther began to question the church in the early 1500s. He believed it was abusing its power and disagreed with some of its practices.
	- E.G. he challenged the church's doctrine that stated the Pope, not the Bible, was the ultimate spiritual authority
	- Plus he criticized the church for selling indulgences: the practice of purchasing forgiveness for one sins by giving money to the church
- Luther believed the church needed to revise its doctrine by returning to the Bible's teachings and by saying that ==salvation could be granted by faith in Christ alone.==
- So on October 31st 1517, Luther took a stand -- what's considered the birth of the Protestant Reformation. Luther is said to have nailed ==95 theses or arguments against the church== on to the door of Castle Church in Wittenberg, Germany.
	- Luther was later put on trial in front of church officials to defend his theses but in January 1521 the church declared Luther a heretic and excommunicated him
- Unlike Luther's predecessors who challenged the church, Luther had one tool at his disposal -- that they didn't have the **printing press**. This new invention allowed his arguments to be ==copied and spread across Europe==
- This unprecedented access to ideas such as Luther's inspired many others to challenge the church there by splitting Christianity into two major denominations: **Catholic** and **Protestant** (from the word protest).
- Also the Bible became more accessible. Luther and other reformists translated biblical text from Latin (which was only known by nobility and church officials) to German, English, and French languages (spoken by the general public).
- While the Protestant Reformation revolutionised the Christian faith, it had ramifications that extended beyond religion.
	- Prior to the Reformation, ==many Europeans were dependent on an educated upper class.==
	- But perhaps the most resounding impact of the Reformation was that ==the common people were empowered to question religion and other aspects of life.==
- The Reformation (along with technological innovations and the introduction of other new ideas) gave many in Europe'sgeneral public the freedom and power to decide their own fate

**Guide questions:**
>1. In what way was Protestant education different from the prevailing educational thought at that time (renaissance/humanism)?
>2. What educational issues did the reforms addressed?

#### Catholic Reformation
So, how did the Catholic Church respond to the protestant reformation? Here, we'll learn about another reformation (referred to as the counter-reformation), this time within the Catholic Church (Watch out for a special mention of the Jesuits).



Aside from the Jesuits, three other groups contributed to the propagation of the educational thought of the catholic reform movement.  These were the Brethren of Christian Schools, the Port Royalists and the convent schools. Read [The Catholic Reformers Attitude Toward Education (Wilds & Lottich, pp. 190-197)](https://ateneo.instructure.com/courses/30243/files/5504527?wrap=1 "CATHOLIC REFORMATION.pdf") to find out about the contribution of these congregation to contemporary education.
