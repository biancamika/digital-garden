## Biology of Science Fiction
#sciencefiction 
### Alimuom Talk
- Don't just do worldbuilding to make something cool...think about what you want to say
- What historical reality can you link it to?
	- E.G. Martial Law = Miracle Rice, old chairs
- Filipino aesthetic....try to draw from present reality (e.g. cords everywhere)
- The Philippines, a third-world country, would always be behind first-world countries in terms of innovation, so reflect that
	- Explains the "ancient" devices being used, the trashed down places
	- Also encouraged constant reusing and refurbishing

## Deconstructing the present to reconstruct the future: An introduction to Causal Layered Analysis
#future 
- Goals
	- Make sense of what is happening right now
	- Figure out what we can do about it
- Outline
	- Futures thinking at a glance
	- What is CLA?
	- E.G. a CLA of the future of Philippine health professionals
	- Brainstorming activity
- Futures thinking
	- An exploratory study of future conditions based on current trends
		- Advancements in technology and innovation
		- Current issues like global geopolitics, environmental conditions, and sustainability
	- May also be known as futures studies, futures research, futurology, or strategic foresight
- **Six Foresight Competencies (APF)**
	- Framing: defining the focal issue and current conditions
	- Scanning: exploring signals of change and cross-impacts
	- Futuring: identifying a baseline and alternative futures
	- Visioning: developing and commiting to a preferred future
	- Designing: developing prototypes and artifacts to achieve goals
	- Adapting: generating strategies for alternative futures
- **What futures thinking can do**
	- Risk anticipation and management
	- "Future proofing"
	- Long-term strategic planning
	- Management of emerging technologies
	- Narrative creation
	- Prototyping present conditions
- Futures thinking does NOT aim to predict the future
- Some tools in futures studies
	- Cross-impact analysis
	- Trend analysis
	- Delphi
	- Emerging issues analysis
	- Horizon scanning
	- Futures wheel
	- Backcasting
	- Causal layered analysis
- Causal layered analysis (Inayatullah, 1988)
	- Used in critical futures thinking (as compared to empirical/number-based or normative/value-based; mix of both)
	- Deconstruction and reconstruction from an alternative worldview
	- Four layers: litany, systems, worldviews, and metaphors
	- "Poststructuralism as method"
	- Assumes a less desirable current state, or at least a present thst needs reform
	- Based on the current situation, how would a more desirable future look like? What needs to change?
- Layers
	- Litany
		- Problem or issue as manifest in everyday oife
		- External reality
		- Newspaper headlines, opinions, events, media, broadcasts, etc.
		- Changes from day to day
	- Systemic causes
		- Usually, social science roots of everyday litanies
			- Systemic change in a world that rmains the same will not be able to sustain itself
		- Connections as explored in economics, history, sociology, politics, and other forms of social analysis
		- Longer timeframe of understanding
	- Worldviews
		- Cultural, normative discernment
		- Utilizing means of how different grouos of people understand the world
		- Discourse, belief, inner assumptions
		- Deep cultural embeddedness
	- Myth and metahor
		- Narratived as reflections of deeper, unconscious set of norms
		- Most internalized layer which "governs" a person's worldview
		- Less visible layer, usually only manifest in stories and figures of speech
		- In CLA, this is where the root causes of the present issues lie (where you stop)
			- At such, this is also where to start a new narrative in reconstructing the future
- Deconstruction: internalized root causes
	- Identify current issues, "litanies"
	- Social analysis of existing phenomenons
	- Exploring worldviews which support existing social systems
	- Digging the narratives scaffolding our belief systems
- Reconsturction: forming a desired future
	- Change the narrative
	- Review our vision of the world based on these newly-imbibed narratives
	- Formulate new systems and social structures based on changed worldviews
	- Manifest a new, more desired future, where headlines tell of accomplished end gosls rather than existing ills
- MediSinag 2070: A Future Scenario for Philippine Health Professionals
	- Defining the Philippine Health Professional
	- Challenges Faced (Litany)
		- Nurse strike, toxic workplaces, low salary, not allowed to work abroad
		- Have always been present; Exacerbated during the pandemic
	- Exploring a Future Scenario
		- What if the current issues faced by health professionals can be explored deeply, towards the root causes and cultural understandings!
		- Based on the identified issues, what if a future scenario can manifest where health professionals in the Philippines become the most fulfilled, hgihly innovative, and holistically trained by the year 2070?
		- What if social, educational, economic, political, and cultural changes can be anticipated for this future to happen?
	- Futures Thinking in Health
		- Understanding the pandemic as a "disruptions of life systems" (Bosch, 2020)
			- Ecological in a sense
	- MediSinag: Insights
		- A better future is definitely possibke
		- Other scenarios possible as well, including undesirable ones
		- Futures are emergent, so anticipations must be adaptive and flexible
		- Active, sustained effort is required to achieve the desired future
		- Get people who can get us to this desired future in power
		- The core beliefs we must have
		- We need to understand ourselves and our countrymen better and deeper

**CLA: Deconstruction**
| Layer      | Scheme |
| ---------- | ------ |
| Litany     |        |
| Systems    |        |
| Worldviews |        |
| Metaphors  |        |

**CLA: Reconstruction**
| Layer      | Scheme |
| ---------- | ------ |
| Litany     |        |
| Systems    |        |
| Worldviews |        |
| Metaphors  |        |

- Let's brainstorm!
	- Let's try exploring a more inclusive future for...education
	- Based on our current situation, are we inclusive? Why or why not? (Present litany)
		- Impending strike; Treatment of unionized workers
		- Making education fully co-ed
		- Social inequality among students
		- Territorial claims e.g. "Gatekeeping Arete" -> banning loitering
		- Inequality among faculty; Academic tenure -> reliant on Masters and PhD degrees
		- Outdated enlistment process
		- Antagonization of GE subjects
	- Explore the systems and worldviews which prop up the kind of education we have today. 
		- Systems
			- Lack of inclusive policies
			- Undermining/busting unions
			- Endo
			- Admin changes leading to retrenchement
			- Power imbalance
			- Positions of privilege
			- Value of specialization over general education
		- Worldviews
			- Neoliberal capitalism
	- As students, if you were to describe the inclusiveness of our education system into a metaphor, what would it be like?
		- We stand on a hill
		- Ateneo is a brand
		- Irony of cura personalis
	- For you, what makes education inclusive? How would you describe an inclusive education?
- Lessons from CLA
	- Changing for a better future may require exploring the collective unconscious
	- The deeper the CLA layer, the longer it takes to reconstruct
	- Systemic change, no matter how effective or responsive, will not sustain a targeted future unless its cultural rootedness is also changed
	- If we want an inclusive future, start with internalizing narratives of inclusion
