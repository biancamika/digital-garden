### Who Makes Art
#### Who Makes Art
- Although artists generate the guiding idea, they do not always make the actual art objects
- Various cultures have different expectations of artists, their social roles, and responsibilities
##### Art Production as a **Social Activity**
- Culture develops a tradition of art-making, as well as an understanding and definition of art
- Various individuals, groups, and forces are also important for setting the standards and determining what art is in a particular culture
- The significance and meaning of art needs to be articulated (as in a body of knowledge)

##### The Creative Act
- Artists take meaningful ideas — social ideas, intensely personal ideas, spiritual ideas, political ideas — and embody them in a visual form that holds our attention, grips our emotions, and/or engages our imagination
- Artists' works are either unique and innovative, or are vital restatements of traditional ideas; restatements and not copies

##### Training of Artists
- A lot of artists are taught by ==family members==
- Historically, many artists were taught/trained using the ==**master-apprenticeship method**==
- Some very skilled apprentices actually make part of the master’s artwork, but the ==final product is owned by and credited to the master artist==; common during the Renaissance
- ==Specialized societies== sometimes preserve technical information important in the training of artists, and regulate art making (e.g. guilds)
- ==**Art academies**== are a more recent invention for the training of artists, where systematized art instruction occurred within the classroom
- Art academies typically:
	- Provide art training for students
	- Sponsor lectures in theory and set standards
	- Accept mature artists as members
- In part, academies helped break the power of the guilds, which to some extent were stifling innovation because their rigid regulations imposed uniformity upon their members

##### Context of Art Making
- **Workshops:** businesses composed of apprentices, assistants, and specialists who operate under the name of a master artist
- **Community Art Making:** large groups of people contribute directly to art production
- **Hiring out the making of art:** artists hire others to make their artwork
- **Artist as Object Maker:** individual artists make their own artwork (expected norm)
- **Collaborations:** art making becomes a collaborative activity among different artists

##### The Role of Artists in Various Cultures
- The ==artist’s position in society== reflects how that culture uses art, how it values art, and what it expects the artist to do as a member
	- In some cultures, certain art objects are made by men and others by women; this usually ==reflects the different roles, rights, and responsibilities of males and females within==
- Artists are seen as ==skilled workers or laborers==
- Art and artists can also gain inspiration from other fields such as science, and are thus ==viewed as scientists==, to a certain extent
- Art is often the ==vehicle of spirituality==, and thus the artist is sometimes seen as also being a holy person, priest, or shaman
- Meanwhile, in Europe, the concept of the ==artist as a creative genius== began to emerge during the Renaissance; 14th century Europe
	- Prior to that time, artist were mainly considered as ==skilled laborers/workers==
	- During the ==Romantic Era==, the emphasis on freedom, uniqueness, feeling, individuality, and imagination augmented this view

##### Support for Art Making
- Even though art is essential to a culture, it is an activity that ==can occur only when the is some kind of surplus== — time, food, or money
- Three ways to support art making — direct support, commissions, and selling works
- **The Fine Art Market** - artists make works to sell through commercial galleries (auction)
- **Tourist Market** - works made specifically for tourists; removed from its original context
- **The Art Collector** - interested in art as an investment, or as a status symbol, while others seem truly taken with the work
- **Tax-supported art** - National Artist
- ==“Never worship an artist because they aren’t different from you”==

#### What Do We Do With Art
- People use it, through performance or display
- Cultures or groups keep art because it is meaningful to them and enriches their lives
##### Four Reasons Why Art is Kept
- Aesthetic/civilizing/educational purposes
- Religious reasons
- Political purposes
- Commerce
##### Art Collections
- Museums and private collections
- National museums
- Art museums
- Regional museums
- Museums and new technology
