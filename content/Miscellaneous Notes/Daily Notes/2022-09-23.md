> How teachers understand teaching very much affects what they actually do in the classroom. (Hirst, 1971)

**Metaphors for teaching**
- Art: sculpting, painting, entertaining
- Business: selling, delivering, marketing, advertising
- Science: experimenting, solving a problem, a treasure hunt
- Commanding a ship crew, where the teacher is the captain
- Sports game, where the teacher is the coach
- Journey: like a game, a roller coaster ride
(Chen, 2003)

**Food for thought:**
- Reflect on your strengths and weaknesses, and how they might affect your teaching.
- What does good teaching look like?
