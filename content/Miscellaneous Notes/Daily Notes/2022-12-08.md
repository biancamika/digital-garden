## Thesis
#thesis
### Notes Dump
- Does digitalization reinforce/strengthen ==structures of domination==? Or does it instead foster social ==emancipation==?
- ubiquitous computing (a paradigm wherein computing is made to appear anytime and everywhere) is done through rendering technology invisible, which in turn obscures the human labor behind it. (PUT THIS AFTER YOUR EXAMPLES)
- Digital technologies have woven themselves into our everyday lives to the point that they are indistinguishable from it.
- Let me present a parable from David Foster Wallace: There are these two young fish swimming along and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says “Morning, boys. How’s the water?” And the two young fish swim on for a bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes “What the hell is water?” I see this story as an apt analogy for our relationship with technology.

### Research Dump
- Emancipation of the Virutal
	- a lot of young people are embedded in these technologies without fully understanding what they're about
	- before discussing the emancipation of the virtual, we must understand the dynamics of operation in the virtual. Basically, emancipation from what?
	- So what dynamics of operation are embedded in virtual systems?
		- **Exploitation of human and material resources**
			- Ubiquitious computing: technologies that integrate so well into our space to the point that they are invisible
				- not only is technology made invisible to us...also the human exploitation behind it
			- Example case: Indigenous Circuits...invisible worker in this case is Navajo Women

			- ![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20221208122838.png]]
		- **Ideological battle to justify exploitation**
			- exploitation is presented as good for everybody
			- questioning not just our relationship with technology, but also our relationship with modernity
			- ![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20221208114149.png]]
			- Linking colonial modernity and people's conception of time ![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20221208124340.png]]
			- Technology portrayed as the only way 
				- Technology as the future
				- Technology as the present
				- Anyone who does not fit into this ideology is seen as the past
		- **Large-scale reproduction of social inequality, and limitation of access to dignity**
			- Modernity allows technology to reproduce inequality at a large scale
				- Amnesia
				- invisibilization of technology
				- absence of transparency
			- Examples of inequality ![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20221208131648.png]]
		- **Locking the imagination**
			- Iyo's work: interested in the biases that show the link between technologies and systems of domination
			- Locked imaginary: technologies provide biased representations because their makers' imaginations are limited
			- Example: she could not use her ID photos because the coloring? was made for white women

	- Let's see the gray in technologies
		- Black v.s. white hackers...what is black technology? What is white technology?
		- Optimistic ways of seeing technology...how can we use technologies for emancipation?
			- Creation of space through collages

			- Creation of space through virtual environments

			- Transmission and Education
				- we need to transmit history
