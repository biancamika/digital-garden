### Final Paper
#### Instructions
Discuss **evolution and evolutionary** **principle** using **any three (3) science fiction texts from the syllabus** to support your discussion. Discuss the different ways in which the three texts **display and hyperbolize different aspects of evolution**, as well as what they have in common. Talk about **how your chosen texts use their _nova_ use evolution to communicate and explore their themes and ideas**.

Feel free to use additional research to enhance your analysis, but it's not strictly necessary. Please cite your sources (any citation method is fine, but be consistent).

#### Submission
##### Idea Dump
- Evolution: the change in heritable characteristics of biological populations over successive generations.
	- Module 1
		- Framework for science fiction
		- Principles
			- [[Permanent Notes/Red Queen Hypothesis]]
			- [[Permanent Notes/Evolutionary Arms Race]]
		- The Worldview of Science Fiction?
		- Dragons can be good models for understanding the basic concepts of evolutionary biology.
	- Module 2
		- Evolution explains **biodiversity**
			- [[Permanent Notes/Speciation|Speciation]]
			- [[Permanent Notes/Niche|Niche]]
			- [[Permanent Notes/Competitive Exclusion Principle|Competitive Exclusion Principle]]
		- We make sense of species and their evolutionary relationships through **classification**
			- The other-ness of aliens can be treated as taxonomic cognitive estrangement ([[Permanent Notes/Cognition|Cognition]] and [[Permanent Notes/Estrangement|Estrangement]])
		- Other principles (seen in texts)
			- [[Permanent Notes/Eusociality|Eusociality]]
			- Assimilation
			- [[Permanent Notes/Fermi Paradox|Fermi Paradox]]
	- Module 3
		- Speculative evolution
			- Speculative ==human== evolution..."human" term is loaded with social and biological connotations
		- Origin hypotheses
			- Directed panspermia
			- Primordial soup
			- Iron-sulfur world
		- Central Dogma of molecular biology: protein make-up determines what we are
		- Evolution: gradual genetic change at the population level
			- Change
				- accounted for by mutations
			- Gradual
				- accumultation of small, incremental changes
			- Population, not individual level
				- changes in frequences of alleles
		- **Natural selection** is a mechanism for evolution
			- Based on competition for resources and the consistent differences in the fitness of individuals in an environment
			- **Fitness:** the ability of an organism to reproduce and pass on its genes to the next generation.
			- **Adaptations:** traits that raise fitness
		- Human evolution and speciation
			- Evolutionary pressures still apply to us, even if we have more agency compared to other species
			- evolution can happen without speciation
			- remember: Speciation requires **reproductive isolation** and **adaptations**
		- [[Transhumanism]]
	- Module 4
		- Sex, gender, and reproduction
			- One's reproductive biology is a determinant of one's identity and social role
			- Parthogenesis
			- Sci-fi can defamiliarize these oconcepts to present alternative definitions for "normal"
		- Parasites, Pathogens, Body Horror
			- estranged, hyperbolized versions of *ab*normality
		- Sci-fi Sex
			- Sexual selection: important evolutionary force that shapes organisms
				- main reason behind **sexual dimorphism**: condition wherein two sexes are anatomically different
		- our experience and language not universal and cannot be expected to be universal.
		- Disease and Parasitism
			- diseases: state
			- parasitism: relationship
	- Module 5
		- Biotechnology
		- [[Utopia]] and [[Anti-utopia]]
		- [[Alienation]]
	- Module 6
		- Ecology and evolution: all about interconnectedness
		- [[Political ecology]]
		- [[Remediation]]
	- Modules I'm covering:
		- Origins of Life and Species
		- Biology and Society
		- Ecology and Worldbuilding
- Texts
	- The Time Machine 
	- Sense8
	- X-Men (House of X and Planet-Size X-Men)
