### Module 3.1: Social Capital as Brokerage and Closure
#### Lecture
**[Brokerage and Culture: The Importance of Social Capital](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMEz_Ou88Oo)**
- [[Social capital]] really is about the ==connections== that you make with other people and how that ==benefits== you
	- Thinking of it like capital...look at your relationships as personal ==investments==
- Self-help isn't just about the self. It's about the relationships that we have , and how these relationships benefit us. That is [[Social capital]]
- What do you get from your social networks?
	- You may say support, love, affection
	- But more importantly, we also get ==opportunities== and ==information==

##### Brokerage
- **Brokers:** people who are part of at least two distinct networks, connecting people from these to each other
	- Similar to real estate
- A network indicates the distribution of information, which we define as an advantage: if you have more information, you are at a better position.
	- ![[images/Social Capital Expansion.png]]
	- **Closed networks:** consisted of people who all know each other well 
		- When you're part of a closed network, it means that ==you're working off the same information.== You don't have an advantage for having any more information because the information that you get is similar to what everyone already knows.
	- But if you try to be a broker, making a deliberate effort to be a connective tissue across different networks...
		- You get a new network while still keeping your original network
		- You have information breadth, timing
		- You arbritage. You're brokering, bringing together, innovating
	- Similar to the concept of [[Weak ties]]?
- [[Create value by bridging structural holes]]. Here are some specific terms and their definitions:
	- **Sticky information:** information expensive to move because: (a) tacit, (b) complex, (c) requires other knowledge to absorb, or (d) interaction with sender, recepient, or channel
	- **Structural hole:** disconnection between two groups/clusters of people
	- **Bridge:** relation across structural hole
	- **Network entrepreneur:** a person who bridges across a structural hole. Also known as "broker" or "connector" 
	- **[[Brokerage]]:** act of coordinating across a structural hole
- [[Business success decreases as the network around a person closes]]
	- ![[images/Business Network Constraints.png]]
	- Those who connect many structural holes, they have a higher performance. Those who have fewer structural holes, those who are more in close networks, their relative performance is actually less.
- Takeaway: be part of different groups, so that you can get different information. Then, use this information to innovate, to create new ideas.
	- You don't have to disperse yourself too much. Just be open to different connections.
	- But remember that it's also important to settle in a group, to have your own expertise
- How [[Brokerage]] works: ===Creativity and innovation=== are at the heart of it
	- ![[images/Brokerage, Creativity, and Innovation.png]]
	- If you're brokering relationships, you get to see alternative perspectives. You get to see best practices, and adapt them to your own contexts.
- Summary points
	- **[[Network structure is a proxy for the distribution of information]]**
		- For reasons of opportunity, shared interests, experience — simple inertia — organizations and markets drift towards the bridge-and-cluster structure known as a =="small world"==
	- Rules of [[Social capital]]:
		- **[[Brokers do better]]**
			- Bridge relations across the structural holes between clusters provide information breadth, timing, and arbritage advantages, such that network brokers managing the bridges are at higher risk of "productive accident" in detecting and developing good ideas.
			- By clearing the sticky-information market across organizations, brokers tend to be recognized leaders. They are better compensated, more widely celebrated, and more quickly promoted than their peers. Some specifics:
				- Close networks do not identify unintelligent managers so much as expert specialists.
				- Creativity & innovation is an ==import/export process.== Value is not at the innovation source. It emerges each time productive new knowledge is adopted in a target audience.
				- Creativity & innovation depend on the network as well as the inventive person. It does not depend on individual genius so much as it depends on employees finding opportunities to broker knowledge from where it is routine to where it would create value.
		- **[[Contingent returns to brokerage]]**
			- To the extent that the broker is creating something new, there is no guarantee that the proposal will work in our market, with our company processes, staffed by our people. There is risk to accepting the proposal. 
			- Chains of command broken in service of company interests can just as easily be broken in service of personal interests, or in service of well-intentioned but strategy-eroding interests. 
			- Social standing in the form of job rank, network status, or reputation is the way would-be brokers overcome the suspicions with which brokers can be viewed. 
			- Reputation is particularly valuable. It legitimates the largest number of people to be successful brokers.

##### Closure
- **[[Closed networks facilitate trust and shared beliefs by creating and maintaining reputations]]**
	- ![[images/Closed networks and reputations.png]]
- **[[Closure creates "bandwidth"]]: more channels of communication allow more accurate and rapid communication, so poor behavior is more readily detected and managed.**
	- **[[Closure]]:** the lack of structural holes within a network
	- ![[images/Closure creates bandwidth.png]]
	- Closure can also be very good because it increases your ==trust==
- **Bottom-line performance advantage of closed networks: [[Reputation mechanism generates trust and efficiency**]]
	- By creating a wide bandwidth for information flow, closure enhances communication and personal visibility within a group...
		- which creates reputation costs for individuals who express opinion or behavior inconsistent with group standards,
		- which makes in-group behavior less likely, so trust is less risky,
		- which enhances productivity as people become self-aligning in extraordinary efforts to preserve their reputation (lowering costs for labor, monitoring, quality, and speed)
	- Reputation is the mechanism by which [[Closure]] has its effect. [[Closure]] delivers value by creating a reputation cost for deviation from cooperative, extraordinary effort. In other words, ==closure grows the bottom line. == 
	- Closure is often associated with successful efficiency programs (e.g. SixSigma)
- Closure is essential to reputation. Positive and negative reputations quickly stabilize. What implications does this have for building reputation?
- Summary points
	- Rule of [[Social capital]]: **Reputations emerge from gossip in close networks, which generates a sense of community and efficiency as a by-product**.
		- Network closure enhances communication and visibility within a group,
			- (a) which creates reputation costs for individuals who express opinion or behavior inconsistent with group standards, 
			- (b) which increases the probability of trust and cooperation within the group, 
			- (c) which enhances productivity as people become self-aligning in extraordinary efforts.
		- Higher productivity comes from lower costs for labor, management, and time. Closure delivers value by creating a reputation cost for deviation from shared colleague opinion and practice. 
	- CAUTION: **The reputation mechanism by which closure delivers value can have a side-effect of groupthink, a passive "waiting for orders", and so value destruction**.
		- When information moves unaffected through a network (e.g. eBay), closure creates wide bandwidth, facilitating trust and efficiency.
		- However, social networks usually involve an ==etiquette filter.== The more polite the people, the more etiquette affects what is shared, so ==closure produces echo, not bandwidth.==
		- The information that defines reputation is selected for empathy between gossipers, not accuracy about the person/object being discussed. The result is ==ignorant certainty== and you no longer own your reputation -- your reputation is owned by the people who gossip about you.
		- Therefore, there are three key players in reputation development: you, your contact, and the contact's colleague.
		- Build by focusing on projects colleagues will want to discuss. Allowed to develop unchecked, the ignorant certainty fostered by closed-network echo can become rigid stereotypes about people and practices outside the group (with predictable problems for the realized value of diversity), and people withdraw into Milgram's agentic state, waiting for orders.
- Overall, you need both [[Brokerage]] and [[Closure]]

#### Strength of Weak Ties
**[Social Networks and Getting a Job: Mark Granovetter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3bBajcR5fE)**



#### Social Map
##### Instructions
Now that you know the importance of social capital--that is, your social connections, networks, and your strong and weak ties--**create a sociogram or social map.** 
-   You can draw your social map of strong and weak ties (have at least 20 connections there).
    -   Take a photo of it, put it in a document.
    -   In the same document, answer these questions in a paragraph form:
        -   Am I a broker or am I part of a closed network? 
        -   How many "groups" or "clusters" of people do I broker?
        -   What have been the benefits of belonging to different clusters? What have been the benefits of having a closed network?
        -   What can I do to achieve an optimal social network?
    -   Submit a **PDF** document.

##### Answer
I primarily see myself as a broker. Being a polymath, my various interests have led me to broker multiple groups of people; this can be best seen in how I am part of both dance and tech communities. Belonging to different clusters makes me a T-shaped person: someone who is both a generalist and a specialist, making them highly valuable. For instance, the mindfulness I acquired as a dancer helps me create user-friendly designs, and the computational thinking I learned in computer science helps me in self-studying certain skills/moves; overall, my unique experience in both dance and tech gives me a deep understanding of human cognition. I also acknowledge that having a closed network allows me to grow my reputation. I have been able to witness this by being part of Ateneo's orgs for dance and human-centered design, both of which are known for being excellent in their respective crafts. Interacting constantly with both current members and alumni of these organizations provided me opportunities for my personal development (e.g. internships, freelance projects, gigs). Overall, I believe that achieving an optimal social network requires a keen eye for structural holes, whether it's between or within clusters.  Knowing what is needed will help you not only create new connections, but also nurture your existing relationships.
