Reading 5: **Images of Integrity / Across the Great Divide** (Parker Palmer)

### Reflection Questions
-   **What are some characteristics of the _divided life_?**
	- We refuse to invest ourselves in our work, diminishing its quality and distancing ourselves from those it is meant to serve
	- We make our living at jobs that violate our basic values, even when survival doesn't demand it
	- We remain in settings/relationships that steadily kill of our spirits
	- We harbor secrets to achieve personal gain at the expense of other people
	- We hide our beliefs from those who agree with us to avoid conflict, challenge, and change
-   **What was the purpose of Palmer's comparison between children and adults?**
	- It shows us that our lives weren't always so divided; before, there was a time when we were truly in touch with our souls.
	- However, we slowly became masked and armored adults when the outer world became more demanding for us, forcing us to play a role withdrawn from our souls
-   **What did Palmer mean when he talked about a _masked and armored life_? Why do people live this kind of life?**
	- The masked and armored life is BLANK. It looks like...
	- People live this kind of life because our culture has taught us that this is the safe and sane way to live.
-   **Why do people need what Palmer calls _circles of trust?_**
