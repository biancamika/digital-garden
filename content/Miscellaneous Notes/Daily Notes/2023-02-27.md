### Module 3.1: **The Renaissance**
To guide your thinking in this module, we will anchor our discussions on this essential question **"What is most important to learn?"** _First, we will explore a famous movement called the Renaissance, and how the rise of Science and Art (spoiler alert) shifted the tides of education._

#### Looking into the renaissance
As many historians have described it, the Renaissance Movement "was a fervent period of European cultural, artistic, political and economic “rebirth” **following the Middle Ages**.  Therefore, to understand the renaissance movement, it might help by starting to compare it to the middle ages. To make it a little interesting, let's continue to use art as a way to uncover what this whole movement was all about!

1. Spend 2-3 minutes looking at some art in [this virtual exhibit from the Medieval Period](https://artsandculture.google.com/partner/museu-episcopal-de-vic)
2. Then, spend another 2-3 minutes looking at some [art from the Renaissance Period](https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/renaissance/m06cvx?categoryid=art-movement)
3. Compare the art of the 2 periods, what do you notice? Try to take note of 2-3 things - it can be in terms of the subject of the art, the style? the color? etc.  

#### The two faces of humanism
- To give you a head start, here's a brief overview to set-up the context of the Renaissance Movement.
- **[What Was the Renaissance? AP Euro Bit by Bit #1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txKiku3qJN4)**
	- Renaissance means ==rebirth== and that's how intellectuals saw the time they were living in
	- Renaissance thinkers viewed the Middle Ages as a vast chasm that ==divided== them from the ==glory of the ancient world==
	- The Renaissance focused on a new appreciation of the ==abilities of the individual==, and along the way, this new focus created what we now recognize is the ==modern world==
- The early renaissance in Italy put much premium on ==personal culture, individual freedom, and development to attain a full life.== Hence, it was referred to as **[[Individual humanism]].**  
- The renaissance movement  that later on spread in northern Europe stressed social and moral reform as instrumental to achieving a meaningful life.  It was know as **[[Social humanism]].** 
- These two "types" of renaissance gave rise two educational systems. Read this excerpt to learn about the distinct features of these educational systems.

##### Discussion Board
In the discussion forum below, share:
1. **3 ideas** that caught your attention about individual or social humanism (label for alignment. Ex. Idea 1(individual). 
2. **2 "quotable quotes"** from the excerpt that you think captures the essence of the Renaissance's contribution to education.
3. **1 question** that you would like to pose to our learning community (either a point for clarification and/or a reflection question to help us connect to our current context).

**1. 3 IDEAS**
	1. Individual humanism: Students of Renaissance schools were exposed to three previously unknown aspects of life: the vibrant life of the past, the subjective world of the emotions, and the world of nature. 
	2. Individual humanism: Vittorino representing the advent of the professional teacher: pioneering the formulation of important doctrines, championing the development of interest and critical thinking, advocating for holistic development (e.g. importance of physical activity and play)
	3. Social humanism: The humanistic educators of the north proposed methods way ahead of their time, such as _The Liberal Education of Children_ and _The Method of Study_. 
**2. 2 QUOTES**
	1. Individual humanism: "Sufficient motivation was to be found in the fact that the higher posts of honor and activity in the life of the times were open only to those who had been thoroughly trained in the humanistic manner." (p. 168)
	2. Social humanism: "Where the child doth well, let the master praise him and say, 'Here ye do well,' for there is no such whetstone to sharpen a hard wit and encourage a will to learning, as is praise." (p. 172)
**3. 1 QUESTION:** "How exactly did broad humanism transition into 'Ciceronianism' (did it naturally happen, or did something trigger it)?"
