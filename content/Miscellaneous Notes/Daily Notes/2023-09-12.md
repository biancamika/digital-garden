### Instructional Strategies: Designing Learning Experiences
#### Questions you can ask
- As a neo-teacher, these questions can guide you in choosing the appropriate instructional strategies that you can employ:
	- Who are my students?  (Age, Gender, Personality, Learning Style, etc)
	- What is their context? (economic status, culture, etc)
	- What are some logistical set-up that I must consider? (wifi-bandwidth, classroom set-up, class size, class schedule, etc)
	- What type of "Learning" do I want to happen in class?  (Smith and Ragan, 2005)
	- What activities can I do with my students?  (William Horton, 2012)
	- What questions will I ask to deepen the learning that I want to happen?
- Recent questions that I now ask is:
	- What is the modality of teaching?  Is it face to face?  Online?  Or blended?
	- What activities will engage my students?
- As you stay longer in the field of teaching and begin gaining experience, you may ask additional questions like:
	- What worked the last time that is worth repeating?
	- What new strategies am I willing to try out?
- In a way, preparing for a lesson is like cooking, let say, Rice.  
	- It depends on what type of rice ==(objective)== you want to make:  plain, Chinese Fried Rice, Maki, Gimbap, or Paella.  
	- Then you need to consider the taste of the people who will eat ==(students and their context)== and the ingredients that you have on hand ==(logistical set-up)== and how you will present this so that your customers will want to try it.  
	- For new teachers, you might want to try the easiest way of cooking rice and this is by using a rice cooker.  As you get better, then you can proceed to cooking fried rice, rice rolls onto paella.
#### Gagne’s 9 Events of Instruction
Before delving into what teaching strategies we can use for our lessons in class, it might be good to look at what happens in class.  According to Robert Gagne, an American educational psychologist best know for his works on Conditions of Learning, there are 9 events that happen in a class.  

1. **Gain attention**: Obtain students’ attention so that they will watch and listen while the instructor presents the learning content.
	1. Present a story or a problem to be solved
	2. Utilize ice breaker activities, current news and events, case studies, YouTube videos, and so on. The objective is to quickly grab student attention and interest in the topic
	3. Utilize technologies such as clickers, and surveys to ask leading questions prior to lecture, survey opinion, or gain a response to a controversial question
2. **Inform learner of objectives**: Allow students to organize their thoughts regarding what they are about to see, hear, and/or do.
	1. Include learning objectives in lecture slides, the syllabus, and in instructions for activities, projects and papers
	2. Describe required performance
	3. Describe criteria for standard performance
3. **Stimulate recall of prior knowledge**:
	1. Help students make sense of new information by relating it to something they already know or something they have already experienced.
	2. Recall events from previous lecture, integrate results of activities into the current topic, and/or relate previous information to the current topic
	3. Ask students about their understanding of previous concepts
4. **Present new content**: Utilise a variety of methods including lecture, readings, activities, projects, multimedia, and others.
	1. Sequence and chunk the information to avoid cognitive overload
	2. Blend the information to aid in information recall
	3. Bloom's Revised Taxonomy can be used to help sequence the lesson by helping you chunk them into levels of difficulty
5. **Provide guidance**: Advise students of strategies to aid them in learning content and of resources available. With learning guidance, the rate of learning increases because students are less likely to lose time or become frustrated by basing performance on incorrect facts or poorly understood concepts.
	1. Provide instructional support as needed – as scaffolds (cues, hints, prompts) which can be removed after the student learns the task or content
	2. Model varied learning strategies – mnemonics, concept mapping, role playing, visualizing
	3. Use examples and non-examples
6. **Practice**: Allow students to apply knowledge and skills learned.
	1. Allow students to apply knowledge in group or individual activities
	2. Ask deep-learning questions, make reference to what students already know or have students collaborate with their peers
	3. Ask students to recite, revisit, or reiterate information they have learned
	4. Facilitate student elaborations – ask students to elaborate or explain details and provide more complexity to their responses
7. **Provide feedback**: Provide immediate feedback of students’ performance to assess and facilitate learning.
	1. Consider using group / class level feedback (highlighting common errors, give examples or models of target performance, show students what you do not want)
	2. Consider implementing peer feedback
	3. Require students to specify how they used feedback in subsequent works
8. **Assess performance**: To evaluate the effectiveness of the instructional events, test to see if the expected learning outcomes have been achieved. Performance should be based on previously stated objectives.
	1. Utilize a variety of assessment methods including exams/quizzes, written assignments, projects, and so on
9. **Enhance retention and transfer**: Allow students to apply information to personal contexts. This increases retention by personalising information.
	1. Provide opportunities for students to relate course work to their personal experiences
	2. Provide additional practice

#### Smith and Ragan - Types of Learning
Smith and Ragan (2005) shared with us 9 Types of Learning that happen in class and suggests instructional strategies that goes with each.  Let's take time out and consider them.
1.  **Declarative Knowledge** is also known as verbal information and has three kinds: labels/names, facts/list, and organized discourse.  Some instructional strategies we can use to enhance this type of learning are:  using mnemonic techniques, establishing connections, and practicing.
2.  **Concept Learning** involves the ability to apply knowledge across a variety of instances or circumstances.  Some instructional strategies include explaining, giving examples, and practicing skills of generalizing.
3. **Learning Procedures** includes the step by step knowledge before arriving at an answer or a solution.  This can include executing of a particular psychomotor skill like dribbling a basketball or arriving at a solution for a math problem.  Strategies given here are practice and giving feedbacks.
4. **Principle Learning** prescribes relationships which are often described in the form of If....then or cause...effect.  Some learning strategies suggested here are reflection, hands on practice, examples from prior experiences.
5. **Problem Solving** is the ability to combine previously learned principles, declarative knowledge, procedures and cognitive strategies in a unique way to solve a previously unencountered problem.   Strategies suggested here are:  forming well-defined and clear problems, alternate ways of presenting the problem, tapping on relevant prior knowledge, providing of mental or visual aids.
6. **Cognitive Strategies** are techniques that learners use to control and monitor their won cognitive processes.  These are mental tactics for attending to: organizing, elaborating, manipulating, and retrieving knowledge which lead to discovery, invention, and creativity.  Divergent thinking strategies like employing various solutions option to deal with the problem, selfrategies -instructional training, or direct instructions may be used.
7. **Attitude Learning**  is not often explicitated in the LOs.  There are instances though that we want to form or change attitudes such as:  LBGT acceptance, valuing Catholic traditions and practices and the like.  Instructional strategies like self-reflection, observation, input and role modeling can be practiced.
8. **Psychomotor Skill Learning** is characterized by coordinated muscular movements.  This learning is often complemented by Procedural learning and instructional strategies like practicing, watching tutorial videos, and feedback giving are often used.
9. **Integration of Types of Learning** includes combination of 2 or more types of learning. Strategies include collaborative learning, drawing from previous knowledge among others.

#### Absorb-Do-Connect Activities
- Here are more ideas for activities that can be used and implemented in the class.   Taken from William Horton's E-Learning by Design, we can choose activities that suit the needs of our learners.
- According to Horton, there are 3 categories of activities:  Absorb-Do-Connect.  Each category serves a specific purpose depending on what the teacher wants the learners to achieve at the end of the class/module.

#### Discovering Instructional Strategies
- There are tons of resources and literature written on Instructional Strategy.  Here are two resources which you can view to give you more ideas.
	- [Marzano's High Yield Instructional Strategies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lQFbu8h8k4&t=419s)    - Robert Marzano is a well known American Educational Researcher.  He has done massive work on Assessment and Instructional Strategies.  View this video to get a general idea of his work.
	- [32 Research-Based Instructional Strategies for Teachers](https://www.teachthought.com/pedagogy/32-research-based-instructional-strategies/)    - a quick reference page on strategies that teachers can easily use.  I encourage you to click on the related resources given on each of the strategy.
