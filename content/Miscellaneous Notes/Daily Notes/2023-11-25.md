## Sports and the Athlete
### Individual Report

#### Prompt
- Choose 3 to 4 milestones or important events/times in your spiritual journey in sports. For each milestone, identify the milestone and its meaning for your journey (Junior High up to Present).
- Examples:
	- ACL while junior varsity volleyball player in Senior High School: I lost self-confidence and wanted to quit the team, but my coaches and teammates gave me support.
	- First time I watched a live football game in the US while a teenager: I was overwhelmed by the entire atmosphere and I resolved I wanted to be an athlete. 
- Trace your spiritual journey through the milestones and make sure the last milestone is where you are now.
- Words: 1000-1500
#### Report
##### Outline
- Intro: 
	- whenever dance is considered as a sport, I don't consider myself to be a very good athlete...
	- most of  my milestones are failures
	- The practice of sport is tied to risk...sense has to be made of failure as much as success
		- these failures have become milestones
- not making it into HS compet team 3 years in a row. got a pep talk from coach
- Pandemic: joined 3 competitions for my dance studio. got awards but they didn't feel impactful for me?
- A.Y. 2022-2023: 
	- not making it into compet lineup + street division
	- won my first battle (group)
- present: 
	- not making it into compet lineup + street division
	- confiding in my coach
	- deciding to let go of the dream
	- how did i move on?
- Conclusion:
	- spirituality as a journey
	- serenity prayer..."serenity to accept the things that I cannot change"
	- “If you could go back and fix all the mistakes you’ve made, you’d erase yourself.”
	- Alpha Waymond’s words to Evelyn in _Everything Everywhere All at Once_: “Every rejection, every disappointment, has led you to this moment.”
	- "It is better to fail in pursuit of the extraordinary than to succeed pursuing average"

Outline for spiritual milestones:
- talk about the milestone
- talk about the meaning you found in it

##### Writing
Whenever dance is considered a sport, defined by the zero-sum nature of competition, I wouldn't consider myself to be a great athlete at all. I was barely able to experience winning, much less competing — in fact, more often than not, I didn't make it into the competition lineup of my school. But according to Robinson (2007), athletes often have to deal with such risk; therefore, they must make sense of their failures as much as their wins.
