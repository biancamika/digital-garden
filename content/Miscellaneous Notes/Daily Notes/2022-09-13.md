### Tambay sa Pancitan

*Tambay sa Pancitan: Luzon's Ysla de Panciteria Project_ (2021)*

> Share a screenshot of one scene or moment from the webinar. In a few sentences, explain to us why this image stood out for you.

This scene stood out me because I find it to be such a well-designed breakdown of the *pancit*'s multifaceted significance. Before this webinar, I only saw the *pancit* as a staple homemade dish to be eaten, and nothing else. But now, I'm aware of all the roles it serves in our culture, whether it be economically or spiritually (fields that I thought were disconnected from cuisine!). This was definitely enlightening for me.

### Culture ingested
> In understanding Philippine design, it is important to familiarize yourself with the idea of ==cultural hybridity (mestizaje)==. We are a very culturally diverse nation, and had endured several colonial regimes. This has a significant impact on the subjectivity that we form, both as individuals and as a people. In this module, we look at a creative field that is rich but also often overlooked: gastronomy.

> Whether on your own, or in your family or circle of friends, have you observed any particular food-related quirks or traditions which makes you feel at home? Think about it (or ask around a bit): how did this start and what conditions gave rise to it?

Tradition: I noticed that most of the women in my family (both sides) go overboard when it comes to feeding me and my siblings at home. My mom constantly overorders food whenever we go out, even in spite of complaints (because she's a careless spender). My tita always buys way too much snacks (e.g. chips and chocolates) whenever she goes grocery shopping, despite my requests to tone it down (it amazes me how she's a doctor yet advocates for so much processed foods). My lola frequently sends homemade delicacies to our house, my favorite of hers being strawberries and cream. To be honest, I've hated (and perhaps still hate) how obsessed all of them seemed to be with food; as someone trying to lose weight, I thought that these traditions were detrimental to me. I couldn't help thinking: "Why are they always trying to sabotage my progress?"

Of course, I know they mean well. Now, I understand that gift-giving is one of their main love languages, and they show this through enthusiastically feeding me and my siblings. Reflecting on their lives, I can assume that this came to be because of how they grew up. My lola came from a life of poverty, where her next meal wasn't always guaranteed. My aunt's parents' managed and grew a popular restaurant, so she grew up valuing food (after all, it physically and financially sustained her family). My mom had distant parents: her mother was the neglectful type, while her father was oceans away, working as an OFW; despite the physical distance, he made up for it through constant providing, whether it be tuition or balikbayan boxes (much of which was filled with treats). Despite the differences in their upbringings, they all ended up appreciating food. And because they find worth in food, they make use of it as a way to show love.
