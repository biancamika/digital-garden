## Startupy
Hi Sari! Sorry for not getting back to you these past few months. I've been delayed by a lot of difficulties in my personal life, along with excruciating perfectionism; it took me forever to not only figure out what topic I wanted to share, but also select the best resources to feature. I hope the effort I put into answering these questions makes up for it, though! Thank you again for the opportunity :)

### Questions
**Topic Name:**
- Non-Western Product and Service Design
- Or Cross-Cultural Design

**Why is XX topic interesting?** (100-150 words)
When I was getting started with product and service design, I was stuck in a Western bubble; the practitioners I first looked up to tended to be white males, while the platforms I would refer to as examples usually came from Silicon Valley.  However, design isn't fully universal; just because an app succeeds in America doesn't mean it'll do as well in Southeast Asia. A significant chunk of Internet users belong to the Majority World/Global South, yet there is so little we know about them. As a Filipino woman myself, I struggled to figure out how to adapt my design practice to my own local context, and I feel like I'm still learning. Hence why I want to advocate for this topic. I have compiled resources on how to practice cross-cultural design alongside various examples of technology in non-Western countries.
  

**A podcast worth listening to on the topic?**  (with 1-2 sentences on why)
I highly recommend [Traces](https://open.spotify.com/show/29LXWjJOJoBmaEaMevtvi6?si=1179809d99bf41ce): a podcast that dissects how technology and design impacts culture in developing countries (currently focused on Myanmar).

**Things worth reading and watching on the topic?** (with 1-2 sentences on why)
First, here are some of the books I find essential:
- [Cross-Cultural Design](https://abookapart.com/products/cross-cultural-design): Designer and creative director Senongo Akpem shares a clear and accessible methodology for designing across cultures: from performing socially conscious research, to building culturally responsive experiences, to developing meaningful internationalization and localization approaches.
- [The Next Billion Users](https://www.amazon.com/Next-Billion-Users-Digital-Beyond/dp/0674983785): Digital anthropologist Payal Arora invalidates  multiple assumptions about internet use in developing countries by sharing insights from her extensive fieldwork in India, China, South Africa, Brazil, and the Middle East.
Next, here are some of the online resources I constantly refer to:
- [Web Design Across the World](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/series/web-design-across-the-world--cms-1038):  This series of articles exposes global web culture, technology, education, and design, one country at a time.
- [Inclusive Design in Southeast Asia](https://www.projectlima.co/inclusive-design-southeast-asia/): This study explores how far Southeast Asia organizations incorporate inclusiveness and accessibility into their digital products.
Finally, a case study that has left a big impact on me is [Designing for Developing Markets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unCYqNmg7tI): a talk where Jay Demetillo, Lead Product Designer of Grab, shows how he strategizes, researches, and designs for different regions, discussing everything from ideologies to design systems.
	
**Projects worth following on the topic?** (with 1-2 sentences on why)
Two projects that I'm excited by so far are:
- [Chamjo](https://chamjo.design/): Created by an all-Indonesian team, this Mobbin-inspired collection consists of design patterns used by Asia-based apps. 
- [AI in/from the Majority World](https://points.datasociety.net/ai-in-the-global-south-sites-and-vocabularies-e3b67d631508): This project by Data & Society invigorates existing efforts to reframe the "Global South" as home to the majority of the human population, while aiming to understand the diverse ethics, politics, and everyday experiences of living with data and AI. So far, this project has come up with a primer on various jargons and an anthology of parables. 

Aside from these, I have also gained unique insights from the following publications:
- [Rest of World](https://restofworld.org/): a global nonprofit publication covering technology beyond the Western bubble.
- [Chaoyang Trap](https://chaoyangtrap.house/): a newsletter about everyday life on the Chinese internet
