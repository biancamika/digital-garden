### Biological Processes 
#### Bodies and Body Horror
> When we speak of **Biological Processes** as a module in this class, we are referring specifically to reproduction, sex, and gender, as well as parasites and pathogens: in other words, the way we screw, and the ways we get screwed. (We have to establish this now, because otherwise "biological processes" as a term essentially refers to the entire class.) And when we speak of these topics, what we _really_ mean to talk about is the body, and the ways in which science fiction upholds and subverts our expectations about how the body is supposed to work.

##### Sex, Gender, and Reproduction
- We know from our previous discussions that we often equate "normality" with ==proximity to what we consider the human norm==: the closer a science fiction alien is to what we call a "normal" human body, the more familiar and less strange we find it. 
	- We know buglike aliens, being rather far from the human shape, are often depicted as exceedingly bizarre and unknowable, while rubber forehead aliens--the species that populate works like _Star Trek_--are often seen as potential allies, or at the very least opponents that might be willing to negotiate. 
- Often these distinctions apply to ==the biological processes that control these creatures' bodies==: human-shaped "friendly" aliens often also have two biological sexes and corresponding genders.
	- E.G. How do we discern if an alien is "male" or "female"? What does the question of gender even mean for aliens? And how can we come up with an instinctive answer anyways?
- One assumption on which much of our society is based is the idea that ==one's reproductive biology is a determinant of one's identity and social role:== people with Y chromosomes are biologically male, and thus are men, who are then expected to behave in particular ways, and the same is true for people with XX chromosomes who are expected to behave in conventionally feminine ways. 
	- Apart from both erasing intersex people and ignoring people who are transgender or otherwise gender-nonconforming, this assumption falls prey to that most common of human biases: we assume it's the only framework out there. 
	- We can forget that **gender identity and gender expression are largely social constructs**, ones that are not inherent or assigned or automatically paired with the biological characteristics with which they are often associated--something many people on Earth already know. 
- There are so many creatures on Earth for whom sex and reproduction work vastly differently than they do for us. Assuming such creatures (or aliens sharing their characteristics) even had concepts of gender identity, **who's to say their reproductive biology would correspond neatly to their concepts of gender--or would even allow for gender identity in the same way that ours does?**
- Consider the asari of _Mass Effect_: a single-sex species of aliens who reproduce more or less ==parthenogenetically==: they can initiate (psychic) sexual intercourse with a counterpart of almost any sentient species of any sex, preferring non-asari to asari, and the child will be carried by the asari and will always be an asari. 
	- The asari look and sound like blue versions of human women, and they all use female pronouns, with their stages of development being named using feminine terms: maiden, matron, and matriarch. 
	- If the species is single-sex, why are they designed with a culture that seems so very feminine and female-inflected, from a human perspective, when part of the way we define femininity, culturally speaking, is in conversation with masculinity? 
	- And just to add another layer to all this, _Mass Effect_ seems aware of how strange this is and willing to deconstruct it: the _Mass Effect_ games equip the (human) player character with a universal translator, which automatically translates alien languages into English. When the human-female-looking asari use female pronouns, those are not necessarily _their_ words; that's the universal translator translating their language into English. **What does gender mean, then, to them, and will we ever really be able to find out?**
- Science fiction provides opportunities to question a lot of the norms around which we're used to living our lives, and ==biological sex--and the social constructs that we build around it--is no exception.== Sci-fi allows us to imagine aliens that take our assumptions about how sex, gender, and reproduction work and flip them on their heads, creating **new status quos and new norms** that implicitly always question the way we see things in "the real world."
	- And that's before we even talk about parasites and pathogens.

##### Parasites, Pathogens, and Body Horror
- If science fiction can defamiliarize sex, gender, and reproduction in order to create _nova_ which present us with alternative definitions for "normal," the genre can also defamiliarize parasites and pathogens to present the opposite: **estranged, hyperbolized versions of *ab*normality**. Both in real life and in science fiction, ==infections are essentially what happens when "normal" bodily function is subverted by a foreign organism or agent, often one that seeks to use the body for its own purposes.== In real life, this can manifest as a disease or physical malady; in science fiction, this can be ==hyperbolized into terrifying infestations, mutations, or extreme physical plagues or symptoms.==
- If sex, gender, and reproduction can be defamiliarized to ==interrogate our definitions of desire and the body==, then parasites and pathogens are often defamiliarized to ==incite fear.== Most common science fiction parasites and pathogens operate in **transformation storylines,** which focus on the ==corruption of the human form==--whether quickly or slowly--into something inhuman and terrifying. 
	- These are old stories, taking the tradition of mythic curse narratives and bringing them into the realm of alien infestations and zombie viruses. 
	- The horror is in seeing how some of our primal human fears are ==hyperbolized== and given ==physical form== in fictional afflictions which use scientific ideas to tap into real human terrors.
- When you look at the vampire, for example, the obvious observation is that it's a bloodsucking undead monster whose bite can transform others into creatures like itself. 
	- Depending on what texts you're reading, this can be classic fantasy as well as archetypal science fiction, hyperbolizing the idea of a virus and turning it into a curse that bestows great power at the cost of humanity. 
	- But when you look at how vampires work, they drain bodily fluids (i.e. blood) from victims at night, often after ambushing or coercing said victims, and sometimes turn their victims by feeding them some of their own bodily fluids in turn (again, blood).
- Add to that the fact that many older vampire stories were either about sinners or foreigners, and the fear that the vampire curse (as delivered by sinners and foreigners) might corrupt innocent young women and turn them into unclean monsters, and you start to get the idea that ==vampires are also an allegory for sex, and the human fascination with and fear of sex.== 
	- There's something erotic about feeding, something the Bela Lugosi era of vampire movies was able to emphasize, and so our pop culture today sees vampires as "the hot monster," despite the earliest movie vampire, Nosferatu (itself an attempt at adapting _Dracula_) being an decidedly unsexy bat creature. 
	- The vampire today is _largely_ ==a sign that estranges sexual desire==, hyperbolizing both its compelling and its terrifying elements, casting it as a monstrous curse that changes those it touches forever. (Or, you know, a sparkly emo teenager.)
- This is the logic of science fiction parasites and pathogens: ==the fear of the body, which as we've seen is a signifier for normality, being turned against us.== As this year has proven, we link the normal functioning of our human bodies very closely to a sense of normality in the world (rightly or wrongly), and so the belief that there might be a fantastic agent out there that might be able to subvert our bodies towards its own inhuman ends? Terrifying as hell, and very much the subject of a lot of science fiction.
- Sir Ron's Notes: **[Episode 10 - Body Horror: An Introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mucw86qNVSM)**

#### Sci-Fi Sex
- When we first defined evolution, we emphasized that for a trait to be subject to evolutionary forces, it must be _heritable_. We've also talked about how _fitness_ is an important element in the evolution of a population, particularly when it's evolution through natural selection. Both of these show us how important reproduction is in biology. ==It not only ensures the continuation of a genetic lineage but increases the number of individuals making up a population.== Both genetic variability and large population size make a population less prone to extinction.
- So yes, reproduction is of absolute importance for life-forms. In fact, we can argue that ==to survive to reproductive age and be able to reproduce (essentially, to be _fit_) is the most important inherent drive of organisms.== We can most likely expect the same in alien species.
- Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED3kMKUwxXQ) for an overview of sex and reproduction on Earth and how it illuminates certain common sex-related tropes in sci-fi.
- So there's a lot of interesting stuff going out there both on our real planet and on fictional ones! Whatever the method and how ever bizarre it is, ==the ultimate goal is to transmit the genetic material from one generation to the next.== 
	- On Earth, casual sex without the goal of procreation is rare; aside from humans and some primates, only dolphins are known to do that. 
	- But we can generally expect that ==the higher the consciousness and cognition levels of the alien species, the more common that non-procreative sex will be.==
- **Sexual selection**  is an important evolutionary force that shapes organisms, usually (but not always) the males of species. This is the main reason for **sexual dimorphism**, which is the ==condition wherein the two sexes are anatomically different.== 
	- In most species, particularly in animals, the female makes the choice and so has to be attracted by the males, which compete with each other to get the female. This means that the ==evolutionary pressure to be attractive is stronger on males than on females==, thus the evolution of traits like large body size, bright feathers, loud songs, etc. 
	- This is largely because in most species, it's the male that benefits from having multiple sexual partners. Think about it: a male that has sex with five females within one mating period can produce offspring from all five, but a female that has sex with five males within one mating period will produce only one batch of offspring from one male. Thus, ==males spend more time looking for mates than taking care of young==, making paternal care generally uncommon.
	- _Can you think of sci-fi races that show this type of dichotomy between males and females?_
- These roles can be flipped in several species, of course. 
	- Think of the seahorse, whose males carry the young in their pouches. In those species, it's the female that courts and has sex with several partners and it's the male that takes care of the young. 
	- Understandably, sci-fi is even more adventurous when it comes to defying conventions in sex and gender. In Ursula Le Guin's Hainish Cycle, particularly in the novel _The Left Hand of Darkness_, the natives of Gethen are both male and female at once most of the time, except for a few days every month when they become sexually receptive and adopt the sexual attributes of male or female (and it may change from month to month!). 
	- _The Orville_'s Moclans have a sexual divide that's explained as much by social politics as by biology; only males are legitimate citizens because of rigid social norms but also because somehow, two males are able to produce offspring! 
		- As _The Martian_ author Andy Weir has speculated online, that probably means that the egg-laying Moclan is actually intersex (having both male and female structures functional), which might actually be the common sexual state in the species after the females were exiled from their society. 
	- Gender and sexual roles in sci-fi can definitely teach us a thing or two about ==how diverse they are in human society and how important it is for us to make an effort to understand them.==
	- The _Star Trek_universe, ever the bellwether on diversity and inclusivity, recently celebrated the casting of a non-binary actor and a trans actor in _Star Trek: Discovery_, which in many other ways has shown itself to be the most biologically progressive installment in the franchise.
- Sex can be messy. 
	- In SF/horror hybrids like the _Alien_ franchise, the gene-editing films _Splice_ and _Species_, and the Cronenberg body horror staples (particularly _The Brood_), females can be as deadly as the Earth spider and insect females that eat males after sex. Just think about the Ardat-Yakshi of _Mass Effect_. 
	- The "monstrous-feminine" has been a common and oft-studied trope in horror and sci-fi that has horror elements. 
	- Conversely, you have dysfunctional males like Freddy, Jason, and Michael whose true horror story from a biological perspective is that they are abominably warped men (physically and psychologically) who will not be found conventionally attractive.

**Points for Discussion**
1. Is it reasonable to assume that reproduction is as important in alien life as it is on Earth? Why or why not?
2. What are the advantages of parthenogenesis over sexual reproduction? Why isn't it more common on Earth despite these advantages?
3. If aberrant sexual morphologies and/or behaviors are _nova_, what could they be signifying? Give specific examples.

#### "Bloodchild" - Kid Pro Quo
- "Bloodchild" by Octavia Butler is Ridley Scott's _Alien_ franchise as an almost-wholesome dark mpreg fic, and it baffles me that I am completely serious about that entire string of words. 
	- Drawing on the traditions of body horror, the coming-of-age story, and social science fiction, it revolves around a human boy, Gan, who lives in a human settlement on a planet dominated by the Tlic, a sapient species of large buglike aliens who have a matriarchal society and a parasitic mode of reproduction. 
	- The humans and the Tlic have an arrangement: the Tlic protect and maintain the human reservations, and in exchange human families promise their male children to Tlic women to serve as hosts for their eggs in a process that is (usually?) not dangerous.
- Coming-of-age texts are about ==gaining maturity at the cost of innocence: the loss of some illusion or comfort from childhood.== 
	- Here, Gan struggles with the decision of whether or not to fulfill the duty to which his family has committed him: hosting the eggs of his Tlic intended, T'Gatoi, an influential politician and administrator. 
	- T'Gatoi is in a position of prominence, and also is a large and terrifying (but not necessarily unkind!) bug creature, all things that represent a kind of danger, ==an inequality== between Gan and T'Gatoi. 
	- Moreover, T'Gatoi claims that she needs to lay her eggs in someone, and if Gan does not follow up on the commitment to host her eggs, she might lay them in his younger sister instead, as Terran females are supposedly even better hosts for Tlic eggs even if they are not offered as such due to the (supposedly small) risk to the host. 
	- If the process goes wrong, or if the Tlic larvae hatch and are not extracted in time, they might begin to eat the host from the inside, and losing a human female in this way would hurt both the humans (as they would have lost a daughter) and the Tlic (as they would have lost a potential mother for the next generation of Terrans and Tlic egg hosts alike).
	- Suffice it to say, Gan is scared as hell.
- "Bloodchild" is a story about the ==subversion of gender roles.== This is, ultimately, a story about male pregnancy, of course, but there are many other aspects to Gan's and T'Gatoi's relationship--a synecdoche for the Terran-Tlic arrangement--that further reinforce this theme. 
	- T'Gatoi exudes an aggressive, arguably masculine energy; Tlic eggs are deposited into Terran males via the ovipositor, an organ strongly coded with phallic symbolism. Moreover, T'Gatoi is in a position of power over Gan, both physically and politically, something echoed by all of Tlic society: most leadership roles seem to go to Tlic women, whereas Tlic men are dismissed and Terran men are made into spouses. 
	- And Gan, for his part, spends much of the story reacting rather than enacting--even when he considers running away, it is a potential act of defiance against a role and a system that have previously been thrust upon him, rather than a decision to do something completely new. His arc is inward, emotional, and circumscribed by relationships, in a way typically associated with women in traditional patriarchy-fueled Western writing.
- Furthermore, while the Terrans are colonists on the Tlic world, their position is not that of the standard European colonizer: they, and not the Tlic, live in reservations, and it is the Tlic who seem to retain power over the land. 
	- The role of recipient--the person to whom things are done--is often feminized and exoticized in the colonial setup, but here, these traits are given primarily to the Terrans, despite the fact that the main point of interface (heh) between Terrans and Tlic is in the relationships between Tlic women and Terran males. 
	- "Bloodchild" is an excellent example of social science fiction, the sort whose _novum_ includes ==heightens, subverts, and otherwise affects social fabric==, and whose preoccupation with its _novum_ includes focusing on the ==society that contextualizes it.==
- I say "males" rather than "men" deliberately, largely because Gan here is still quite young, whereas T'Gatoi is coded as a grown woman. Here we see another interesting layer to their relationship: that of the child spouse promised to an older person, another role that is often feminized but which here is flipped on its head. 
	- The multiple layers of imbalance, coupled with the very deliberate choice to use Gan as the point of view, mean that reading this text will always have a certain level of ambiguity: while Gan does make a decision at the climax, and while we do see the process that leads up to his decision, there will always be the question of whether we view it, ultimately, as a free choice or not. (For that matter, given his age, do we think he is even capable of consent in this situation?)
- To further emphasize the ambiguity of _Bloodchild_ by way of counterexample, let's detour into a mini-**Creature Spotlight**, and talk for a bit about arguably the most famous human-incubated bug alien of all time, the xenomorph from _**Alien**_. 
	- Here, the horror is unambiguous--the creature's anatomy, both as a facehugger and as an adult xenomorph, is so evocative of human anatomy, combining shapes reminiscent of sex organs, hands, and so on, but these are estranged to the point that they are horrific and frightening. 
	- The way the facehugger "impregnates" the human victim isn't just subversive, as with the Tlic; the facehugger is coercive and violent, smothering the victim's face with its finger-like legs in a way that ==semiotically hides their face, erasing their personhood and reducing them to a body and an incubator for a violent, monstrous progeny.== 
	- And the way the adult xenomorph hunts its victims is methodical, calculated, reminiscent of stalking in the worst way. There is clearly ==no consent== here; the relationship between humans and xenomorphs is terrifying, harmful, and destructive.
- In contrast, _Bloodchild_ is far more ambiguous in how it wants us to read it. It's kind about sex, but it also isn't. It's kind of about body horror, but it also isn't. And one of the most interesting questions is whether or not, given all of this, we can truly call this a love story. 
	- It seems like Gan and T'Gatoi truly do care about each other, but ==given the power imbalance at play, are they ever truly able to speak as equals?== How is this affected by the fact that T'Gatoi needs Gan too? And does any of this even matter? 
	- This ambiguity is another thing we see echoed in the relationship between the Tlic and the Terrans as well, a pact that is as uncomfortable as it is workable--which, indeed, probably describes many more relationships than we'd like to admit.
- **Sir Ron's Note:**
	- What the T'lic do (i.e. depositing their eggs into other organisms) is a common behavior in many insect species, particularly wasps. These are **parasitoids**. 
	- Female wasps use an extension of their abdomen called (just like in the story) the **ovipositor** to inject their eggs into aphids and bugs and other insects, all unsuspecting because the process tends to involve an anesthetic. 
	- By the time the insects realize that they've been serving as living incubators, it's too late; when the eggs hatch, the larvae literally eat their way out of the host's body, killing it. The similarities with T'lic behavior are uncanny but likely not coincidental.

**Discussion Points**
1.  How does "Bloodchild" display cognition and estrangement/defamiliarization when it comes to patriarchal society and/or relationships informed by patriarchy?
2.  Why do you think the Tlic are designed the way they are?
3.  Discuss the relationship between the Terrans and the Tlic. Do you think it's fair? Do you think it's equitable? Do you think it's just?
4.  Would you call this a love story? Why or why not?
5.  Use the dichotomous key in Module 2 to try to classify the Tlic using Earth-based systems.

#### Creature Spotlight: The Moclans
- Continuing our apparent subtheme of Dudes Who Give Birth, let's turn our attention now to the episode of _The Orville_ titled "Sanctuary." _The Orville_ is a dramedy science fiction show created by and starring (in live-action!) Seth MacFarlane, who in this show proves that he's way more than just the _Family Guy_ guy. Together, MacFarlane as Captain Ed Mercer and a competent, diverse, weird-as-hell ensemble crew fly the USS Orville on behalf of the Planetary Union, in a show that began as "the _Family Guy_ guy tries to ape _Star Trek_" but by its second season develops into a series that builds on a lot of the nuance, heart, and spirit of shows like _Star Trek: The Next Generation_. (You can see why we'd want to give this to you after "The Chase.")
- The episode titled "Sanctuary" focuses on the Moclans, an overwhelmingly uni-gendered and homosexual species represented on the Orville by Lieutenant Commander Bortus, his husband Klyden, and their son Topa, who came out of a very large egg that Bortus laid in season 1. The earlier episode in which Topa hatched, "About A Girl," revealed that Topa was originally female, something thought incredibly unlikely and aberrant to the greater bulk of Moclan society, and "About A Girl" focused on whether or not the child should undergo a "corrective" procedure to become--and thus be raised--male. Notably, the procedure went through, despite Bortus' eventual disapproval and desire to raise his child the way they were born (an early hint that _The Orville_ was going to be more than fart jokes in space), a desire which brought him into conflict with his more conservative husband, Klyden, and set up one of the oft-repeated moral lessons of the show: Klyden is a huge jerk.
- Then we get to "Sanctuary," an episode that builds on and expands the themes of "About A Girl," and _oh boy._ This episode offers answers and questions alike about Moclan society, explores what happens when culture, history, realpolitik, the music of Dolly Parton, and the stubborn desire to make a better world all collide into each other, and shows that any historical reckoning with oppression is likely to be as messy as it is necessary (as well as reaffirming that, yes, Klyden is a huge jerk), while still being pretty funny and offering a surprising amount of heart and emotion when you least expect it.
- The crux of "Sanctuary": Topa isn't alone, and female Moclan births are far, far more common than most Moclans know, a fact that Moclan society desperately tries to cover up. The titular sanctuary refers to a hidden planet which has become a base of operations for a rebel group of female Moclans run by Heveena, a once-revered Moclan poet and scholar who was revealed in "About A Girl" to also be female. While many Moclans who find that their children are hatched as females do opt for the "corrective" surgery, as Klyden advocated, it turns out that many others instead bring their children to this sanctuary world where they can be raised the way they are. The discovery of this world sets off a chain of events that implicates Moclus, the rebel colony, the Planetary Union, and the entire crew of the Orville as they find themselves balancing the female Moclans' right and desire to exist as they are against the conservative bigotry of the Moclans, who themselves play an important role in galactic politics and whose disfavor might imperil the Union.
- The Moclans reflect an interesting estrangement of traditional norms around sex and gender in a different way from "Bloodchild": where that story presented an implicit role reversal, "Sanctuary" shows ==a forced attempt at erasing one gender completely, and the consequences of that for both sides of the equation.== Most Moclans are homosexual but also extremely bigoted, a combination that shows the very natural result of a conservative society in which they believe in only two genders, _normal_ and _female_. To further complicate matters, while "mainstream" Moclans self-identify as male, use male pronouns, and are treated by their fellow Union species as male, a biological reading suggests that according to our standards, male Moclans are probably technically female--but then, if mainstream Moclans think of themselves as male, and if all of galactic society sees them as male, and if even the members of the other sex whom they have tried to erase think of them as male and themselves as female, then does it even matter? ==The Moclans, having built a society that strictly reinforces the link between sex and gender _within_ the world of the text, are also, paradoxically, a _novum_ that completely subverts that link when it comes to our own _reading_ of the text.==
- (This also raises the question of whether male Moclans might be parthenogenetic, like deep-voiced dudebro whiptail lizards, as homosexual Moclan couples are fully capable of having offspring, or whether their sexual reproduction just works differently. This then leads to a further question: can Moclan _women_ conceive, and if so, with which sex do they need to mate for that to happen? Or does it not actually matter? Worth speculating.)
- **Sir Ron's Note:**
	- Moclan reproduction is really intriguing, if only because it's really difficult to understand it from an Earth perspective because is no known species of Earth life where the male's are parthenogenetic! This might a case of the writers wanting to make a statement on sex and gender and not really caring too much about the science of it. But I like Andy Weir's (writer of _The Martian_) theory on it: that the intersex condition, once not too common (but still more common in Moclans than in humans), was favored over time because they have gametes that can be fertilized and they can produce eggs, and so the genes for the intersex condition became more common over time! The science still isn't exactly sound, but it's the best explanation that I've heard.
	- _The Orville_, in the way it has developed and used the Moclans, gives us a great example of how a seemingly simple _novum_--a sapient, supposedly all-male species--can be, as Suvin says, =="developed with totalizing rigor," such that all the social implications make for a wealth of interesting complexities, contradictions, and stories.== And the Moclans themselves show us the ==dangers of a society founded on the idea of overbearing conformity to any identity and the subsequent marginalization and erasure of all others.== But most of all, they show us how ==these ideals that we assume to be unshakable are often in fact constructed and arbitrary, and how sometimes all it takes is sustained, thorough examination and inquiry==--perhaps with a little help from a song--to imagine something different.

**Discussion Questions**
1.  Explore the ways in which Moclan culture displays cognition and estrangement in relation to the traditional gender binary.
2.  Discuss the Planetary Union's compromise at the end of the episode. What factors are they weighing, what does their proposed solution achieve, and could there have been a better one? 
3.  Talk about the Dolly Parton reference. What was it doing there, what significance does it have, and did it make you feel feelings?
4.  Fellas, is it [Moclan society] gay?

#### "Coming of Age in Karhide": It's Kemmer Time
- "Coming of Age in Karhide" is a deceptively simple story about Sov Thade Tage em Ereb, a fourteen-year-old Gethenian about to undergo their first kemmer. Kemmering is the _novum_ at the heart of the story; it's the monthly process in which most Gethenians become fertile and express a particular gender (not always the same one each time, for most of them) for a short period, similar to the estrous cycle of female dogs and cats.
	- The kemmer cycle and its implications inform many parts of Gethenian society--from their family structures and social mores to the literal structures they build around it, such as the Fastness and the iconic kemmerhouse--and one's first kemmer, in particular, is seen as a significant moment, a moment of celebration and transition into adulthood.
- This is the central conflict of the story: Sov's first kemmer, but more importantly, them dealing with their anxieties around kemmering (as well as the physical symptoms, of course). It's a small, domestic story, but one that explains a lot about the Gethenians' culture, which I think is by design. 
	- A coming-of-age story, as we previously talked about, is anchored primarily on gaining maturity and losing innocence, but that need not always be as fraught a loss as Gan's in "Bloodchild"--here, innocence also takes the form of the childhood fears that Sov holds about kemmering and the stories that they, Sether, and their peers have heard. 
	- But as Sov goes through the story and experiences their first kemmer, they find that kemmer is not something to be feared, but something natural and even beautiful, and the story is their way of sharing that beauty with their audience.
- This is also ==a story about language==; it's a story that very much calls attention to the fact that it _is_ a story being told by someone. There's a key paragraph on the second page that goes:
> "I have already had some trouble trying to tell this story in a language that has no somer pronouns, only gendered pronouns. In their last years of kemmer, as the hormone balance chances, many people tend to go into kemmer as men; Dory's kemmers had been male for over a year, so I'll call Dory "he," although of course the point was that he would never be either he or she again."
- This one paragraph accomplishes many things. It reminds us that Sov is narrating this in a language that isn't theirs; this is something being translated for our benefit. 
	- It reminds us that the human-centric default is something to which Sov is actively adjusting for the sake of telling us this story, and that ==our experience and language not universal and cannot be expected to be universal.== 
	- This emphasis on the story being something Sov is actively telling in a language other than their own also further reinforces its status as something intended, in-universe, for human consumption, as a way of introducing them (and us) to Karhide society.
	- (It's also worth noting that Sov is technically incorrect about English not having somer pronouns, as I think [neopronouns](https://intercultural.uncg.edu/wp-content/uploads/Neopronouns-Explained-UNCG-Intercultural-Engagement.pdf)such as xe and zie, as well as the singular "they," would probably qualify. In-universe, this can probably be explained by Sov not having met any humans who use these pronouns; out-of-universe, we have to remember that Le Guin published this story in 1995, when awareness of neopronouns and the singular "they" hadn't entered public discourse as much as it has today.)
- The world of Gethen--and, particularly, Gethenian biology and societies--is Ursula Le Guin's ==response to the feminist movement and the conversations it raised about sex and gender.== 
	- Le Guin attempts to explore sex and gender by positing a world that actively upends traditional notions of both; Gethenian culture does not link sex and gender nearly as intrinsically as we often do--gender is largely seen as a phase rather than an identity, and the majority of Gethenians have the same biological sex, as we understand the concept. 
	- This is also reflected in the language used--while there is still no singular "they" in the text, there is a very deliberate deployment of "he" and "she," used only for Gethenians when they've kemmered as a particular sex (or halfdeads locked into one sex or the other), and never otherwise.
- While on some level Karhide may seem like a gender utopia, it's also interesting to see the ways in which taboos and prejudice are treated here. 
	- It's mentioned briefly towards the end that the desire to avoid having children with biological relatives is a "modern scruple," something that sets Sov and Sether apart from their older relatives. 
	- The generation gap is also mentioned earlier, when Sov speaks of the stigma around the halfdeads, the rare Gethenians who are permanently in kemmer and born locked into one sex or the other, viewed by older Gethenians not only as deviants but as perverts.
- Karhide offers us a vision of a society that thinks about gender in such a different way than much of the world does, and in so doing it reminds us that ==different perspectives are not only possible but already exist, and existed long before this story came out.== 
	- (I'm sure trans people and nonbinary people will have very different experiences of this text than cis readers, for instance, as would Native American readers from communities that recognize two-spirit people.) 
	- Le Guin, to our knowledge, is a cisgender woman, and that perspective probably colors her handling of the text--the exploration is, by her own admission, kind of messy and more than a little flawed--but the work is still a great contribution to science fiction that explores ideas of identity, sex, and gender. And in a world where we are finally having these long-overdue conversations--perhaps even finally coming of age--I think that's a pretty great thing.
- **Sir Ron's Notes:**
	- In many ways, the Gethenian kemmer resembles the **estrous cycle**. Many mammals (including dogs and rodents) exhibit this type of reproductive behavior, where ==they are sexually receptive only at certain times of the year (largely hormonally determined).== 
	- This is unlike the **menstrual cycle** of humans and several other mammals, which are sexually receptive at any time. In fact, the physiological and behavior changes that kemmer triggers are very similar to estrus (colloquially know as being "in heat"), as seen in these paragraphs:

> "I was sick. My back ached all the time. My head ached and got dizzy and heavy… Tiny needles of agony shot through my nipples, hot as fire… My clitopenis was swollen hugely and stuck out from between my labia… My labia itched and reddened as with loathsome insect bites."
> 
> "To get jerked around like that by your own body, to lose control… Of being just a sex machine. And everybody just turns into something to have sex with. You know that people in kemmer go crazy and die if there isn’t anybody else in kemmer?"

- The latter paragraph describes the sexual urge that seizes estrous animals during periods of sexual receptiveness. ==It is a compulsion.==
	- Anyone who has had an intact (i.e. unspayed) male dog would know this. And as anyone who has had a female dog would know, failure of an intact one to mate within its lifetime can lead to a serious medical condition called **pyometra**, which is a disease in the uterus.
- The appearance of a clitopenis and a labia, as well as the alternation of roles during kemmer, clearly shows that Gethenians are **monoecious** organisms, or functional **hermaphrodites** that are functional both as males and females, if we define such based on their gonads and reproductive organs and their ability to produce both eggs and sperm. 
	- The term hermaphrodite has historically been used to describe humans that deviate from expected anatomical characteristics of males and females, or having anatomical characteristics of both sexes, but it has come to be a loaded term that has led to stigmatization. 
	- The preference in recent years has shifted to calling humans with these conditions (which come in many forms, several of them involving chromosomes) **intersex**. No intersex individual has been known to be able to produce both male and female gametes, so the term hermaphrodite as it is used on non-human animals is not appropriate even from a biological perspective. 
	- Based on how they are described in the story (and the brilliant novel _The Left Hand of Darkness_, which is set in the same world), Gethenians are true hermaphrodites. Specifically, they are **simultaneous hermaphrodites**, which are born with both gonads already functional, unlike s**equential hermaphrodites**, which change in sex later in their life, like clownfish. Regardless of its biological bases, "Coming of Age in Karhide" certainly invites us to rethink our norms in assigning sex roles, making it a very timely work of literature.

**Discussion Points**
1.  What did you think of Sov as a character? How did you respond to them as a protagonist?
2.  Which parts of Gethenian society did you find interesting? What parts of it do you wish we could have seen more of?
3.  In what ways do you think "Coming of Age in Karhide" succeeds as an exploration of ideas around identity, sex, and gender? In what ways do you think it fails?

#### The Unruly Body: Disease and Parasitism
> _**"If we cannot rely on our own bodies then on what can we rely?"**_
**-Andrew Tudor (1995)**

- Sickness and wasting away of the body due to disease and parasitism as body horror is very well captured by these words from Andrew Tudor in his paper "Unruly Bodies, Unquiet Minds" in the first volume of _Body and Society_. 
	- When we are sick, or to be more specific, when we have something inside our bodies that is threatening our normal bodily functions, it is ==as if we are losing control of our bodies==, and that is horrifying. This is why disease and parasitism are very common tropes in science fiction and horror and works that hybridize this genre. 
	- An outbreak of such a condition, where the pathogen or parasite strikes a greater number of people than expected, is the horrifying element at its most horrific. On top of ceding control of our bodies to invisible alien elements, the threat is now on the ==level that threatens the very fabric of society.== We can all understand what this means, all too sadly.

##### Disease and Parasitism: Basic Definitions and Common Threads
- Disease and parasitism are often discussed together because they work in very similar ways. In fact, scientists often use the same models to understand them.  
- **Disease** is a ==state of sickness or abnormal bodily condition== caused by a **pathogen**(the causative agent), usually but not always biological. 
	- Examples of common biological pathogens are bacteria, viruses, protozoans (unicellular eukaryotes), and fungi. The effects of disease are an interplay among three factors: the pathogen, the host, and the environment. This is why environmental sanitation and health are very important when dealing with a disease. 
	- The study of the distribution and determinants of disease in organisms and of the subsequent control of these health problems is called **epidemiology**.
- On the other hand, **parasitism** is an ==ecological relationship== wherein one (or several) organism invades the body of another and lives off it for nutrients. 
	- This is not the same as predation because parasites would typically live for an extended period of time on (if it's an **ectoparasite** like a tick) or in (if it's an **endoparasite** like a tapeworm) its host. Therefore, ==it would benefit the parasite to not kill its host outright.== 
	- Typical human parasites are other animals, particularly arthropods (ticks and fleas) and various worms (tapeworms, flukes, roundworms, etc.). They can be quite bizarre. Many of them have complex life stages where they can undergo both asexual and sexual reproduction, in a transient **intermediate host** and a more long-term **primary/definitive host**. For example, the flatworms called flukes, which usually infect the liver and the digestive system, can use freshwater snails as an intermediate host where they will reproduce asexually to produce many offspring, which will then penetrate the skin of an unsuspecting human bather who will serve as a primary host and an incubator of offspring produced through sexual reproduction. Many parasites can stay metabolically inert and dormant for a long time outside of the host in a tough state called a **cyst**. Parasites often look bizarre, too, because of such modifications as hooks  and suckers. 
- Disease and parasitism are usually modelled using the equation **R0 = NBL**, where:
	- _R0 = number of infected hosts over time;_
	- _N = number of susceptible hosts in the population;_
	- _B = transmission rate of disease/pathogen;_
	- _L = average period over which the host remains infectious_
- This essentially means that ==an increase in any of these values will also increase R0, the reproductive number, which is usually how the virulence of a disease is reported.== An R0 value of greater than 1 means that the disease will spread. 
	- If for example a disease's R0 is 15, then that means that one person can infect 15 people. A [July article in the _Emerging Infectious Diseases_ journal](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/7/20-0282_article) reported a median R0 value of 5.7 for COVID-19.
	- The current value differs from place to place. For example, the most recent reports from the UK state the value as ranging from 0.8 to 1. 
	- Science fiction diseases, particularly those figuring in outbreaks, usually play around with the reproductive number and its overall virulence.

##### Outbreaks: Sci-fi's World Killers
- When cases of disease go beyond what is expected for a given community, geographical area, or season, there is an **outbreak or epidemic**. When the disease starts penetrating geographical boundaries, particularly when it spreads to other countries, the epidemiological community usually calls it a **pandemic**. 
	- The world has seen many epidemics and pandemics such as smallpox, Spanish flu, Black Death, malaria, TB, cholera, yellow fever, typhus, and polio. The Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is one of the most important in current times. The Black Death, commonly referred to as the plague, killed 75-200 million people (30-60% of the European population) in the 14th century. It was caused by the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_ in fleas on black rats. Smallpox, caused by the _Variola_ virus, caused 400,000 deaths in Europe in the 18th century and 400-500 millions deaths by the 20th century, with a death rate of 20-60% (80% in children). Thankfully, smallpox was virtually eradicated in 1979. The Spanish Flu epidemic of 1918, caused by the H1N1 virus mutated from birds and pigs (thus making it a **zoonotic** disease, one that spreads from other animals to humans), infected 500 million people and killed 50-100 million in two years.  COVID-19 is nowhere near as virulent as any of these, though we also have modern medicine to thank for that.
- Predictably, sci-fi and horror authors love using pandemics. Stephen King's _The Stand_ is a prime example in the horror genre. The Captain Trips virus is likely the deadliest in fiction; it exterminates 99.4% of the human population. Michael Crichton's _Andromeda Strain_ is a completely alien pathogen, a virus-like entity that has no DNA, RNA, or amino acids. Interesting, many sci-fi works have used a disease to negatively affect human reproduction. In the comic book series _Y: The Last Man_ by Brian K. Vaughan and Pia Guerra, an unidentified disease kills virtually all mammals with a Y chromosome. Raccoona Sheldon's "The Screwfly Solution" is an alien invasion story by way of murder and reproductive failure; the aliens release a pathogen that drives men to kill women (quick biological note: it likely affects the frontal lobe, which mediates social behaviors). And of course, we have Alfonso Cuaron's _Children of Men_, one of the finest films ever made in any genre, an unknown condition has made females infertile or incapable of producing offspring.

##### Mind-Controlling Parasites
- In the amazing short story "The Only Neat Thing to Do" by James Tiptree, Jr. (who happens to be the same person as Raccoona Sheldon; her real name is Alice Sheldon), the intrepid young space adventurer Coati Cass encounters and becomes the unwitting host to an intelligent but equally naive microbe, Syllobene, who nestles in her brain and uses her own vocal cords and mouth to talk. It's a sweet coming of age and friendship tale that is nevertheless shadowed by the logical biological diagnosis that Syl satisfies all the criteria for an endoparasite. By her own admission, her species forms spores that are inert (i.e. cysts) outside of a host. She's feeding off the nutrients in Coati's blood and brain (even if she'd rather not be, the sweet thing!). And she has control over some of Coati's motor and behavioral functions. Yikes.
- It's not really mind control, but many Earth parasites _do_ have the ability to affect and drive their hosts' behaviors in a way that would be advantageous to the parasite. 
	- For example, the bacterium _Toxoplasma gondii_ hitches a ride in rats and makes them less afraid of the smell of cat urine, thereby increases the likelihood of the rat being eaten by a cat, which just happens to be _T. gondii_'s preferred host! 
	- The worm _Euhaplorchis__californiensis_ infects fish and makes them go up to the surface of the water and shimmy, so that the fish attracts a predatory shorebird. As you may have guessed, the shorebird is _E. californiensis_'s preferred host.
	- And of course, we have the _Cordyceps_ fungus made insanely popular by the video game series _The Last of Us_ (the _Cordyceps_ overlords thank thee!), which in their original, real-life ant hosts compel the ant to seek out the fungus's optimal growth conditions, usually high up in a tree, before bursting like a chestburster from the poor insect. 
	- Such amazing parasites do all of this by high-jacking, co-opting, and manipulating their hosts' nerve impulses and **neurotransmitters**, which are the ==hormones produced by our nervous system that regulate our behaviors.== Examples of neurotransmitters are dopamine, adrenaline, oxytocin, gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), and endorphins. You can imagine how rich a source of inspiration this could be for sci-fi/horror authors.

##### And Finally, Zombies
- I've argued in my paper _Mutations and Metamorphoses: Body Horror is Biology Horror_ that ==zombies are the ultimate in bodily abjection; there is complete loss of control of bodily functions, including and especially reproduction, and thus essentially an end in evolutionary tendencies.== 
	- Zombies in the true sense of being animated corpses are not alive, with non-functioning brains and hearts, and so they should not be able to move on their own. 
	- Supernatural causes such as dark rituals (pop culture depictions of voodoo), necromancy (*Dungeons and Dragons* and many other fantasy works), and demonic possession (_The Evil Dead_, _[REC]_) need not bother about the biological explanations. Sci-fi, however, does, and in this genre, the common culprits are radiation (the George Romero films, presumably), viruses (_28 Days Later_, _The Walking Dead_) or other biological agents (_The Last of Us_), and **prions**, which are mutated proteins like the ones that cause mad cow disease and Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD). This has proven to be quite attractive an explanation because of ==the association of prions with kuru, a disease caused by prions in the brain and spread by the cannibalistic practice of eating the brains of the dead in some indigenous New Guinea communities.== Also, prion diseases are ==neurodegenerative; they cause loss of balance, disrupted coordination, blindness, dementia, and sleep disorders.== Sound familiar?
- The beautifully romantic and bittersweet story "Love Will Tear Us Apart" by Alaya Dawn Johnson uses prions to explain the zombification of Philip Grayson. Interestingly, it also explains his lack of compunction to kill by saying that the prion has eaten away a good part of his ==frontal lobe, one of the many functions of which is to mediate human behavior according to social norms==; we behave in accordance with what society deems to be good behavior because of our frontal lobe. In Gene Wolfe's _Book of the Dying Sun_ (I don't know what else I need to tell you to convince you to read them!), certain humans in far-future Urth (Earth?) have elected to have their frontal lobes removed so as to remove all emotional and social obligations to fellow humans.
- That Johnson focuses so much on the brain is critical. Any attempt to scientifically explain a zombie would have to account for how it is moving on its own (unless some endoparasite like _Cordyceps_ is controlling the body), and ==only the brain functioning even at a very low level would explain that.== Typical zombie characteristics can be easily matched with damage or disorder in particular parts of the brain, such as slurred speech (speech centers in the cerebrum), rattling breath and moaning (medulla oblongata), and the slow, jerky, shambling motion (motor cortex and cerebellum).

**Points for Discussion**
1. Do you consider _Contagion_ to be science fiction? Why or why not?
2. In what ways can a pathogen or an element of it be a _novum_?
3. From both literary and biological perspectives, why do a lot of dystopian or apocalyptic sci-fi target human reproduction with their diseases or parasites?
4. What _novum_ in zombie literature do you find most interesting? Why?

#### "Love Will Tear Us Apart": Warmer Bodies
- Our next text for this module is "Love Will Tear Us Apart" by Alaya Dawn Johnson, a short story about a zombie who meets a boy whom he finds himself wanting to eat in, ah, more ways than one. We thought this was an appropriate text with which to begin to wrap up this module for a few reasons: because it invokes ideas of both sex and pathogens, identity and infection; because it's dark and cute and funny in a way that we think you all might really enjoy; because it would be irresponsible to let a course focused on biology and science fiction end without talking about zombies.
- The zombie is a classic monster with roots that go as far back as 1819 Brazil (with the word's roots seemingly being African), but its current form owes just as much to the tradition of undead-focused horror of the 20th century. The closest we've come so far in this class to providing a reasonably comprehensive definition of zombies is **"undead or sick humans characterized by physical resilience, impaired or absent mental faculties, and a hunger for the flesh of non-zombies."** While the early Haitian zombie was most often seen as a single undead being (a tradition echoed by works like H. P. Lovecraft's writing and even more recent texts like Stephen King's _Pet Sematery_), Oscar Romero's _Night of the Living Dead_ cemented two ideas in popular consciousness: the image of the zombie horde, and the associative link between zombies and capitalism.
- Where the vampire is most popularly portrayed as a creature of _desire_, the zombie is a creature of _hunger_, and this is a really interesting difference to explore. ==Vampires are characterized by control--domination and seduction--while zombies more exemplify the loss of it, the erosion of higher faculties by a force (usually a curse or a virus, or, as in this story, a prion) that replaces them with animalistic cravings and needs.== Our fear of the zombie is often described as ==a hyperbolized fear of the other==--a fear of the crowd, the belief that other people fundamentally cannot be reasoned with and are out to get you--but the _experience_ of the zombie is ultimately ==a defamiliarized version of being slave to wants and needs imposed on us by an external force.==
- Philip is a zombie in a world that has more or less gotten used to living with zombies. (How unrealistic, a world in which we learn to live with a terrifying disease instead of curing it.)Unlike "Bloodchild," whose status as a love story is tentative and a little ambiguous at best, Philip's story with Jack is very much a romance, passionate and fierce and kind of sexy and wholly consensual despite one of them being, essentially, undead. Desire in all its complexity is very much a driving force behind this narrative: the second paragraph of the story, where Philip reflects on his attraction to Jack, goes thusly-
> And what if he—I mean “it”—were really hot? Tall and lanky and weirdly well muscled, with bright blue eyes and ginger hair? So, he smells like the best meal you’ve ever eaten, but you kind of want to bone him too. Can’t have it both ways. You aren’t a necro. But a boy’s got to eat—maybe you could just nibble a bit at the edges? A part he won’t miss, and then fuck the rest of him. Eat an arm or something. He can still fuck with one arm. Not that well, though. Probably wouldn’t like it. Okay, a hand. Who ever needed a left hand? Then you remember that Jack—that’s his name, the mac and cheese—plays lacrosse. That’s probably where he got all those yummy muscles. You need two hands for lacrosse.
- Philip's attraction to Jack is multi-layered: physical, emotional, aesthetic, and carnal, in the hungry-zombie sense of the word as well as the sexual sense. For Philip, it seems, desire and literal hunger are tangled together in a way that we as readers may find unusual (especially if we're students in a science fiction class who have just been told that ==zombies usually signify hunger _as opposed to_ desire, lower-order wanting as opposed to higher-order yearning==). Here we see that Johnson's story is almost a response to traditional zombie fiction, a subversive shift in what the zombie _novum_ signifies: here, ==being a zombie is almost a metaphor for queerness==, a state of being and desiring that is seen as deviant, unnatural, and other, tolerated but not embraced, kept at the margins for fear that it might "infect" "the rest of us."
- The thing is, this is a scenario that shows both ==the power and the limitations of _nova_ as metaphors==: whether or not we read Philip's zombie state as a metaphor for queerness, he is also _literally a zombie_. And, much like with mutants and the mutant metaphor, we can't assume 1-to-1 correspondence between the signifier and the signified at all times, because otherwise you get into rather unfortunate implications, given that untreated zombies are dangerous, brain-rotted man-eaters. While Philip's zombification is very much tied up with queerness in this text in terms of how both play upon his body and the manner in which he desires, we can't then use this to say that being a zombie is exactly like being gay, or, worse, that being gay is just like being a zombie. Even in the world of the text, being a zombie means being a victim of a disease which eats away at parts of your brain, seems to impair your ability to regulate your actions, and, oh yeah, makes you want to eat people, whereas contrary to what your overly conservative relatives might say, being gay is not comparable to that _at all_. ==In this case especially, signifier and signified merely align; they are not one and the same.==
- And speaking of overly conservative relatives--let's talk for a bit about Jack's father, the Ice Man. On the face of it, the Ice Man isn't literally a homophobic dad standing in the way of his son's relationship because it's gay. He is, in fact, a zombie killer, one who's training his son to follow in his footsteps; in any other work, we might be rooting for this guy. But given what we know of Philip and his relationship with Jack, as well as our knowledge of the setting as a world in which some zombies have in fact successfully reintegrated into society, the Ice Man functionally plays the disapproving father role in the text to a T: committed to a worldview that brands certain types of people as monstrous and other, and refusing to broaden or change it even when presented with evidence to the contrary. The difference here is that just as queerness is entangled with zombification in the text, so too is the homophobic father trope mingled with the monster slayer image, which makes the stakes for this relationship dangerous on a much more literal level. The way in which Philip and the narrative confront and resolve this danger--the forces arrayed against the relationship as crystallized into the character of the Ice Man, to say nothing of the decisions faced by Jack--perfectly encapsulate what the relationship must go through, and (without spoiling anything) truly make the ending of the text earned, in every way that matters.

**Discussion Points**
1.  In the text, Philip's internal narration frequently compares Jack to mac and cheese. How do you read the fact that he's comparing the guy he likes to food? (Bonus: Why do you think mac and cheese specifically is the food in question?)
2.  Both love stories and horror stories are ultimately about encounters with the other. Compare and contrast how the other behaves in a love story vis-a-vis how it behaves in a horror story.
3.  Considering how the story ends, the final image on which the text ends is a strangely dissonant one. Why do you think that's the image we're left with?
4.  Discuss the title of "Love Will Tear Us Apart."
