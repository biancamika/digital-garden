#religion #spirituality 
- **The Reality of Slavery**
	- The phenomenal growth of the children of Israel leads to the people's enslavement: "...they set taskmasters over them to oppress with forced labor... The Egyptians became ruthless in imposing tasks on the Isarelites, and made their lives bitter with hard service" (Ex. 1:11, 13-14)
	- Insight #1: **You might not like slavery, but after a while, you get used to it.**
		- E.G. Spanish colonization, Martial Law
- **The Story of Exodus and the Reality of Unfreedom**
	- "...[W]e have constructed patterns in our lives--patterns in relationships, patterns at work, and so often, self-defeating patterns, which undermine our best interests...There is always a 'logical' connection between a surface symptom or pattern and a historic wounding to the soul." - *James Hollis, Finding Meaning in the Second Half of Life, 2005*
	- **[[Ignatian Spirituality]] and the Reality of Unfreedom**
		- We can see these self-defeating patterns...this form of slavery...as a invitation to greater awareness
		- "With much 'unfreedom' in us we will never be able to do serious discernment and we will just continue to be at the mercy of our attachments." *- Ramon Maria Luza Bautista, S.J., Schooled by the Spirit, 2009*
	- "Where is your brother?" (Gen 4:9). Where is your brother or sister who is enslaved? Where is the brother and sister whom you are killing each day in clandestine warehouses, in rings of prostitution, in children used for begging, in exploiting undocumented labour? Let us not look the other way...The issue involves everyone!" *- Pope Francis, Evangelii Gaudium #211* 
		- Pope Francis wishes for all of us to hear God's cry.
		- He tells us not to look the other way, because these issues involve everyone.
		- Reflect on the question of slavery that is amidst us: Who are our brothers and sisters? The ones whose lives have been made bitter by oppression?
		- The invitation for greater awareness is not again meant to bring us to a dark place, but really an invitation for deeper compassion and for deeper solidarity
	- **The Cry**
		- "The Isarelites groaned under their slavery, and cried out.... [T]heir cry for help rose up to God. God heard their groaning... remembered his covenant...and took notice of them" (Ex. 2:23-25)
		- The crying out is important because without the crying out, you just end up returning to Egypt. You just end up returning to slavery. The crying out, it's not just an expression of misery you knowthe crying out is also a complaint it'salso a protestit's also an acknowledgement that thingsare not rightthe crying out is the first sign ofopenness to the hopeful expectationthat slavery is not the last wordi
		- E.G. Student praying to God in a retreat about her anger and resentment towards her parents. By acknowledging these (and thus lifting these up to God), she felt that she had the opportunity to start anew.
		- That's what tears are all about. They are an acknowledgement that one needs to be saved.
		- Insight #2: **The basic requirement of freedom is the awareness of "exile", the groan of conscious alienation.** *- Avivag Gottlieb Zornberg* [[Freedom requires awareness of exile]]
			- Before one can be free, one must be aware that one is not free. That awareness is manifested in the crying out.
			- [[Freedom is being conscious of your constraints]]
			- [[The alternative to freedom is unconsciousness]]
		- **Ignatian Spirituality and Self-Awareness**
			- Saint [[Ignatius of Loyola]] says that one of the temptations of the evil spirit is to tell us to keep your weakness in the dark. Just keep it hidden, don't let it be known. But we know the change begins when we are able to bring our weakness into the light.
			- "As [[Ignatius of Loyola]] observes, the enemy of human nature does fear discovery. While our weaknesses remain unacknowledged or closeted away, we are powerless over them. The sometimes painful process of dragging our weaknesses into full light of day by understanding them is the first empowering stride toward conquering them." *- Chris Lowney, Heroic Leadership, 2003*
			- Related to insights from #DLQ10 
				- [[The wound is the place where the Light enters you]]
				- [[Brokenness]]
		- "When the heart is able to ask itself and weep, then we can understand something... Dear young boys and girls, today's world doesn't know how to cry...[[Certain realities of life we only see through eyes cleansed by our tears]]. I invite each one here to ask yourself: ==have I learned how to weep?== Have I learned how to weep for the marginated or for a street child who has a drug problem or for an abused child?" *- Pope Francis, Message to Filipino Youth at UST, 18 Janurary 2015*
		- The cry is pivotal in opening the gates that make freedom and liberation possible.
- **The Call of Moses**
	- "The cry of the Isarelites has now come to me; I have also seen how the Egyptians oppress them. So come, I will send you to Pharaoh to bring my people, the Isarelites, out of Egypt." (Ex. 3:9-10)
	- Certain formula in the Bible: people are called by God, and they object to this.
	- Moses objects to God 5 times. Roberto finds Moses' call fascinating because it's as if the Lord throughout that entire process was shaping his heart, shaping his heart to make it more docile to the promptings of the Lord's spirit.
	- Insight #3: **[[God calls each of us to the vocation of freedom]].**
- **The Summons to Vocation**
	- "God calls you to make definitive choices, and He has a plan each of you: to discover that plan and to respond to your vocation is to move toward personal fulfillment." *- Pope Francis, World Youth Day 2013*
	- When we ask questions such as "What is the meaning of my life?", "Why was I created?", "Why am I here?", "This one life I have...what am I being invited to gamble it on?"...we enter the realm of vocation. ==Where are we being someone to?==
	- "The Christian vocation, rooted in the contemplation of the Father's heart, ... inspires us to solidarity in bringing liberation to our brothers and sisters, especially the poorest." *- Pope Francis, World Day of Prayer for Vocations, 26 April 2015*
		- Vocation is not just personal.
		- This reminds us that the question is not just at this point in my life "Am I more free?" An equally important question is: "Are others, especially the poorest among us, more free because of me?"
	- "God calls you to the place where your deep gladness and the world's deep hunger meet." *- Frederick Bucchner*
		- Reminds us that vocation is not just my deepest gladness and my deepest joys (See [[Ignatian Spirituality]] and [[Desire]]), but rather ==the intersection of my deepest desires and the world's deepest hungers.==
	- "The meaning of your life is to find your gift. The purpose of your life is to give it away." *- Pablo Picasso*
- **For Reflection and Prayer**
	- How would you describe your inner journey these past years. Take time to recall the most significant lights and shadows of your journey.
	- Reflecting upon your life and deepest desires, what do you think you are being called to doz.
	- What would you consider the 'Egypt' that enslaves you? How do these affect you, your relationships, work, and life?

- **Crossing the Sea: From Slavery to Freedom, Death to Life**
	- "What have you done to us, bringing us out of Egypt! Is rhis not the very thing we told you in Egypt, 'Let us alone and let us serve the Egyptians?' For it would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the wilderness." *- Exodus 14:1-14*
		- Why did the Isarelies miss Egypt? Perhaps because of fear.
	- Insight #4: **[[What makes change difficult is fear]]. If you want to live in mediocrity, then live in fear.** *- Fr. Venacio Calpotura SJ*
		- [[Mediocrity stems from fear]]
	- "Fear governs so much of our lives...Standing up to our fear is perhaps the most critical decision necessary in the governsnce of our life..." *- James Hollis, Finding Meaning in the Second Half of Life, 2005*
	- James Hollis states that one of the most common ways fear can be in charge will be found in ==our flight from personal responsibility.== 
		- What does one do when one is afraid? Blaming and scapegoating.
		- This is exactly what the Isarelites did with Moses.
		- When one is afraid, one lets go of responsibility.
		- But we can choose to stand up to our fears instead.
	- "There is a temptation that says it is 'better to stay here,' where I'm safe. But this is the slavery of Egypt: 'I fear moving forward, I'm afraid of where the Lord will bring me.' Fear, however, 'is not a good counselor.'" *- Pope Francis, Courage in Spite of Our Weakness, 2 July 2013*
	- Hollis also says that the other by-product of fear is lethargy: the lack of energy, the lack of enthusiasm, the lack of the will to move forward, to dream, to imagine.
		- We are tempted to give in, to be immobilized by fear.
	- Moses' response: "Fear not, stand firm, and *see* the salvation of the Lord, which he will work for you today; for the Egyptians whom you *see* today, you shall never *see* again. The Lord will fight for you, and you have only to be still."
		- Moses uses the word see 3 times. This was probably deliberate because you have to remember that what caused Israel's fear was what they looked at. What caused their fear was what they saw. Moses is telling them to not look at the sources of your fearr. Change what you're looking at. Rather than look at your fear, look at what the Lord will do for you today.
	- Insight #5: **To lead involves helping one's self and others 'see' things in a new light.** [[Leadership involves helping yourself and others see things in a new light]]
		- Moses was a leader to the Isarelites because he taught them to see themselves and reality in a new way.
	- "May your choices reflect your hopes, not your fears." *- Nelson Mandela*
		- Same act of looking, but you decide what you look at
	- Prevalent method of leadership: making people fixate on their fears. Is this necessary? Alternative method: ordinary citizens and leaders inspiring through hope
	- When you reach a point in your life where all around you you're afraid, then you would have reached a point where you must now make a decision.
		- Israel had to make a decision: go back to the familiar (Egypt), or venture into the unknown (sea)?
		- They could drown, they could die...but there is also the potential to gain freedom, a new life. But they won't be able to know this without risk
		- At every point in our life we have two options.  One option is to go back to the familiar, even if the familiar is slavery. The other option is to move forward and risk death to see whether there's life and freedom at the other end.
		- Insight #6: **[[Change happens only when we are willing to leave the familiar-that-enslaves behind]].**
	- **Two Walls:**
		- jean luiska a jesuitbiblical scholar he says you know inancient timeswhenever someone wants to orientatehimselfor herself whenever someone wants to ina sense get a sense of bearinga sense of direction that person wouldlook to the eastwould look to the east and when you lookto the eastyou have the south to your right and youhave thenorth to your left
		- "And the people of Israel went into the midst of the sea on dry ground, the waters being a wall to them on their right hand and left."
		- "right" = yamin, which also means "south"
		- "left" = semol, which also means "north"
		- If the Isarelites had the south to their right and the north to their left, they were traversing from west to east.
		- In Ancient Near East... 
			- The "east" was the gate of life, the place where the light (the sun) defeats darkness and death. 
			- The "west" was the entrance into the underworld, the world of darkness, death, and evil
		- Therefore, if the Isarelites were traveling from West to East, they were traversing and fighting the forces of death, the forces of darkness and evil, the forces of their desires, to be born unto a new life at dawn.
			- This is what Exodus is all about: ==a journey from slavery to freedom.==
			- This is not just Israel's story; it's also the story of each and every one of us.
	- "Growing up...requires two practices. First, we must ==take responsibility for ourselves==, and stop blaming others: the society, the parents, the partner, the malevolent gods. Secondly, we have to ==look within== to see the repetitive core ideas, the complexes, and the historic influenced w==here the true enemy== lies." *- James Hollis, Finding Meaning in the Second Half of Life, 2005*
	- "Human history, our history, the history of every one of us is never 'finished'; it never runs out of possibilities. Rather, it is always opening to the new -- to what, until now, we had never had in mind. To what seemed impossible." *- Pope Francis (as quoted by Cathleen Falsani), 23 May 2013* #history 
	- "And suddenly you just know...it's time to start something new and trust the magic of beginnings." *- Mister Eckhart*
- **For Reflection and Prayer**
	- What "sea" is the Lord inviting you to cross? In what concrete area of your life are you being asked to move from slavery to freedom, from lethargy to generosity?
	- To what newness is the Lord inviting you?
	- On COVID-19: "Historically, pandemics have forced humans to break with the past and imagine their world anew. This one is no different. It is a portal, a gateway between one world and the next. We can choose to walk through it, dragging the carcasses of our prejudice and hatred, our avarice, our data banks and dead ideas, our desd rivers and smoky skies behind us. Or we can walk through lightly, with little luggage, ready to imagine another world. And ready to fight for it." *- Arundhati Roy* #history 
	- ==Journey gently, journey lightly, journey bravely.==

#### [Slavery and Freedom Lecture](https://youtu.be/0GLKiafNMGE)
- Overview: self -> networks -> relationships -> organizations -> spirituality
- **There are many things that make us unfree.**
	- Even those we are unconscious of. [[The alternative to freedom is unconsciousness]]
	- So we have to really reflect on what enslaves us...
	- Slavery is dehumanizing
		- This applies not only to the captured, but also to the captors
		- We cannot say that we are promoting humanity if we ourselves are doing the enslavement
	- Slavery can come not just from the outside, but also from within
		- We can enslave ourselves with particular habits and practices
	- The first step is really about recognition. Awareness is what leads to action
- **Inner freedom comes from fulfilling your vocation**
	- This calling is specific to your unique situation in a particular manner
	- God doesn't just want you to be one thing...he wants you to be many things...hence multiple callings
	- Knowing your calling is important. But how will you know this?
		- First, you have to try it
		- At the end of the day, if it leaves you feeling fulfilled, then that's a good sign
		- We can never know our vocation until we're in it, until we're doing it
	- We only get confirmation for the vocation that we have rather than a clear sense of it prior to even doing it
	- We get our vocation not from reflecting alone, but trying it out
	- Try out different locations; try out different lives
		- The time we spend on trying something that doesn't turn out to be a fit will never be wasted
- **[[Ubuntu]]**: my freedom is tied to someone else's freedom. I cannot be free unless they are free.
	- Tied to [[Decolonialism]]
	- We cannot be free if we are simply doing things for ourselves.
	- Explaining freedom: the ability to manifest desire.
		- If I want to do something, can I do it? If I want to have something, can I acquire it?
		- If we're able to help others, do we help them? There's a certain freedom in that.
		- Our freedom is intimately tied with the freedom of others (e.g. friends, family, acquaintances, strangers in proximal places)
	- Think: how is slavery and freedom a **communal** concept for us?
		- How can we be enslaved by certain things, by certain material realities, by certain social systems?
		- How can we experience freedom from being with the people we are currently with now?
		- If you're given the chance in the future, will you be able to use your power to help people experience freedom?
