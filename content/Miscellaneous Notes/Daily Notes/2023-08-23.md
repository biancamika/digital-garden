## Practice Teaching
#education #EDUC130_3 
**Teacher (and learner) roles from traditional approaches**
- If the teacher is an ==expert==…
	- The learner is a ==sponge==
- If the teacher is a ==performer==…
	- The learner is an ==audience==
- If the teacher is an ==inspector==…
	- The learner is a ==product==
**Teacher (and learner) roles from *Learning by Refraction*
- If the teacher is a ==designer== of learning environment and experience (instead of an expert)…
	- Every class will be designed so that learning would happen
	- What students know of the topic will also come out
	- The learner becomes an ==inquirer==
- If the teacher is a ==facilitator== of reflection and meaning-making (instead of a performer)…
	- The classroom is a stage; everyone has a role to play so that they can shine
	- The learner becomes a ==meaning-maker==
- If the teacher is a ==coach== of transfer learning (instead of an inspector)…
	- Learning is more than pass or fail
	- The learner becomes a ==creator==
**What does *Cura Personalis* mean here?
- Curriculum centered on the person rather than the material to be covered
- Of equal importance is the self-discipline expected of each student, shown in the intellectual rigor and serious study
- Responsible use of freedom. Students accept gifts and develop them as they accept limitations and overcome these.
