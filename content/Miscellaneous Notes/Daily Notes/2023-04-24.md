	- ^ so much desire for this, that nothing is ever enough....I never get fulfilled
	- Friend: Even if you get what you want, you'll never stop comparing yourself. You're in  a constant state of comparison

- Quotes
	- One of my favorite Bible verses is Psalms 30: 11. 
		- **You turned my wailing into dancing; you removed my sackcloth and clothed me with joy**
		- https://radical.net/podcasts/pray-the-word/from-mourning-into-dancing-psalm-3011-12/
	- Rubem Alves: "Hope is the ability to hear the melody of the future. Faith is the courage to dance to it today."
		- For module 4?
	- Albert Einstein
		- Dancers are the athletes of God
		- "...we are the dancers, we create the dreams"
	- [Rumi's Dance](https://artofsaudade.com/2021/12/14/rumis-dance/)
		- _Whosoever knoweth the power of the dance, dwelleth in God. Without love, all worship is a burden, all dancing is a chore, all music is mere noise._
		- Dance and poetry have one thing in common – ==freedom==, as mortals call it. 13th-century Persian poet Rumi would describe dance as connecting to our true essence. ==When we dance, we free ourselves.==
			- “Dance, when you’re broken open. Dance, if you’ve torn the bandage off. Dance in the middle of the fighting. Dance in your blood. Dance when you’re perfectly free.” 
		- Freedom, just like poetry, requires ==sacrifice.== It is only through sacrifice that we attain freedom.
			- [[Permanent Notes/The wound is the place where the Light enters you]]
			- [[Resource Notes/Inner Compass]] example
			- _Dancing is not just getting up painlessly, like a leaf blown on the wind; dancing is when you tear your heart out and rise out of your body to hang suspended between worlds._
		- According to Rumi, dance is the ==very essence of life== that can be seen everywhere in nature : the sunlight dancing with the shadows, the wind dancing with the trees or the bees with the flowers. Rumi’s world is a world of wonders and in order to see it, we must dance!
			- _Now is the time to unite the soul and the world. Now is the time to see the sunlight dancing as one with the shadows._
			- [[Permanent Notes/The Divided Life]]

#### Research Dump
- Narcissism
	- isn't caused by an inflated sense of ego; it's caused by ==insecurity==: https://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2021/march/narcissism-driven-by-insecurity--not-grandiose-sense-of-self--ne.html
	- Narcissistic injuries/wounds 
		- https://psychcentral.com/lib/narcissistic-injuries-what-they-are-and-how-to-protect-yourself-from-them#overview
			- Narcissistic injuries are situations that trigger feelings of incompetence or unworthiness.
				- what narcissists might feel when they encounter ==criticism, loss, or perceived abandonment.== Even though they may not show it, they may experience humiliation and rejection. It’s their feelings in these situations that may be considered narcissistic injuries. Rather than express vulnerability and reveal how they feel, they may react with defiance, arguments, and even a [narcissistic rage attack](https://psychcentral.com/disorders/narcissistic-personality-disorder/narcissistic-collapse/).
					- Mom definitely has rage attacks
			- Example responses: gaslighting, silent treatment, arguments
			- Root causes: abuse or neglect during childhood, unrealistic parental expectations, excessive pampering and praise from parents, narcissistic parent or parents
		- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic_injury
			- Another definition: ==emotional trauma== that overwhelms an individual's defense mechanisms and devastates their pride and self-worth. In some cases the ==shame== or disgrace is so significant that the individual can never again truly feel good about who they are and this is sometimes referred to as a "narcissistic scar"
				- [[Permanent Notes/Self-rejection]]
			- Narcissists are often [pseudo-perfectionists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfectionism_(psychology) "Perfectionism (psychology)") and create situations in which they are the center of attention. The narcissist's attempts at being seen as perfect are necessary for their grandiose [self-image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-image "Self-image"). If a perceived state of perfection is not reached, it can lead to [guilt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guilt_(emotion) "Guilt (emotion)"), [shame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shame "Shame"), [anger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anger "Anger") or [anxiety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety "Anxiety") because the subject believes that they will lose the admiration and love of other people if they are imperfect. ==Because some children are raised to believe that love is conditional, obsession with being perfect becomes routine for them.== As a result, when failing in any aspect of life, the child will feel as if they are no longer accepted, causing a narcissistic injury. Examples of reasons why children would show narcissistic injury due to perfectionism include failing exams, losing in competitions, being denied acceptance, disagreement in conversation with others, and constructive criticism. 
				- [[Permanent Notes/Perfectionism]]
				- [[Permanent Notes/The False Self]]
- Black Swan (Nina as Narcissus)
	- [Weeping for Narcissus](https://lechatdargent.wordpress.com/2011/02/14/weeping-for-narcissus-a-review-of-black-swan/)
		- The essence of narcissistic injury is this: a person naturally grows their own sense of who they are, and seeks love and approval from important others. ==The narcissistic injury occurs when the important others attack that home-grown sense of self, and demand that an external standard be achieved instead.== So, natural sense of self is rejected as sub-standard; external sense of what self should be is imposed.
			- [[Permanent Notes/The False Self]] v.s. [[Permanent Notes/The True Self]]
		- Consequently, the narcissistic injury drives a ==perfectionism== that is un-natural (because it doesn’t actually fit with what the person wants ‘in their heart of hearts’), and can never be satisfied (because the external standard is alien, so any success can’t truly be felt as belonging to self).
			- [[Permanent Notes/Perfectionism]]
		- In the Greek myth, the beautiful young man Narcissus is cursed by the Gods to fall in love with his own reflection; but he doesn’t know he is in love with his reflection, he takes his reflection to be another person. That is the tragedy of ==narcissistically driven ambition==; the person who is so driven doesn’t realise they are chasing their own reflection, which they are doomed never to attain, however successful they are.
		- Applied to Nina, her injury is clear; she needs to be the Swan Queen to feel worthwhile because, in her narcissistically driven emotional reality, there are only two categories: ==perfection and worthlessness.== Incidentally, this dichotomy of perfection and worthlessness plays itself out well between Nina and Beth; the former’s star rising as the latter’s descends.
			- A binary way of seeing the world... [[Permanent Notes/Absolute Certainty versus Wonder]]
		- The influence of Nina’s mother sits heavily in the background, and it is striking that the film doesn’t make an overly big deal out of this. It is simply presented as the way things are, meaning that the full impact and implications of Nina’s homelife aren’t over played.
			- Damn same
		- There are no characters, _even those whose approval Nina is seeking_ that have an effective existence independently of Nina. Consider that as an ==emotional reality; one in which people only exist in the context of your own goals.== That is part of the trap of narcissistic relating; Nina only ever relates to her own reflection, never the actual people she meets. That is true not only of the other girls in the company, but also director Thomas, and Nina’s mother; the two people whose approval Nina so desperately seeks.
			- Related to the [[Permanent Notes/Ressentiment]] I experience?
		- Consequently, it isn’t possible for Nina to receive human nourishment because at no point is she in contact with another person; she relates only to her own reflection. And reflection is a great way of explaining what happens when we project unwanted aspects of ourselves onto others; the other becomes a pool of water, upon the surface of which we see something of ourselves without recognising it as such. In a sense, ==all projection could be considered Narcissistic.==
			- [[Permanent Notes/Ressentiment]]...I am projecting onto the people I envy
		- I feel more able to weep for Narcissus; trapped as he is in a world of his own reflections, driven further and further into isolation by his need to attain perfection.
	- [Aronofsky’s Black Swan as a Postmodern Fairy Tale: Mirroring a Narcissistic Society](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0787/10/3/86)
		- Both Freudians and Jungians designate an individual’s perceiving a repressed aspect of the self in another as a projection: “if people observe their own unconscious tendencies in other people, this is called a projection ([von Franz 1991, p. 37](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0787/10/3/86#B41-humanities-10-00086)).” Jung described this shadow as an inferiority that individuals may wish to “escape,” by “looking for everything dark, inferior and culpable in others ([Jung 1970, p. 203](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0787/10/3/86#B17-humanities-10-00086))”. As William Miller (1991, p. 39) states, “Projection is an unconscious mechanism that is employed whenever a trait or characteristic of our personality that has no relation to consciousness becomes activated. As a result of the unconscious projection, we observe and react to this unrecognized personal trait in other people. We see in them something that is part of ourselves, but which we fail to see in ourselves.” Furthermore, “…anytime our response to another person involves excessive emotion or overreaction, we can be sure that something unconscious has been prodded and is being activated (Miller 1991, p. 40)
			- [[Authenticity]] and [[Permanent Notes/Brokenness]]: shadow self
			- [[Permanent Notes/Ressentiment]]
		- Psychoanalyst [West-Leuer](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0787/10/3/86#B42-humanities-10-00086) ([2017, p. 1240](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0787/10/3/86#B42-humanities-10-00086)) claims that Nina has a narcissistic personality with a “perfectionist ideal-ego” that “expects achievement, self-control, and functionality
		- The chief sign of the pursuit of perfection is obsession. (e.g. practicing, body dysmorphia)
			- [[Permanent Notes/Perfectionism]]
				- [[Perfectionism disables us from seeing life as it truly is]] (her hallucinations)
				- [[Perfectionism renders growth unnecessary and obsolete]] (inability to mature)
				- [[Perfectionism makes us harm ourselves and others more]]
			- [[Permanent Notes/Disordered attachments]]
		- Furthermore, [Woodman](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0787/10/3/86#B43-humanities-10-00086) ([1982, p. 13](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0787/10/3/86#B43-humanities-10-00086)) states that this perfectionist attitude originates in a ==work-driven society in which individuals put on the mask (persona) of determined efficiency== and follow society’s “rhythms”, but that their animal nature is denied:
			- [[Permanent Notes/The Divided Life]]
		- The power play between Nina’s striving for perfection and her animal (sexual) nature soon becomes dangerous. As [Woodman](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0787/10/3/86#B43-humanities-10-00086) ([1982, p. 42](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0787/10/3/86#B43-humanities-10-00086)) states: “Psychologically speaking, so long as conscious and unconscious are enemies, the ego experiences itself as in constant danger of death.” (i.e. black swan v.s. white swan)
			- [[Permanent Notes/Brokenness]]
			- [[Authenticity]]: tackling the shadow self
		- Vicky, Nina, and Beth’s obsessive quest for artistic perfection portrays the psychological and corporeal self-destructiveness of their obsession. Of course, the ubiquitous mirrors that Nina stares into refer to her internal conflict, but also serve as a crucial tool of her profession. As Alastair [Macauley](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0787/10/3/86#B20-humanities-10-00086) ([2011, p. 1](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0787/10/3/86#B20-humanities-10-00086)) notes, ==dancers perceive in mirrors “both the ideal versions of themselves they hope to show to the public as well as their own failings.”== Ballerinas’ fixation on their bodies and movements clearly functions as a prerequisite for the near-perfect illusion that they present on stage.
		- As [Hotchkiss](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0787/10/3/86#B16-humanities-10-00086) ([2003, p. 13](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0787/10/3/86#B16-humanities-10-00086)) states, “For Narcissists ==competition of all kinds is a way to reaffirm superiority”== and adds that narcissists (like Nina) ‘become ==compulsive== in their pursuit of perfection. Along the way, they crave admiration from others.”
			- this is why i'm so competitive.... [[False Humility]] and [[Permanent Notes/Ressentiment]]
			- Compulsive: [[Permanent Notes/Disordered attachments]]
		- However, the horror of Nina’s insanity and death undercuts her transcendent transfiguration and suggests a critique of a contemporary narcissistic society in which ==humans may sacrifice parts of their identity, their socially undesirable traits, in their pursuit of perfect images and performances.== This obsessive pursuit of perfection can result in a psychic, even actual death.
			- [[Permanent Notes/The False Self]]
		- Although Black Swan’s final scene suggests that Nina’s struggles have destroyed her, it does offer a moral: the obsessive quest for perfection can be fatal and humans can find happiness if they ==strive for wholeness== instead of perfection
			- "As I have argued above, it is Nina’s inability to integrate both her White Swan (her social persona) and her Black Swan (her shadow) into one harmonious whole that leads to her demise." [[Permanent Notes/The Divided Life]]
			- [[Authenticity]]
- [Shining on the Stage: Narcissism and the Performing Arts](https://sobider.com/?mod=tammetin&makaleadi=&makaleurl=371b840f-c7e5-4898-ac59-7ad258277bb8.pdf&key=40557)
	- Performers should distinguish between an ==inner self and a commercial self== in order to eliminate the harmful effects of narcissism and to have a more peaceful and healthy performing life
	- Stage performers generally tend to have narcissistic personal traits. The studies showed that narcissistic performers are visionary and inspirational (Campbell, et al, 2011). Many times the society adores, watches, follows and loves them because they are determined and selfassured leaders (Dionne and Davis, 2012: 135-140). Their courage on risk-taking (Brunell and Buelow, 2017: 3-14) is interesting and exciting to watch because normal and standard actions are safe but boring. Thus it can be concluded that the society forces performers to be narcissistic to some extent, since performers should be applauded, liked, admired and gone after. ==If performers do not adore their own selves, nobody does==
	- The theory that low narcissistic individuals do not try hard to prove themselves to anybody and do not use self-enhancement opportunities (Wallace and Baumeister, 2002) strengthens the idea that narcissism brings success. It can be concluded that if narcissistic performers face negative feedback, sarcasm or criticism, they can get angry, frustrated and disappointed. Since the reaction was seen as an ego-threat, they can see this as an opportunity to prove their future success and work harder. Moreover, the study of Martinsen points out that narcissists have creative personalities and strong motivation (Martinsen et al, 2019: 166-171). This fact enables narcissistic stage performers to be more successful since stage is a creative working area. The coworkers and the audience of narcissists would be excited, and appreciate creativity and motivation which contribute a lot to the performance.
