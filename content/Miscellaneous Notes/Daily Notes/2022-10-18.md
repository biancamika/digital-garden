## Story Jam Interfaces

**5 Core Screens:**
1. Character creation 
2. Character interaction 
3. Homebase
	4. Character library (where you can see all the other characters you've designed)
	5. Accomplishments 
	6. Friends (which of them are online?) 
4. Interacting with friends 
	1. Friends occupy the same room live with AI characters, rolepalying
5. Remixing roleplays
	1. We don't just want to represent the experience of roleplaying, but also how this would look like in content form

**Scope:**
- Just need 1 screen for each
- how to represent the end-to-end experience
- doesn't have to be fully-baked designs...just give 2-3 concepts...can be very simple sketches/wireframes

**Notes:**
- ideal: infinitely fun, creative experience
- send constant updates
- when thinking about concepts, do 1 for mobile, and do 1 for laptop (they want to compare the devices)


**Examples:**
- they're chatting with an AI, and the AI is creating life to that character
	- "i want the cat to be black...wait no, orange" QUALITIES: sound, personality, clothing
- going on an adventure with this character.. like you're in a haunted house "What's going on here?" you can interact with the character while immersed in the space
- Your content creator made some media; how can you remix their roleplay? like Tiktok duets
