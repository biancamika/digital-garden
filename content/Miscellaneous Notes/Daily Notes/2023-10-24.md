#### Answer
##### Draft
- Insight: sports and imagined communities
	- community is created by personal choices, as well as social factors like location, ethnicity, etc. They coexist or take the place of family, ethnic or local communities in providing a sense of identity and belonging.
- Belonging and identity in sports: communities are shaped by and shape other strands of identity, e.g. family, ethnicity, nationality etc. Hence identities often described as hybrid.
	- hybrid identities of Filipinos
	- Filipinos as mixing pot
- Belonging and identity necessarily implies forms of exclusion. Excluding "others" is correlative to this sense of belonging. Certain profiles (age, gender, ethnicity etc.) often characterize those who belong or are excluded. Thus there is always the danger of "neo-tribalism" in sports.
	- E.G. the inherent masculinity of certain styles like krump and breaking?
- Taking the ‘Street’ Mainstream: The Power of Krump Dancing to Transform Youth Violence
	- This article explores how ‘street’ and ‘decent’ practices of inner-city youth intertwine to alter the social structure of their communities. 
	- Using the case of ‘krump’ dancing, I examine how this practice transforms aggression and violence to improve the life chances for at-risk youth
-  “Make Some Noise for the Ladies…”  Sexism in European Hip-Hop Dance Battles
	- The marginalisation of women in battle culture is also evident in the language some hosts use when referring to female competitors.
	- Other facets of sexism in hip-hop battle culture are far more overt, from unwarranted physical contact, to inappropriate comments during practice, to clear institutional gender discrimination.
- Jojo Diggs and Jade "Soul" Zuberi Share 3 Important Topics on Street Dance Culture
	- most dancer commit microagressions everyday without realizing it
	- Cultural appropriation: anything that takes something from another culture out of context and uses it for their own gain
		- E.G. appropriating Black culture with doorags, Dashikis, cornrows, hand gestures like gang signs
		- E.G. making up style descriptions for hiphop, using non-hiphop music...remember that styles are CULTURES
	- Street dance is a culture, not a costume
	- "Culture vulture": when someone is profiting off of another culture without cultural respect and integrity
- Dance and clothes?
- appropriation of styles

One insight that I found enlightening was about communities in sports: belonging and identity necessarily implies forms of exclusion, and this kind of exclusion is correlative to this sense of belonging. This insight struck me because it reminded me of the integral role culture plays in street dance, one of the main sports that I'm personally involved in. Styles in street dance are not just styles, but cultures; however, this tends to be forgotten in competitive settings, leaving these dance styles to be watered down into movements without context. In this report, I'll discuss the history behind street dance, and why it is the responsibility of dancers, as artist-athletes, to honor this.

Most street dance styles were pioneered by dancers from minority groups, which may be defined by social factors such as race, gender, and socioeconomic class. For instance, hip-hop emerged in Black communities living in the Bronx, where people turned to dance for emotional release  – a positive alternative to the drugs and violence that took over the neighborhood due to segregation's longstanding effects. This can also be seen in krump, which was created in downtown Los Angeles by young people as an alternative to violent street gang participation. Another example is waacking, which started in the gay clubs of Los Angeles; poor Black, Latino, and Asian men found the freedom to express themselves in these clubs, in spite of the oppressive environments they dealt with in their everyday lives. What we can take away from all these origin stories is that those who were excluded created a space where they could belong – and this was done through dance. 

Now, street dance is more popular than ever. These styles have grown from being rooted in their respective communities to becoming global phenomena. Learning street dance is more accessible too; instead of going to streets or clubs, people can learn these styles through dance studios and online videos. However, the downside of this popularity is cultural appropriation: these styles are often used by others without acknowledging the people behind them. A prime example of this is the isolation of movements from their respective cultures. I first learned street dance styles like waacking in my high school's dance crew. My teammates and I would learn certain movements, which would then be put into choreographies for dance competitions. When I look back, I can definitely remember being taught these styles – but not so much the history behind them. Cultural appropriation can also be seen in clothing. Past elements of my dance crew's costumes include cornrows and Dashikis – which are distinctly from Black culture. Back then, I didn't know how harmful it was to be trying to look this way, even if I wasn't Black myself (which goes to show how normalized it was at the time). In general, what I've noticed is that in competitive settings, the history and meaning of street dance is stripped away in favor of flashiness and aesthetics.

Cultural appropriation is harmful because it disrespects the people behind these cultures – and these people often tend to be marginalized. These styles were created by dancers dealing with systems of oppression, and these uncomfortable origins cannot remain unacknowledged. Renowned Hip Hop instructor and activist Soul Zuberi explains the profound impact of appropriation: "...People have died over the things that you’re taking. People have lost their jobs, been treated like social pariahs, and spent hours laboring over learning these moves in secret. How can you then do those same moves without demonstrating respect to that struggle? You can’t trivialize the experience". Some may argue that working to minimize cultural appropriation creates gated cultures that only certain groups can participate in (e.g. "Only queer people can waack"), but this is not the case. Minimizing cultural appropriation breaks down barriers between dominant cultures and minority cultures, ensuring that everyone receives respect and appreciation for their authentic work.

Thus, I believe that dancers, as artist-athletes, need to get educated in street dance culture if they are to compete. In a competition, every dancer involved has the responsibility of representing their style/s authentically. The best way to get educated would be through immersion. Streets and clubs are the classrooms with the most context, so dancers would best be able to learn about culture in these settings. 


- history...many dance styles came from minority groups
	- Hiphop has deep historical and social roots in African American culture, having emerged in Black communities living in 1970s New York.
		- Hip Hop first exploded in the Bronx where young Black dancers used their movement as a form of emotional release – a positive alternative to the drugs and violence that gripped their neighborhood due to the longstanding effects of segregation.
	- Whacking found its start in the 1970s gay clubs of Los Angeles where high-energy funk and disco music dominated the airwaves. It was in these clubs that poor Black, Latino, and Asian men found the freedom to express themselves through movement, despite the oppressive environments they faced in day-to-day life.
	- Krump dancing is an urban street dance that started in 2000. It was created by a group of young people in South Central, Los Angeles, California as an alternative to violent street gang participation. Embedded in a community rife with gang culture, these at-risk young people modelled the organisational structure of krump after the street gang.
- cultural appropriation
	- Working to minimize cultural appropriation is not about creating gated cultures that only certain people can participate in – it’s the opposite. You’re breaking down the barriers between dominant cultures and minority cultures, so that _everyone_ receives respect and appreciation for their authentic work.
- Conclusion: dancers, as artist-athletes, need to get immersed in the culture in order to compete

One enlightening insight that I've come across pertains to the concept of communities in sports: the sense of belonging and identity inherently involves forms of exclusion, and this exclusion is intrinsically linked to the idea of belonging itself. This realization struck me as particularly poignant because it drew parallels with the integral role that culture plays in street dance, a sport that holds significant personal meaning for me. Street dance styles, I've come to realize, are not merely sets of movements; they represent cultures. Unfortunately, this crucial cultural dimension often gets overlooked in competitive settings, resulting in these dance styles being reduced to mere physical movements devoid of their rich cultural context. In this essay, I will delve into the history of street dance and argue why it is incumbent upon dancers, who I consider artist-athletes, to preserve and honor this cultural heritage.

Most street dance styles trace their origins to pioneering dancers from marginalized groups, defined by factors such as race, gender, and socioeconomic status. For example, hip-hop emerged in the Black communities of the Bronx as a means of emotional release—a positive alternative to the drugs and violence that plagued the neighborhood due to the enduring effects of segregation. Similarly, krump was birthed in downtown Los Angeles as a response to the lure of violent street gang involvement among young people. Another example is waacking, which found its roots in the gay clubs of Los Angeles, where individuals from poor Black, Latino, and Asian backgrounds sought refuge to express themselves in spite of the oppressive circumstances they faced daily. A common thread running through all these origin stories is that individuals who were excluded from mainstream society created spaces where they could truly belong, and they achieved this through dance.

Today, street dance has achieved unprecedented popularity, evolving from localized art forms into global phenomena. The accessibility of learning street dance has also increased, with dance studios and online videos replacing the necessity of learning on the streets or in clubs. However, this surge in popularity has given rise to a troubling phenomenon: cultural appropriation. Frequently, these styles are adopted and practiced by individuals without due acknowledgment of their cultural origins. One glaring manifestation of this issue is the separation of movements from their cultural contexts. In my personal experience, I learned street dance styles like waacking as a member of my high school's dance crew. My teammates and I would master specific movements, which would then be incorporated into choreographies for dance competitions. Reflecting back, I can vividly recall being taught these styles, but I can't say the same for the history and cultural significance behind them. The problem of cultural appropriation also extends to clothing choices, exemplified by my dance crew's costumes that once featured elements like cornrows and Dashikis—distinctly emblematic of Black culture. At that time, I lacked awareness of the harm in trying to emulate this appearance, even though I wasn't Black myself, highlighting how normalized such behavior was in our dance community. In essence, competitive settings often prioritize superficiality and aesthetics over the profound history and meaning of street dance.

Cultural appropriation is deeply detrimental as it displays a lack of respect for the people and communities that gave birth to these cultures—communities that are often marginalized themselves. These dance styles were created by individuals who grappled with oppressive systems, and it is imperative not to ignore the discomforting origins of these art forms. Renowned Hip Hop instructor and activist Soul Zuberi eloquently emphasizes the gravity of cultural appropriation, stating, "People have lost their jobs, been treated like social pariahs, and spent hours laboring over learning these moves in secret. How can you then do those same moves without demonstrating respect to that struggle? You can’t trivialize the experience." Some might argue that efforts to curtail cultural appropriation create exclusive cultural enclaves, suggesting, for instance, that only specific groups should practice waacking. However, this argument misses the mark. The objective of minimizing cultural appropriation is not to create barriers but to foster mutual respect and appreciation between dominant and minority cultures, ensuring that everyone is duly recognized for their authentic contributions.

Consequently, I firmly believe that dancers, as artist-athletes, must educate themselves about street dance culture if they aspire to compete authentically. In a competition setting, every dancer bears the responsibility of representing their respective style in its truest form. Immersion is arguably the most effective means of gaining this education. Streets and clubs serve as classrooms where cultural context is most palpable, and dancers are best equipped to learn about these cultures in these genuine settings. By getting educated this way, dancers can fully honor the origins and significance of these styles on the competitive stage.
