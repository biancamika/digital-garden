### Biology and Society
#### Biotechnology in Science Fiction
- **Biotechnology** is the ==application of living organisms or their parts or processes for the improvement of human society and the environment.== It's something that we've been doing since 11,000 years ago when humans started domesticating plants and animals, without necessarily knowing the science behind it (proof that the applied science can come before the basic science). 
	- The molecular revolution of the 1970s, when information about DNA, genes, and evolution took big leaps forward, transformed the field not only in real science but also in science fiction.
- Here's the [recording of my introduction on biotechnology](https://youtu.be/0ODNqZ_umuw) during a synchronous session on 10 December for the first semester run of this course
- And here's a [long-ish (at least longer than usual) video discussing some of the history of biotech in sci-fi](https://youtu.be/SsAKACFMquQ), with highlights on cybernetics, genetic engineering, and cloning
- Since **CRISPR-Cas9** is so awesome and will play a critical role in many future biotech innovations perhaps even in sci-fi, let's hear from one of its pioneers, [2020 Nobel Prize for Chemistry winner Jennifer Doudna herself, about how it works](https://youtu.be/_PU5bCflzEM), what its potential uses are, and perhaps most importantly, what we as a society should remember when we use it.
	- Take special note of what she says about CRISPR-Cas9 ==being usable on the germ line, which means that these genetic changes can be inherited.==

**Points for Discussion**
1. How have you personally benefited from biotechnology?
2. Why is biotechnology usually used as the playground of sci-fi/horror works? Is the fear of GMOs, mutants, and genetic abnormalities justified?
3. What biotech-related sci-fi tropes do you find most fascinating and why?
4. How can biotechnology be used to further human evolution and possibly even promote speciation of our species?
5. Professor Doudna discussed four important issues that must be thoroughly discussed in the context of using CRISPR-Cas9. Are these issues limited to the usage of CRISPR-Cas9?
6. How do you feel about the prospect of a future with human clones being a common occurrence? Would you want to be cloned? Why or why not?

#### Biotechnology and Utopia
- Biotechnology, both in fiction and in real life, is usually driven by a pretty simple idea: **the use of nature and its processes for the good of humankind**. 
	- The idea is, if the bodies we currently have, the organisms with which we currently interact, the resources to which we currently have access, and the environments we currently inhabit all play major roles in the lives we lead, so ==why should we not be encouraged to alter them in order to give ourselves better lives?==
- The spirit of biotechnology is heavily informed by the concept of **[[Utopia]]**, "an imagined society in which everything is perfect." 
	- The term comes from the Greek _ou_ ("not") and _topos_ ("place"); a utopia is quite literally a ==non-place.== 
	- Utopia has always been seen as ==unreachable==--for St. Thomas More, who coined the term, it was always _somewhere else_, as the titular utopia in his 1516 work _Utopia_ was an imaginary faraway island, whereas for many people today, the idea of utopia is an impossible, asymptotic vision of a perfect society. 
	- This doesn’t mean utopia is literally impossible, bu==t the concept is informed by impossibility:== the impossibly good, the kind of good so great as to be called perfection.
- Here's the thing: utopia is ==never objective.== Any concept ostensibly founded on the greater good is in fact ==heavily dependent on whose definition of "good" is at play.==
	- The "perfect society" in St. Thomas More's _Utopia_, for example, reflects perfection _as More and his contemporaries saw it_: the society of the text includes an elected Prince who rules for life unless removed due to tyranny, state-controlled household sizes, no private property, no lawyers, priests being allowed to marry, free hospitals, women confessing their sins to their husbands, normalized slavery, and a slew of other characteristics that more than a few people today would likely find objectionable (and not always the same kinds of people).
- As fiction will tell you, most things require tradeoffs, and utopian-leaning science is no exception, in real life or in fiction. And more than telling us what is desirable, ==our vision of the good affects what sacrifices we see as acceptable.== 
	- Would we trade freedom for security, perhaps, or security for freedom? Would we rather live in the harsh reality or the comforting illusion, and would our answer change depending on what our friends and loved ones chose? In biotechnological terms: ==what is immortality worth, and how many people would we sacrifice to save one life?== 
	- It's the classic _Soylent Green_ question: if we could keep everyone fed, would it be okay to use already-dead human remains to do so? What if we killed terminally ill people with no hope of recovery to do so--is that different? What if it were murderers on death row? What if it were the dead body of someone you loved? ==To what extent are we willing to use nature's processes, and for what good, and for whom?==
