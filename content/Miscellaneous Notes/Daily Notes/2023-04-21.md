## Discerning Life Questions
#DLQ10 
### The Book of Job 
- **Why does God allow the Innocent to Suffer?**
- The Book of Job is one of the most beautiful pieces of **Hebrew poetry** in all of the Bible even if it deals with such a harrowing theme.
### "Everything happens for a reason"

- **Supplementary reading:** 
	- This reading is the preface and first two chapters of his book _Where the Hell is God?_ In simple and down-to-earth language filled with stories, this short book brings its readers to a reflection of the mystery of suffering in the Christian tradition.
	- Here is its bibliographical entry:  Leonard, Richard. _Where the Hell is God?:_ Mahwah, NJ: Paulist Press, 2010.
### Jesus' Context
#### [Immersing in a Pool (Jesus is Human)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HV28dGSPicU)
- I miss swimming! (Believe it or not, yes I do swim!) I want to use this as an image to describe what I think the appropriate response to suffering is.
- It will then lead us to a timeless Christian theological question: **Who is Jesus?*
- From here on, we will observe the life and ministry of Jesus Christ as a way of looking at how we can deal with suffering in this world.
#### [Are Crowns Still a Thing? (The Kingdom of God)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJNbkZhhn8w)
- We will talk about whether or not "kingdoms" are still relevant today and why Jesus seems to be promoting one. And what does this have to do with suffering?
### Jesus Before Christianity
- After dealing with who Jesus is, we now focus on His life and mission by asking this next theological question: **How did He respond to the suffering of His time?**
- Answering this question will hopefully lead us to reflect on this other question which is closer to our experience: **Looking at what Jesus did, what do we do with the suffering of our own time?**
- Generations of Ateneans have read this text that you're about to encounter. A lot of them have said that this reading has radically changed how they understand who Jesus is and what He stood for. So trust me when I say that you're in for a treat!
- _**Brief Introduction of the Reading:**_ We seem to forget that Jesus came from a particular historical context. He is a Jewish man from first-century Palestine who dealt with the problems of His day. He was not a white man who dealt with European problems as He is often depicted. That is why Albert Nolan wants us to go back to the Jesus “before Christianity”. He wants us to pay attention to the unique ways that Jesus responded to the problems of His time so that we can see how we ourselves can respond to those problems which still pervade today.
### Suffering - From "A Sacred Voice is Calling"
- To supplement your lessons for this module, let me show one of the most beautiful reflections on suffering I've ever read. I still get chills reading it.
- _**Brief Introduction of the Reading**_
	- In this chapter taken from _A Sacred Voice is Calling_, Neafsey talks about our capacity to be wounded healer's (which is actually a concept coming from Henri Nouwen) and how suffering also has a redemptive character as seen in the passion and death of Jesus.
### Ministry to a Hopeless Man
- For our last course reading, we will return to Fr. Henri Nouwen. This is the third chapter of his book _The Wounded Healer_ (which is one of my personal favorites) _._ In this chapter called "Ministry to a Hopeless Man", Nouwen talks about the need of entering the suffering of someone at the brink of death. The call to Christian leadership is one that is unafraid of suffering, willing to wait in both and life, and always eager to be in solidarity.
- Enjoy! And may you be inspired to heal after reading this text.
#### Supplementary Lecture
- As a supplementary resource for this module, listen to this short talk about hope given by Fr. Michael Himes. He talks about how we can proceed with life hopefully even when things do not go our way. I invite you to watch the whole video, but the meat of the matter for our purposes begins at the 10-minute mark.
