> Each of the abovementioned living cultures manifests itself in design. Think of one example each, and in a few sentences, explain to us why you chose these examples. Be more thoughtful and try to go beyond the obvious.

-  **Kultura ng Pamamanata** (Devotion to the Patron Saint and Village Community)
	- I see *Kultura ng Pamamanata* in medal necklaces, such as the Saint Benedict Medal and the Miraculous Medal. These have always been a staple Filipino accessory, advocated by everyone from trendy Instagram jewelry shops to paraphernalia vendors outside churches. I believe that the longstanding influence of these medals shows the scale of our devotion. A notable example I can think of is Hidilyn Diaz, who proudly wore a Miraculous Medal during her Olympic Gold win.
-   **Kultura ng Pananahan** (Devotion to the Home and Family)
	- I see *Kultura ng Pananahan* in *karaoke*/*videoke*. It's so prevalent in our culture that Filipinos from all social classes have encountered this machine; after all, how can a Filipino house party or family reunion is complete without singing? The *karaoke/videoke*'s cultural significance shows how much we love socializing with others; it also provides space for other exampels of popular culture, such as *senti* love songs.
