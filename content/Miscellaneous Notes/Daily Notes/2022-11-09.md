## Principles and Methods of Teaching
#EDUC130 
### Lesson Plan: Session Design
#### Outline
**OBJECTIVES:**
- They must critically evaluate the messages and/or images of different types of texts reflecting different cultures through written essays. (EVALUATING)
- They should be able to convey ideas through oral, audio-visual, and/or web-based presentations for different target audiences in local and global settings using appropriate registers. (CREATING)

**OUTLINE:**
1. Introduction
	1. Topic: Evaluating Messages and/or Images for Different Types of Cultures
	2. Learning objectives (simplified)
		1. not only will you be able to critically evaluate these texts reflecting diverse cultures...
		2. but also be able to know how to convey ideas for diverse audiences
	3. Agenda for today's session
		1. Messages/texts
		2. Semiotics
		3. Cultural texts
		4. Evaluating messages
		5. Activity
	4. Start with an example prompt? 
		1. E.G. Does anyone here use dating apps? How would you approach online dating?
			1. get answers from the class...expecting answers on reading the way people text (language), judging their aesthetics (signs)
		2. After getting answers, I will point out that they all already know how to evaluate messages (unconsciously)
		3. https://isi.org/intercollegiate-review/tinder-and-semiotics/
2. Talking about texts
	1. Definition of terms
		1. “Message” or text: refers to any recorded message(e.g., writing, audio-recording, audio-and video-recording) that is physically independent of itssender or receiver
		3. To produce a quality text, we need to think of:
			1. Structure: how the information is organized.
			2. Language: the means by which the information is expressed verbally and/or nonverbally.
			3. Presentation: the layout, format, length, oral delivery and any other conventions.
	2. Introduce/review of semiotics
		1. How can we interpret messages? through symbiotics
		2. Definition: the study of signs and symbols, in particular as they communicate things spoken and unspoken In a semiotic sense, signs take the form of words, images sounds, gestures, and objects.
		3. Signs are composed of...
			1. Signifiers (represenations/modalities such as images, sound, etc.)
			2. Signifieds (concepts)
		4. Semiotic systems (more than just visual!)...
			1. Linguistic or textual system: vocabulary, structure, grammarof oral/written language, wordchoice, delivery of spoken orwritten text (tone), organizationinto sentences, phrases,paragraphs.
			2. Visual system: Color, vectors and viewpoint in still andmoving images, layout,style, size, perspective.
			3. Audio system: Volume, pitch andrhythm of music and sound effects.
			4. Gestural system: Movement, facial expression and body language, hand gestures, interactions between people.
			5. Spatial system: Proximity, direction, position of layout,organization of objects in space arrangement.
		5.  Examples: 
			1. emojis (a Japanese word thattranslates in English as "e" for "picture" and "moji" for "character)
			2. emoticons (digitalicons that convey human expressions)
			3. Processing question: ask class what they think is the signifier and the singified in emojis and emoticons 
3. Texts can reflect cultures
	1. Prompt
		1. Since reality is always subject to human interpretation...
		2. ...a person's background will inherently affect their interpretation of reality
	2. Semiotics can refer to a kind of social interaction among individuals who try to make sense out of the different interpretations possibilities of a sign.
		1. This is where culture comes in
	3. Definition: 
		1. Cultural texts are those objects, actions, and behaviors that reveal cultural meanings. 
		2. A photo is an image, but is also a cultural text, a picture with cultural information beyond just the picture itself
	4. Provide examples
		1. Bowing down cartoon
		2. American v.s. japanese parenting cartoon
4. Evaluating Messages
	1. Why do we need to do this? (connect to examples)
		1. If messages are not scrutinized properly, they may become agents of misinformation and lead people to form wrong judgements
		2. By critically evaluating messages, we ensure that the ideas presented are accurate, relevant and appropriate to be posted or shared with everyone
	2. Guide questions:
		1. What is the message of the text?
		2. What is the purpose of the message?
		3. How is the message conveyed by the text and/or image?
		4. Who is the target audience of the message?
		5. What other ways of presenting the message are there?
	3. How to evaluate messages that reflect different cultures:
		1. Understand how the specified cultures live.
		2. How the people in the specified group communicate each other.
		3. Learn the symbolism of their culture.
		4. Be aware in every detail such as artifact, language, and symbolism.
		5. Get the meanings being addressed by the images
		6. Get the important elements conveyed by the images
		7. Getting the audience for the images
	4. Example evaluation
		1. using examples from earlier
5. Class Activity
	1. the whole class will analyze given example: racist Playstation ad
	2. teacher will ask guide questions (questioning sequence), then write notable answers on the board
		1. details: ask them to describe what they see first
		2. categories: ask them to point out what cultures? races? they see represented here
		3. elaborations+ evidence: given all this information, ask them the guide questions
			1. message, purpose of the message, target audience (as intended by the sender/source)
			2. how is this conveyed?
			3. what other ways of presenting the message are there?
