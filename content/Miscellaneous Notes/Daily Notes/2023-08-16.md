### Art and Formal Elements
- What is art?
	- Form - the work itself
	- Function - artistic intent or rationale or form
	- Content/context - what it “says” / significance
- Tip: Don’t bring your baggage into interpreting a work
- Questions:
	- What do I see?
	- What is it made of?
	- What are the words used? What do they mean?
- To understand art, you need to understand history, pop culture, psychology, etc.
	- This is what makes art one of the purest expression of the humanities
- 2 broad categories
	- Plastic arts (tangible)
	- Ephemeral (not permanent)
- Three main distinctions
	- High art
		- Typically seen in museums (white cubes)
		- References more abstract ideals (e.g. feminity)
	- Pop art
		- Like the murals you seen on the street
		- They reference more common/everyday thing
	- Kitsch
		- Looks/emulates high or pop art, but specifically made for consumption
- Aesthetics
	- Is it good or bad?
	- Standards that define Art
	- Art is whatever society/culture says is art
- Formal elements: line, light and value, color, shape and volume, texture, space, time and motion
- Principles of composition: balance, rhythm, proportion and scale, emphasis, unity and variety
- Materials
	- Natural
	- Synthetic
	- Found object

### The Meaning of Art
- 4 Basic Ways
	- Formal Analysis
		- An integrated study of all the formal qualities of an art object to see how they work together
		- An understanding of established conventions
		- Traditions deemed aesthetically satisfying
	- Reading the Context
		- An artwork’s themes or message
		- Surface Content vs Learned Content
		- Subject matter, references
	- Influence of Context
	- Human Encounter and Experience
- Content-Subject Matter
- Content-Iconography
	- Visual metaphors - descriptive elements
	- Symbolic elements - culturally determined
	- Iconography - picture writing used to communicate complex ideas
- Content - Art Writings
	- Art critics, historians, curators, etc.
	- Content is never fixed
	- Five major positions/approaches:
		- Formalist
			- Importance of formal qualities
			- Content/context deemed superfluous
			- Art seen as independent from society/nature
			- Approach is seen to be too narrow
		- Ideological
			- Questions the political implications of art
			- Art in relation to knowledge, discourse, and the operations of power
			- Art is seen to carry and represent ideas that are of significance to society
		- Structuralist
		- Psychoanalytic
		- Feminist
