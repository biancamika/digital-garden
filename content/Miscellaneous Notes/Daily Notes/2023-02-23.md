		- Education for the future (just copy for outline)
			- The biggest culprit is the widespread belief that “soft skills” such as philosophy and history – do not lead to well paid jobs. Many schools and companies emphasize tests in mathematics and English only.  Many students who take humanities see it as a stepping stone to taking other courses like law or business; and, not choose a lifetime career in the humanities.
			 - In an even more algorithmic world, people believe that humanities are irrelevant. Actually, the spread of automation puts a greater premium on qualities that computers lack such as ==intuitive intelligence, management skills and critical reasoning.== Properly taught, that is what a humanities education should provide.
			- "The world, including the Philippines has lost its curiousity about its past. This is one of the greatest risks to democracy. The spread of fake news is often blamed solely on social media. But the ultimate driver is the fact that citizens believe a lot of fake news. ==History is revised without the average citizen contesting the false revisions because of ignorance about its country’s past.=="

- How did the Ancient-Medieval times deal with this issue?
	- Ancient Times
		- China
			- One aim -- preserve and perpetuate the past (a.k.a. traditional beliefs, customs, and way of life) -- can counter this problem. They made sure students memorized history so that they could respect it
				- Morals as a matter of knowledge
				- "truth is what has simply been agreed on in the past, and virtue was an observance of those fixed ideas and customs."
				- Memorization without meaning
				- Moral training was given emphasis...what if one of the 5 virtues was truth?
			- Another aim: Preparing for the civil exam; becoming a good servant
				- Education was designed for maintenance of the status quo, not disruption/innovation. See classical learning
				- Not good for progress?
			- Possible solution: education starts at home, with the family
		- Greece
			- Problem: rote learning and memorization. Solution: informal education, socratic method
	- Medieval Times
		- Monasticism
			- Seven Liberal Arts....there is explicit intention for learning
		- Scholasticism
			- Aim: support the doctrines of the church using rational argument. Intellectual discipline (faith seeking understanding)
				- No to unquestioned obedience to authority...provide a safe space for questioning/inquiry
			- Aquinasa provided a framework for open scientific inquiry
	- Generally though, I'd argue that these eras didn't really solve the problem haha
		- In both eras, it can be seen how curriculums were designed for the sake of the state
- Ideas
	- Social media as the new classroom
	- the dangers of relying on curated information (e.g. modules, social media content)
	- related to instagram activism? lmao
	- importance of media like Maria Ibarra at Klara haha
	- End with a quote from Ambeth Ocampo or something haha

##### Writing

We are living in not just the Information Age, but also the Age of  Information Disorder: a time where all kinds of false, misleading, manipluated, or deceptive information thrives (Wardle, ?). While humans have always been capable of deception, this ability has been amplified by the advent of the Internet. This invention was envisioned to be an utopia: a stateless world where abundant “free” information would equalize social relations and challenge traditional property rights (Cowles, 2009); however, the current state of our cyberspace falls far from this promise. Fake news, conspiracy theories, false claims, and more contaminate our information ecosystem, and this pollution continues to grow thanks to guilty and innocent people alike.  What was designed to connect us is instead dividing us.

This disorder was further exacerbated by the COVID-19 public health crisis. While the virus was spreading globally, so was false and misleading information, creating an infodemic (World Health Organization, n.d.). State leaders from all over the world then used this as an opportunity to gain control over their countries' digital environments, and this can be visibily seen in Southeast Asia. As a region with a long history of governments weaponizing the law, it is considered not just a hub of bad examples of disinformation regulation, but also a hub of disinformation innovations (Corpus Ong, 2021). Here, we can observe the various ways governments enact censorship: from forcing silence (Singapore's "anti-fake-news" law) to encouraging noise (Indonesia's Instagram clickfarm industry). At the center of this crisis is the Philippines, which is considered "patient zero" of the global misinformation epidemic (Rappler, 2018). An army of bloggers, digital influencers, and fake account operators brought Rodrigo Duterte the presidency in 2016. In his term, he incorporated these disinformation workers into the government, thus "institutionalizing" disinformation at the state level (Gaw interviewed by Tuquero, 2022). This paved the way for Bongbong Marcos' victory in 2022, despite his family's controversial legacy. Philippine politics exhibits the weaponization of social media -- it is useful not just for winning the presidency, but also revising history. 

The success of Marcos and his family was not fuelled by social media platforms alone; the influence they've gained online was nurtured by the Philippine education system. When K-12  was implemented in the country, the Philippine History course was removed from the high school curriculum; government representatives believed that Araling Panlipunan (AP) sufficiently covered local history (Ignacio, 2019). However, the way AP is taught in school has played a big part in rehabilitating the Marcos family's image (Santos, 2022). First: the resources at hand are unreliable. AP textbooks often contain errors and misinformation about Marcos Sr. and Martial Law; these would present the former president as a beloved dictator. The accuracy of these books is vital because most AP teachers are not history majors, and end up heavily relying on these. Next: the discussion and analysis of Martial Law is inadequate in both textbooks and classroom instruction. Because of its placement at the tail end of the curriculum (since history is discussed is chronological order)   and frequent class suspensions, many AP teachers do not cover Martial Law in depth -- or do not discuss it at all. Then: the presentation, emphasis, and interpretation of Martial Law is not thorough enough. For instance: when corruption is brought up, too much focus is often placed on the Marcos cronies, and not the Marcos family themselves. Finally: Martial Law education is processed, evaluated, and appreciated subjectively. AP topics are usually taught by making students look at the "positive" and "negative" effects, then asking them to come up with their own conclusion; however, many teachers hesitate or refuse to judge Martial Law due to personal bias, fear, or a false notion of objectivity. 

Now that Marcos Jr. is president, historical revisionism is fully thriving. Content creators outshine  historical and news organizations whenever "Marcos history" is searched on Youtube (Soriano & Gaw, 2021); DepEd modules are now calling Martial Law a period of "The New Society" (Hernando-Malipot, 2022); movies and musicals (i.e. "Maid in Malacañang" and "Here Lies Love") are portraying the Marcos Family in a positive light. Meanwhile, the red-tagging against independent media still persists: "anti-government" books have been pulled out of libraries, bookstores have been vandalized with anti-communist messages, and many journalists have been charged with crimes -- or even worse, killed (Santos, 2022; Demegillo, 2022).  In this post-truth era, Imelda Marcos' words hold true: "Perception is real, the truth is not".  A Philippine Education built on perception holds terrifying consequences for our society.  

So how can we save education from information disorder? Let us first take some inspiration from the past, particularly Ancient China and Medieval Europe.
