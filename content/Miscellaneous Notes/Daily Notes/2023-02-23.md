		- Education for the future (just copy for outline)
			- The biggest culprit is the widespread belief that “soft skills” such as philosophy and history – do not lead to well paid jobs. Many schools and companies emphasize tests in mathematics and English only.  Many students who take humanities see it as a stepping stone to taking other courses like law or business; and, not choose a lifetime career in the humanities.
			 - In an even more algorithmic world, people believe that humanities are irrelevant. Actually, the spread of automation puts a greater premium on qualities that computers lack such as ==intuitive intelligence, management skills and critical reasoning.== Properly taught, that is what a humanities education should provide.
			- "The world, including the Philippines has lost its curiousity about its past. This is one of the greatest risks to democracy. The spread of fake news is often blamed solely on social media. But the ultimate driver is the fact that citizens believe a lot of fake news. ==History is revised without the average citizen contesting the false revisions because of ignorance about its country’s past.=="

	- Ancient Times
		- China
			- One aim -- preserve and perpetuate the past (a.k.a. traditional beliefs, customs, and way of life) -- can counter this problem. They made sure students memorized history so that they could respect it
				- Morals as a matter of knowledge
				- "truth is what has simply been agreed on in the past, and virtue was an observance of those fixed ideas and customs."
				- Memorization without meaning
				- Moral training was given emphasis...what if one of the 5 virtues was truth?
			- Another aim: Preparing for the civil exam; becoming a good servant
				- Education was designed for maintenance of the status quo, not disruption/innovation. See classical learning
				- Not good for progress?
			- Possible solution: education starts at home, with the family
		- Greece
			- Problem: rote learning and memorization. Solution: informal education, socratic method
	- Medieval Times
		- Monasticism
			- Seven Liberal Arts....there is explicit intention for learning
		- Scholasticism
			- Aim: support the doctrines of the church using rational argument. Intellectual discipline (faith seeking understanding)
				- No to unquestioned obedience to authority...provide a safe space for questioning/inquiry
			- Aquinasa provided a framework for open scientific inquiry
	- Generally though, I'd argue that these eras didn't really solve the problem haha
		- In both eras, it can be seen how curriculums were designed for the sake of the state
- Ideas
	- Social media as the new classroom
	- the dangers of relying on curated information (e.g. modules, social media content)
	- related to instagram activism? lmao
	- importance of media like Maria Ibarra at Klara haha
	- End with a quote from Ambeth Ocampo or something haha

##### Writing
###### Draft 1
We are living in not just the Information Age, but also the Age of  Information Disorder: a time where all kinds of false, misleading, manipluated, or deceptive information thrives (Wardle, ?). While humans have always been capable of deception, this ability has been amplified by the advent of the Internet. This invention was envisioned to be an utopia: a stateless world where abundant “free” information would equalize social relations and challenge traditional property rights (Cowles, 2009); however, the current state of our cyberspace falls far from this promise. Fake news, conspiracy theories, false claims, and more contaminate our information ecosystem, and this pollution continues to grow thanks to guilty and innocent people alike.  What was designed to connect us is instead dividing us.

This disorder was further exacerbated by the COVID-19 public health crisis. While the virus was spreading globally, so was false and misleading information, creating an infodemic (World Health Organization, n.d.). State leaders from all over the world then used this as an opportunity to gain control over their countries' digital environments, and this can be visibily seen in Southeast Asia. As a region with a long history of governments weaponizing the law, it is considered not just a hub of bad examples of disinformation regulation, but also a hub of disinformation innovations (Corpus Ong, 2021). Here, we can observe the various ways governments enact censorship: from forcing silence (Singapore's "anti-fake-news" law) to encouraging noise (Indonesia's Instagram clickfarm industry). At the center of this crisis is the Philippines, which is considered "patient zero" of the global misinformation epidemic (Rappler, 2018). An army of bloggers, digital influencers, and fake account operators brought Rodrigo Duterte the presidency in 2016. In his term, he incorporated these disinformation workers into the government, thus "institutionalizing" disinformation at the state level (Gaw interviewed by Tuquero, 2022). This paved the way for Bongbong Marcos' victory in 2022, despite his family's controversial legacy. Philippine politics exhibits the weaponization of social media -- it is useful not just for winning the presidency, but also revising history. 

The success of Marcos and his family was not fuelled by social media platforms alone; the influence they've gained online was nurtured by the Philippine education system. When K-12  was implemented in the country, the Philippine History course was removed from the high school curriculum; government representatives believed that Araling Panlipunan (AP) sufficiently covered local history (Ignacio, 2019). However, the way AP is taught in school has played a big part in rehabilitating the Marcos family's image (Santos, 2022). First: the resources at hand are unreliable. AP textbooks often contain errors and misinformation about Marcos Sr. and Martial Law; these would present the former president as a beloved dictator. The accuracy of these books is vital because most AP teachers are not history majors, and end up heavily relying on these. Next: the discussion and analysis of Martial Law is inadequate in both textbooks and classroom instruction. Because of its placement at the tail end of the curriculum (since history is discussed is chronological order)   and frequent class suspensions, many AP teachers do not cover Martial Law in depth -- or do not discuss it at all. Then: the presentation, emphasis, and interpretation of Martial Law is not thorough enough. For instance: when corruption is brought up, too much focus is often placed on the Marcos cronies, and not the Marcos family themselves. Finally: Martial Law education is processed, evaluated, and appreciated subjectively. AP topics are usually taught by making students look at the "positive" and "negative" effects, then asking them to come up with their own conclusion; however, many teachers hesitate or refuse to judge Martial Law due to personal bias, fear, or a false notion of objectivity. 

Now that Marcos Jr. is president, historical revisionism is fully thriving. Content creators outshine  historical and news organizations whenever "Marcos history" is searched on Youtube (Soriano & Gaw, 2021); DepEd modules are now calling Martial Law a period of "The New Society" (Hernando-Malipot, 2022); movies and musicals (i.e. "Maid in Malacañang" and "Here Lies Love") are portraying the Marcos Family in a positive light. Meanwhile, the red-tagging against independent media still persists: "anti-government" books have been pulled out of libraries, bookstores have been vandalized with anti-communist messages, and many journalists have been charged with crimes -- or even worse, killed (Santos, 2022; Demegillo, 2022).  In this post-truth era, Imelda Marcos' words hold true: "Perception is real, the truth is not".  A Philippine Education built on perception holds terrifying consequences for our society.  So how can we save our education system from the impacts of information disorder? We can get a lot of inspiration from both the past and present.

One era we can learn from is Ancient China. Their concept of education was mostly based on Confusianism: a belief system that focuses on the importance of personal ethics and morality; its influence could be seen everywhere in their education system, from the objectives of education to the ways it was taught. Back then, education was aimed to preserve and perpetuate the past: traditional beliefs, customs, and way of life. The Chinese believed this was needed in order to secure social stability. As a result, ideals and beliefs were the same from generation to generation. To support this educational aim, moral training was emphasized. At the time, moral training revolved around the idea of of noble living; this meant valuing the five relationships and following the five cardinal values. Noble living was also incorporated into their education's content: the Four Books and the Five Classics. The former would discuss abstract values (e.g. moral self-cultivation, devotion to learning, inherent goodness), while the latter would show how these principles were applied to real life (e.g. narrative history, ritual conduct, divination). The methods used in teaching also helped further stress the importance of preserving the past and noble living. Students were required to model essays after sacred writing, along with reciting passages from memory. Aside from rote memorization, there was also the Confucian method of teaching, which expected practical application from students; they learned this by being exposed to the world outside of the classroom, along with developing their own reasoning. Based on what can be seen in this era, the Chinese would definitely have no tolerance for the historical revisionism caused by information disorder. Given that their education also aimed to turn students into civil servants, they would be displeased to see government officials who lack a foundation in history and morals. 

Another era we can also learn from is the Medieval Times, particularly  Monasticism and Scholasticism. In response to moral degeneracy, both of these movements anchored the conception of an educated man on religious piety. They then pursued this ideal through the development of purity and intellect; the former aimed for the salvation of individual souls, while the latter aimed to defend faith through reason. Thus, the types and content of education at the time revolved around God and the church. For instance, the Seven Liberal Arts from Monastic education all had religious purposes. Reading was learnt for studying the sacred books; writing for copying manuscripts; singing for participating in religious cermonies; and calculating for computing times of church festivals. Then, when Scholasticism introduced religious philosophy (a new sytem of philosophizing about theological beliefs), students learned not only how to practice their faith, but also how to stand up for it. Scholasticism was able to impact the secular world thanks to Thomas Aquinas, who taught Western Europe that any human could access great truths whenever they utilized reason. It is thanks to him that the world has a philosophical framework for open scientific inquiry, along with the belief that knowledge can and should come from multiple sources. Based on what can be seen in this era, monks and scholars alike would definitely not approve of the creation and dissemination of false, misleading, manipluated, or deceptive information; it is because these acts go against godly principles (i.e. "Do not bear false witness") and cannot be defended properly.

In our present times, when it comes to fighting information disorder, the Philippines can learn a lot from Finland -- Europe's most resistant nation to the post-truth phenomenon (Open Society Institute, 2018). According to Juha Pyykkö, Finland's ambassador to the Philippines, the country was successful because of two things: trust and education (PamPastor, 2022). Trust helps because it is an important concept in Finnish culture. Due to this, the media is highly trusted by the Finnish, which in turn make them less likely to turn to alternative news sources. This value also enables a multi-sectoral approach against disinformation; government, business, civil society, academia, etc. get together to design the policies and decide calls to action. Education helps because it equips the Finnish with the tools to deal with disinformation. Multi-platform information literacy and strong critical thinking are a core cross-subject component of the national curriculum; math shows how easy it is to lie with statistics, art displays how an image's meaning can be easily manipluated, history dissects notable propaganda campaigns, and language exhibits the many ways words can be used for deception (Henley, 2020). Irregardless of background, every Finn gets access to this same curriculum, for they believe in comprehensive and equal education. 

While differing contexts makes it difficult to copy Finland's strategy, Filipinos can rebuild trust and education in their own ways. First, by supporting the media. Working in media is difficult due to its typically low wage and life-endangering nature (for journalists); thus, initiatives such as the International Fund for Public Interest Media and the Freedom Fund for Filipino Journalists are crucial for keeping the field alive. Next, by embracing technology. "Truth influencers" have been utilizing social media for themselves in order to fight information disorder. For instance, on Tiktok, academic Francis Gealogo shares history facts, and journalist Lian Buan shares news reports; meanwhile, on Instagram, independent media like Media Commoner disseminate research through digestible carousels. Finally, by pushing for regulation. Third party fact-checkers help keep social media platforms in check; however, these platforms still need to be held accountable for their influence. This is where legislation comes in. But Maria Ressa (2021) believes that this should be the focus of lawmakers, instead of anti-fake news bills (which can be easily abused by the government). Europe's Digital Services Act Package, which aims to create a safer digital environment, could be a great model for this.

###### Draft 2

- How Historical eras tackle information disorder 
	- their aims 
		- China: preserving the past, noble living
		- Europe: salvation of souls, defending faith through reason
	- their content and methods
		- they had figures/influencers as role models: Confucius and Saint Thomas Aquinas... embodiments of these aims
		- their education reflected these values, so that they wouldn't be forgotten
		- reliant on memory: memorization, exact imitation (give both examples of China and Europe)
		- practical application: Confucian method, debate...framework for open scientific inquiry
			- both show the belief that knowledge can come from multiple sources


- Comparison paragraph
	- Identify similarities/differences between the past and the present
		- similarities
			- aims: we too are driven by belief systems
		- differences
			- rote memorization is not as important as before
	- Compare/ Contrast the contexts and factors that affected the issue/trend in the past and the present.
		- geography 
			- The geographic features of China isolated it from other regions. Consequently, the Chinese became self-sufficient and learned to value collectivism.
			- Simiarily, the Philippines is an archipegalo with thousands of islands. Because of this, we are divided from one another. Filipinos are isolated from themselves. 
				- this makes it easier to spread false information...to places isolated (no TV too) 
		- religion
			- moral degeneracy
			- ^ as a primarily Catholic country, religion heavily defines Philippine education. 
			- spiritial groups can be used as tools for fighting or disseminating disinformation

				- https://www.ucanews.com/news/phil-catholics-urged-to-fight-misinformation-fake-news/99903
		- society (particularly socioeconomic class)
			- a hirerachy of social class
			- prevalent in the past
			- still exists in the present
				- anti-masa back then, anti-masa even now
