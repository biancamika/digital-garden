		- Education for the future (just copy for outline)
			- The biggest culprit is the widespread belief that “soft skills” such as philosophy and history – do not lead to well paid jobs. Many schools and companies emphasize tests in mathematics and English only.  Many students who take humanities see it as a stepping stone to taking other courses like law or business; and, not choose a lifetime career in the humanities.
			 - In an even more algorithmic world, people believe that humanities are irrelevant. Actually, the spread of automation puts a greater premium on qualities that computers lack such as ==intuitive intelligence, management skills and critical reasoning.== Properly taught, that is what a humanities education should provide.
			- "The world, including the Philippines has lost its curiousity about its past. This is one of the greatest risks to democracy. The spread of fake news is often blamed solely on social media. But the ultimate driver is the fact that citizens believe a lot of fake news. ==History is revised without the average citizen contesting the false revisions because of ignorance about its country’s past.=="

		- The Miseducation of the Filipino
			- colonization of education
- Problem
	- historical revisionism
		- rooted in...history is easily warped because we haven't been taught to value it in our education...we don't understand it's meaning
		- connected to...lack of value for the humanities 
- Solution (in present times)
	- truth-fluencers like Ambeth Ocampo, Lian Buan
	- https://aseanmp.org/2022/09/05/a-10-point-plan-to-address-our-information-crisis/
- How did the Ancient-Medieval times deal with this issue?
	- Ancient Times
		- China
			- One aim -- preserve and perpetuate the past (a.k.a. traditional beliefs, customs, and way of life) -- can counter this problem. They made sure students memorized history so that they could respect it
				- Morals as a matter of knowledge
				- "truth is what has simply been agreed on in the past, and virtue was an observance of those fixed ideas and customs."
				- Memorization without meaning
				- Moral training was given emphasis...what if one of the 5 virtues was truth?
			- Another aim: Preparing for the civil exam; becoming a good servant
				- Education was designed for maintenance of the status quo, not disruption/innovation. See classical learning
				- Not good for progress?
			- Possible solution: education starts at home, with the family
		- Greece
			- Problem: rote learning and memorization. Solution: informal education, socratic method
	- Medieval Times
		- Monasticism
			- Seven Liberal Arts....there is explicit intention for learning
		- Scholasticism
			- Aim: support the doctrines of the church using rational argument. Intellectual discipline (faith seeking understanding)
				- No to unquestioned obedience to authority...provide a safe space for questioning/inquiry
			- Aquinasa provided a framework for open scientific inquiry
	- Generally though, I'd argue that these eras didn't really solve the problem haha
		- In both eras, it can be seen how curriculums were designed for the sake of the state
- Ideas
	- Social media as the new classroom
	- the dangers of relying on curated information (e.g. modules, social media content)
	- related to instagram activism? lmao
	- importance of media like Maria Ibarra at Klara haha
	- End with a quote from Ambeth Ocampo or something haha
