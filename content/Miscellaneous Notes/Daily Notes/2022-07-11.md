> Share two screenshots: one scene or moment from each of the films. In a few sentences, explain to us why these two images stood out for you.

The former shot from *You Are the One (2006)* depicts Sam and Will having a cute romantic moment together in the fiesta. The latter shot from *Anino (2006)* depicts a child from the slums attempts to take a picture with a (stolen?) camera. Both of these images struck me because of their (arguably Filipino-like) optimism; the characters in all of these scenes are trying to make the most out of their dismal circumstances — whether it be being drenched in rain and mud, or living in extreme poverty.

### Reflect

- What happened?
	- Will tries to apologize to Sam by making excuses for his behavior. He says that abandoment issues causes him to not have a heart. Sam tells him otherwise.
	- Garcia-Molina distinguishes the clear-cut yet dull lifestyle of Will from the seductive chaos of Sally's life (complete with her two best friends: a standard gay sidekick (Gio Alvarez) and lovelorn internet dater (Eugene Domingo)). Their workplaces spell out bureaucracy but the professionally boring straightness of the U.S. Embassy feels very clinical as compared to the crowd-infested yet always pleasant (something I wish were true in real life) madness of the statistics office. It is that allure that tempts Will to re-discover himself and open up to the possibilities of taking part in it.
- Millieu
	- decline of commercial films; Hollywood films dominated; formulaic romantic comedies constituted the majority of mainstream releases.
	- Rom-coms really took off in the early 2000s
	- Filipinos vs American culture
		- Comparison of Filipino and American expression, as seen in Sam and Will
			- low context v.s. high context
			- LINEAR VERSUS CIRCULAR WAY OF COMMUNICATION
			- AFFECTION THROUGH VERBAL AFFIRMATION VERSUS AFFECTION THROUGH DEMONSTRATION
		- Filipino's colonial mentality; blurred the Filipino identity
			- brought about by decades of U.S. cultural imperialism and neo-colonialism.
			- "American Dream", visa application, English V.S. introduction to filipino culture and language
			-  filmmakers can foster counter-hegemonic ideas under the guise of the popular melodrama,comedy or fantasy genre; hence creating a truly Filipino alternative cinema.
			- Filipino movie’s fondness for scene-oriented narratives, overt representation, circumlocutory dialogue, and storiesthat emphasized on the centrality of the star
			- we must go against oppressive formalist standards, which are defined by the West
			- filmmakers can make use of existing movie genres; subverting and reinveting its traditional narrative modes with subtle depictions of globalization and American neo-imperialism. this is so it feels like a continuous development from the past, versus alienating indies
			- objective of alternative cinema is not simply to entertain — it must strive to "Filipinize" the Filipino masses
				- this is what happend to Will
			- How can Philippine cinema search for a truly Filipino identity amidst the market-driven natureof the movie industry and the hegemonic dominance of Hollywood
- Direction, production
	- Cathy Garcia
		- best known for directing romantic comedy films produced and distributed by Star Cinema
		- It's not the formulaic plot that gets the film going, but Cathy Garcia-Molina's astute direction. She finds whimsical in dire situations. While the late Lino Brocka, and his successors, would've made grave drama about the living conditions of Tondo, Garcia-Molina finds gems of human ingenuity. The rooftop of a squalid apartment becomes filled with colorful tents and bright umbrellas that shield gamblers and afternoon drunkards from the gaze of the sun; two buildings are connected by a string that allows laundry to be brought to and fro; women drag their children like a hen dragging her set of chicks. It is that unexplainable cosmos of survivors and their survival techniques that the Americans (in this case, Will) would never understand; and that's what Garcia-Molina forwards so wonderfully.
		- That run-of-the-mill ending of all romantic comedies wherein the male lover chases after his female lover (or vice versa) which is always against time, circumstance, or calamity is pumped up by Garcia-Molina and her team of imaginative writers, made distinctly Filipino by an adherence to exaggeration and over-the-top histrionics. This time, it works mostly because Garcia-Molina has consistently made it work ever since the first scene where time-tied Sally hilariously un-knots a traffic jam to the real, from ridiculous and enjoyable party-poverty in Tondo to the half-buried yet still habitable houses of Pampanga. It's a string of fascinating sequences and all of them are genuinely enjoyable. I do not kid.
		- "I am directing because I want to tell stories. And who are the stories for? Hindi naman sa critics. I never did films for them. I do films for the audience. Kasi sila talaga yung talagang manunuod at magbabayad para mapanood ng pelikula ko."
		- grew up with no dreams (put in connect instead)
	- relying on the traditional formula of big stars in crowd-pleasing tales with happy endings.
- Circulation
	- people loved their chemistry
	- break box office records
	- "Everytime they watch my films, nakakatulong, nakagaan ng pakiramdam nila."; "Nabalikan kami sa pelikula mo." -- priceless to her. she seeks superlatives

	- kiliggg

	- Wait, this movie is so commercial
	- Cathy Garcia-Molina

	- Her movies may be box office successes, but what she cares most about is the impact left on the audience
	- “alternative cinema”; a cinema that is made to serve, first and foremost, the Filipino masses; a cinema that makes the masses its true subject.
	- our hearts

"Meron kang puso, Will. Broken, oo. Pero hindi missing."

In this scene, Will tries to excuse his behavior towards Sam, believing that he lacks a heart because of abandonment issues. Sam tells him otherwise, and berates him for not even trying to care (whether it’s looking for his birth parents or respecting Sam’s feelings). This line of dialogue struck me the most because of the message it sends: no matter what’s happened to us, we still have hearts — and it’s up to us to make the most out of them. I also see this connected to Filipino culture. Despite centuries of colonization, there is still an essence that is truly Filipino; it just needs to be brought out. And this can be done through art that showcases a truly Filipino identity, such as *You Are the One (2006)*. 

In fact, I'd consider this film an example of what scholar Elvin Valerio (n.d.) calls "a truly Filipino alternative cinema". But how does this qualify for such After all, this film is the epitome of commercial; as a romantic-comedy produced and distributed by industry giant Star Cinemas, it ascribes to the same traditional formula: big stars, crowd-pleasing tales, happy endings. According to Valerio, alternative cinema must act as an instrument of decolonization. One way this can be done is going against oppressive formalist standards that are often defined by the West. Traits that film critics see as inferior (e.g. scene-oriented narratives, overt representation, circumlocutory dialogue, and emphasis on the main star) must be fully embraced by local filmmakers. Valerio suggests that alternative filmmakers can make use of popular movie genres; then, they can reinvent its traditional narrative modes with subtle hints of globalization and neo-imperialism. This approach ensures the development of a critical consciousness without alienating Filipino audiences. Overall, the objective of alternative cinema is not simply to entertain — it must strive to "Filipinize" the Filipino masses .

This is exactly what director Cathy Garcia-Molina does with her films; she breathes new life into formulaic plots by giving them a distinctly Filipino twist. According to critic Oggs Cruz (2007), this is because she's able to find the whimsical in dire situations. For example: by making use of exaggeration and over-the-top histrionics, she's able to show how *pakikisama* transforms dim places into lively communities (e.g. the sterile NSA office, the dirty slums of Tondo, the ash-filled environment of Pampanga). At the same time, she's also capable of social commentary, specifically American culture and its influence on Filipino colonial mentality; this is shown through the characters of Sam and Will. They both have family ties to the United States: Sam's family is pursuing the "American Dream", while Will is part of the Fil-Am disapora. However, their different backgrounds cause them to clash in terms of communcation. An example of this is low context expression of American culture versus high context expression of Filipino culture; the former relies on verbal and direct communication, while the latter relies on using non-verbal cues, dropping hints,  and using humor/euphemism (Samuels, 2020).  Thus, whenever Sam is mad, Will struggles to understand her because she is never direct with him. 

In the end, it could be said that both protagonists now have a greater understanding of not just themselves, but also what it means to be Filipino. This is not only seen in their explorations of Tondo and Pampanga, but also in the strengthening of their close ties. I'm sure that their experience resonated with a lot of Filipinos; I believe that Garcia-Molina's films are constant box office successes because the stories she tells hit close to home. What she values the most isn't rave reviews or high earnings, but the reception of her audience; for her, hearing that her films help bring comfort and relief to people is priceless (Gonzalez, 2021). This is why I consider her films as "alternative cinema". This cinema serves the Filipino masses by making them its true subject (Valerio, 2020). For Garcia-Molina, service is spotlighting Filipino hearts on the big screen.

***"But are you a real human being?"***

In *Anino (2000)*, the scene that struck me the most was the conversation between a church photographer (played by Ronnie Lazaro) and his harsh critic (played by John Arcilla). The critic speaks cruelly: he tells the photographer that no one will pay him for his job, he calls him an opportunist, and he says that he is wasting his life. According to him, real people aren't found in the church; instead, they're found outside, in the streets of Manila. This drives away the photographer, who ends up running into more fortunes — such as having his camera stolen and getting arrested after a fight. 

I appreciate this line of dialogue because it encapsulates how dehumanizing living in Manila (and by extension, the Philippines) can be, especially when you're from an unprivileged background (i.e. poor photographer from the province). The protagonist of this film is treated as less than a person. Aside from being nameless, he is also constantly having something taken away from him. The critic questions his philosophy. The child steals his camera. The driver and the police destroy his dignity (and possibly his life). Thanks to these people, everything he once had is now gone.

Why are these absurd characters considered "real", while these devout churchgoers are not? Perhaps it's because of cynicism. It could be argued that these characters were being authentic to themselves, while the churchgoers are hypocritical. According to the critic, they believe themselves to be powerful, when in reality they're being used by higher forces to inflict harm on others. I saw this as a commentary of how classism is embedded in the Filipino religious experience. This is not only seen in our present (e.g. extravagant consumerism during Christmas, religious universities seen as elitist institituions), but also in our past (e.g. Spanish friars abusing positions of power). After all, if Christ’s gospel advocates for love, compassion, justice and peace, why does this predominantly Catholic society tolerate the shockingly inhuman conditions of the masses (Carvajal, 2020)?

 *Anino (2000)* is depressing, but it's a brilliant reflection of society's inequality. This was the objective of director Raymond Red. As one of the pioneers of modern Filipino alternative cinema, he played a role in the Third Golden Age of Philippine cinema: an era defined by independent flmmakers who weren't afraid to show serious societal issues (Dorsch, 2022). Multiple factors influenced this development: the rise of the digital medium, high taxes on films, local political turmoil (Labrador, 2001; Dorsch, 2022). Despite the dire circumstances, Red was relentlessly dedicated to his craft; he even said: "I don't make films to be liked...I make them to capture reality. Some won't like the vision." (Palanca, 2000). Unfortunately, this devotion was costly. Even if his work received critical acclaim, many didn't like his vision (e.g. big studios and local critics), and he almost went bankrupt making *Anino*. He eventually had to resort to freelance commercial work in order to fuel his artistic pursuits.

I believe Red was able to depict dehumanization so well because of his personal experience with it. Perhaps he saw himself in the broke photographer. I wonder if he also struggled with the same criticism. How does he feel balancing TV commercials and indie films? Does he think he's an opportunist for creating films on societal issues? Is he now a complete cynic, or does he still have hope for his industry and society? This film may be two decades old, but I'm sure that these struggles are still relevant today.

What's the relationship between desires and dreams? The former can be seen as temporary self-centered wants, while the latter can be seen as long-term aspirations for something bigger than ourselves. With this definition in mind, it can be said that most Filipinos have desires, but not dreams. Around 8 to 10 Filipinos do not have a dream (Joaquin, 2022); even director Cathy Garcia-Molina admitted, "Lumaki ako walang dream" (de los Reyes, 2020). According to Chanco (2022), this is because most Filipinos, being poor, are operating on survival mode. This can be seen in Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs; you're not capable of seeking self-actualization if you're worried about getting to eat everyday. The dreams most Filipinos get to have are often individualistic, extending to at most family and friends (e.g. being a housewife, working and migrating abroad). 

This can be seen in the protagonists of both films. Sam and Will of *You Are the One (2006)* were both quite content with their own lifestyles. Their goals at the time were individualistic in nature, and were imparted to them by their families (e.g. getting a US visa, finding your birth parents). The nameless photographer of *Anino (2000)* has something closer to a dream: making a living doing what he loves. However, his unfortunate circumstances forces him to give up on this for the sake of survival. 
Despite the "lacking" scale of their dreams, all of the films' protagonists are gravely affected when they're taken away, becoming shells of their former selves. After running into a disappointing false alarm, Will recedes to his distant playboy behavior. After losing his camera, the photographer seems to lose the will to live. Without dreams, we become less than human.

How can Filipinos develop the capacity to dream big? According to Joaquin (2022), we'd need the following: encouraging conversations, inspiring role models, an expanded perspective, available opportunities, and abundant resources. And I believe that Philippine cinema can play a key role in capacity-building. Their stories can start discussions and open our minds. The audience can look up to everyone working in the industry, from cast to crew. This space is a great space to grow dreams. Perhaps it could even be the birthplace of a collective national dream or a sense of nationhood — both things we lack (Chanco, 2022). For instance, director Raymond Red saw his award as a new sign of hope for all of us Filipinos; he hoped that "...this would prove the Filipino filmmaker is as good as any in the world." (Vera, 2007). And this dream is no longer only his; as seen in the rise of local filmmakers, it is the dram of many Filipinos as well.
