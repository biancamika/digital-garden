### Assignment 1: The personal response
#### Task
Here is a quote about modernism from Filipino poet and Ateneo teacher, Mr. Ramon 'Rayvi' Sunico:

>_Before modernism, our eyes were windows through which we saw reality. In modernism, our eyes have become screens onto which we project the only reality we know for sure, our consciousness._

In 750-1200 words, explain this quote in light of everything you learned from module 1. To support your answer, **provide ideas from _Demian_, from the input given on module 1, and your own personal experience.** Your answer should also play close attention to describing the **difference between _windows_ and _screens_.** I will look for a **central argument** in your submission and a well-**supported position.**

> For assignments 1 and 2, revisions are allowed so long as you submit on time. If you submit earlier than the deadline or exactly on the deadline, you may revise your work. If you submit after the deadline, no more revisions are possible. Revisions will be due up to the point when I close the assignment (usually within a week after the deadline).

![[Miscellaneous Notes/Daily Notes/2023-02-01#Reading "Demian"]]

- My central argument (thesis statement): We need to learn the art of seeing in order to live our lives to the fullest
	- "Eyes as windows to the soul"
	- “With a truly tragic delusion,” Carl Jung noted, “these theologians fail to see that it is not a matter of proving the existence of the light, but of blind people who do not know that their eyes could see. It is high time we realized that it is pointless to praise the light and preach it if nobody can see it. It is much more needful to teach people ==the art of seeing.”==
		- from Jung, C. G. (1968). _Psychology and alchemy_ (H. Read, M. Fordham, G. Adler, & W. McGuire, Eds., R. F. C. Hull, Trans.). Princeton University Press. (Original work published 1944)
			- understanding of visioning—the “art of seeing”—as his pathway to individuation and inner rebirth.
			- Jung would again chastise modern man’s inability to establish the necessary, living connection between outer images and the depths of inner life. Psychology, he claimed, “is concerned with the act of seeing.” More to the point, in a world where the blind are leading the blind, it befalls psychology “to teach people the _art_ of seeing”
			- What really matters in Jung’s recollections are not the details he reminisces about per se, but rather what he has to say about the ==inner process== as it begins to occur and as it unfolds; in this case not only did he notice what was intervening beyond the horizon of consciousness, but as he became aware of it, he also made room for more to arise. ==Consciousness was, as it were, instantly put in the service of the unconscious==; the outer eye made to provide for the inner eye, so that “the equivalent images … lying dormant in [his] own unconscious” (Jung, [Citation1944/1968](https://www.tandfonline.com.oca.rizal.library.remotexs.co/doi/full/10.1080/00332925.2022.2082794#), para. 14) could awaken and find their way out. It is through the ==joint operation of outer and inner vision== that the art of seeing that is so central to Jung’s psychology becomes woven—like a gossamer thin fabric at the seamless junctures of multiple levels of reality.
- My position (overall stance that the writer of an essay takes in answering the question or on the issue/topic at hand): 
	- topic: defining modernism
	- my stance on it: we need to be aware of this screen. we can't destroy it, but we can accept it? instead of seeing this screen as a clouded window, we can see it as a mirror
- Difference between windows and screens: 
	- Windows are transparent, while screens are opaque
	- As a noun: a window is an opening that allows the external world inside, while a screen acts as a physical divider. It can be intended to block an area from view or protect from something dangerous
		- note that screen as a verb is synonymous with filter
	- Windows show us the outside world, while screens reflect ourselves
	- Before modernism: We see the world as it is
	- [[Cards/Modernism]]: Basically we project our internal world into the external world
- Demian
	- how reality is created by our own perceptions as opposed to the perceptions of others
		- displayed by Sinclair...he classified people as either belonging to the light or dark world
		- This world is exemplified by Abraxas, who is both luminosity and darkness
	- why the journey to the self can be terrifying
		- you can withdraw into yourself, lost to others
	- how collective action can actually both enrich and obliterate the self
		- enrich
			- Pistorius
			- meeting Demian and his mother
		- obliberate
			- social drinking
			- war
	- favorite quotes
		- _"All I wanted to do was to try to live the life that was inside me, trying to get out. Why was that so hard?"_ 
			- Sinclair identifies tensions of the modernist (e.g. social expectations, political issues, war)
		- “If you hate a person, you hate something in him that is part of yourself. What isn't part of ourselves doesn't disturb us.”
		- On intuition
			- “Gaze into the fire, into the clouds, and as soon as the inner voices begin to speak... surrender to them. Don't ask first whether it's permitted, or would please your teachers or father or some god. You will ruin yourself if you do that.”
			- “I have been and still am a seeker, but I have ceased to question stars and books; I have begun to listen to the teaching my blood whispers to me.”
		- Indiviualism v.s. collectivism
			- “I live in my dreams — that's what you sense. Other people live in dreams, but not in their own. That's the difference.”
			- “Those who are too lazy and comfortable to think for themselves and be their own judges obey the laws. Others sense their own laws within them.”
- Freud & Jung
	- "[[Sources/The Undiscovered Self]]"
	- Takeaway: Authenticity opens the path towards self-realization. We must not repress our darkness, but rather confront it.
- My personal experience
	- Have I found true self-knowledge? I feel like this will be a lifelong quest
	- I feel seen; I feel like I have a mark of cain
		- May be caused by trauma
		- Perhaps that's why I can connect to others with similar trauma, due to similar lifeworlds
		- My [[Shadow self]]: the worst characteristics of my parents?
			- Compensatory role
			- Only harmful when ignored
			- The shadow contains pure gold as psychological insight waiting to be integrated into our personality
			- [[Cards/Shadow work]]: the practice that includes self-awareness, watching one's emotional reactions, being radically honest, and paying attention to one's dreams ^f21d12
	- ideas: Filipino families and their desires for perfection

##### Outline
###### Draft 1
1. Introduction
	1. Hook: 
		1. Humanity has a deep fear of the unknown, and this shows in how we treat our unconscious.
			1. Thinking with your brain is deemed rational, while following your heart is considered irrational.
			2. This then extends to the disregard of the individual in mass society
		2. But instead of regarding our psyche as an inflictor of blindness, what if we viewed it as a new kind of sight?
		3. This is the question brought up by modernism
	2. Thesis statement: Modernism shows us that that an objective reality is nonexistent to us; this is because we always perceive it subjectively, through the lens of our psyche.
		1. Give a summary of essay? To transition?
2. Windows versus Screens 
	1. The modern condition acts as a screen; unlike windows, which show us the external world, screens reflect our internal world.
		1. I believe that there is so much more meaning hidden underneath this statement. 
	2. To uncover this, I want to dissect the function of windows and screens by analyzing them as forms of media. Both of these objects stand in between spaces (e.g. outdoors-indoors; physical-digital), which enables them to *mediate* the viewing experience between them. Thus, our views are dictated by windows and screens. 
		1. One may assume that the transparency of windows allows only truthful perspectives, while the opaqueness of screens enables the imagination to go wild.
		2. But are they really as different as we think? This is something I'd like to counter. 
	3. Windows
		1. While windows provide clear views of what is outside, they can  also conceal us from what is on the other side.
		2. The main reason is their function as a barrier, physically separating us from the other side. 
		3. This produces an effect of paranormic perception, wherein we disassociate ourselves from the objects we watch because they belong to a different space. 
		4. And just as the window separates humans from objects, gazing  from behind a window separates us from the people we see. 
			1. This division provides a kind of invisibility, explaining why people-watching is such an appealing activity. Perceiving strangers face-to-face is uncomfortable; having a safe space to watch from (like a building or car) removes this tension, which frees us to observe and judge other people.
			2. However, this invisibility inherently clouds our perspective; the people we see outside are reduced to our perceptions of them. 
				1. What windows represent: "That is how we see the world: we see it existing outside ourselves, and yet we have only a mental representation of it inside ourselves.	
		5. And in line with this, we are reminded of how windows frame our views.
			1. This goes both ways. Take for example a building. Those inside it get a fixed view of the world outside, while those outside it get a fixed view of the building's interior.
			2. We can apply this to our internal perception and external presentation. The world as we see it will always be defined by our psyche; meanwhile, the way we are seen in the world  will always be defined by social identifiers. 
		6. Thus, I'd argue that windows are actually screens.
			1. Despite promising authenticity through transparency, the  incomplete views they provide inherently create their own reality.
			2. This is the modern perspective.
	4. Screens
		1. As exemplified by windows, the screen as a medium is seemingly neutral, yet apparently biased. It affects the viewer through manipluation, which manifests in many ways:
		2. First, screens manipluate **bodies.**
			1. Screens serve as safeguards. They can do this by acting as dividers, buffers, and protectors.
			3. However, this form of protection can also become a means of enclosure.
				1. The same walls used to shield people from the elements can also be used to detain them.
				2. Similarily, our psyches can act as prisons. They could lead us to withdraw into ourselves, closing us off from the people around us. 
		3. Second, screens manipluate **information.**
			1. Screens function as filters, simultaenously transmitting and translating the information it intercepts.
			2. This inherently involves exclusion, for interpretation is impossible without this. When information is processed to be comprehendible, there will always be meaning lost in translation. Thus, the screen becomes as a censor.
			3. This kind of censorship can be seen in the mass society's approach to knowledge. Due to its rational viewpoint, collective and scientific knowledge is valued more than self-knowledge.
				1. Add more examples from Jung chapter 1
		4. Third, screens manipluate **images.**
			1. Screens serve as both displays and masks. Take for example Plato's Allegory of the Cave. Acting as a screen, the cave wall presents shadows to the prisoners while also concealing the objects these shadows come from. What this shows us is that both neutrality and bias can be found in a screen's projection.
			2. This paradox is also exemplified by psychological dualism — the human person's capacity for good and evil. Our split condition can fragment our image of reality, dividing it into worlds of light and darkness. If we fail to acknowledge our divided nature, we could end up projecting evil onto others, for this is easier to do compared to recognizing evil in ourselves.
		5. Finally, screens manipluate **memory.**
			1. At first, screens are seen as reflective surfaces, displaying only what is in front of it. But mass media like television, films, and websites show how screens can also act as storage. So what if screens could store experience? Just as screens censor information, experiences conveyed by screens would become inherently warped.
			3. This is best shown by Sigmund Freud's concept of the screen memory: a seemingly trivial childhood memory that is used to cover an associated significant memory. People unwittingly use screen memories to protect themselves from repressed traumas or desires. 
			4. Here, we can see how the psyche screens our experiences to leave us with acceptable memories; these screen memories then enable us to maintain the fiction of a stable identity.
3. Reflection
	1. What we can take away from the analogy of windows and screens is that all we see through the lens of modernism is our shadowy internal life.  This life can affect our external world by alienating us from others, restricting our learning, tainting our perceptions, and repressing our memories. Despite the darkness it holds, our psyche only becomes truly detrimental to us when is ignored; by acknowledging its influence, we can learn to live with it. 
	2. The key to this lies in self-knowledge, which we can acquire through exploring our unconscious. Contrary to common belief, our shadow self need not be an enemy; if we address this self (a.k.a. shadow work), we would gain psychological insights that we could then integrate into our personality. 
	3. I myself can vouch for the benefits of this process. 
		1. Growing up in a psychologically and financially difficult family situation has deeply scarred me. 
		2. I believed this "marked" me for life, deeming me an outcast in a culture driven by close ties. For me, it explained why it was so hard to connect with most people; only those who experienced similar circumstances could bear getting close to me. 
		3. I became a workaholic, pursuing success in hopes of covering this "mark", but this trauma continued to bleed into my life; this would end up causing harm to myself and my loved ones.
		4. Setting aside the time to process my experiences (through conversations with friends, therapists, and myself) enabled me to reframe my mindset. My trauma may have clouded my perpsective of reality, but I believe it has also enrichened it, for it gives me a deeper understanding of human nature. In the past, I assumed the worst in people; now, I understand that everyone comes from a place of pain, and those who hurt others simply haven't addressed their own pains. I wouldn't have been able to adopt this viewpoint if I haven't gone through my own suffering.
	4. Thus, I call everyone to embrace this way of seeing. Reality as we know it may not exist, but modernism shows us that we have the power to create our own reality. So will you choose to stay blind, or keep your eyes open? 

- in the age of mass communication, windows give us flat images
- windows are static, while screens are always changing
- screens and willpower
	- we can chooose what to see
- acts as a filter...an inherently biased function. Screens both handle and sense the information it intercepts. Knowledge that passes through this filter exhibits bias
- The screen as a translator become   corrupted. ==The bias of the message of the translator encloses the receptor   from the true information.== Screening fundamentally involves such exclusion because it is an inherent characteristic of the screen; it cannot interpret   without excluding. Thus man, already dependent on information, becomes dependent   on the screen for censorship.
- eyes as windows to the soul?
- Authenticity opens the path towards self-realization. We must not repress our darkness, but rather confront it.

The same walls used to shield people from the elements can also be used to detain them. Similarly, our psyches can act as prisons. They could lead us to withdraw into ourselves, isolating us from others.

Second, screens manipulate information. Screens function as filters, simultaneously transmitting and translating the information they intercept. But inherently involves exclusion; when information is processed to be comprehensible, there will always be meaning lost in translation. Thus, the screen enables censorship. This can be seen in society's approach to knowledge, wherein collective and scientific knowledge is valued more than self-knowledge. As a result, an individual’s insight and reflection is often crushed, making them vulnerable to ideological fanaticism.

Third, screens manipulate images. Screens serve as both displays and masks. We can see this in Plato's Allegory of the Cave; acting as a screen, the cave presents shadows to the prisoners while also concealing the objects these shadows come from.

Just as screens censor information, experiences conveyed by screens would become inherently warped. This is best shown by the screen memory: a seemingly trivial childhood memory that is used to repress an associated significant memory, such as a life-changing trauma or deviant desire. Here, we can see how the psyche screens our experiences to leave us with acceptable memories; these memories then enable us to maintain the fiction of a stable identity.

 What windows and screens show us is that all we see through the lens of modernism is our internal life. This can affect our external world by alienating us from others, restricting our learning, tainting our perceptions, and repressing our memories.

4. Connection to Personal Life


- Self-realization is a Lifelong process...“I have been and still am a seeker, but I have ceased to question stars and books; I have begun to listen to the teaching my blood whispers to me.”

- Screens can manipluate our bodies, information, images, and memories.
	-  find a focus?
	- Screens show us how all we see through the lens of modernism is our internal life


- just because it isn't bonafide (it deceives) doesn't mean it isn't real
