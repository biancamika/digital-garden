### Strategies to Engage Learners
-  Participate in warmups (e.g. kamustahans, prayers): Can be interactive
- Summarize your learnings at the end of class: Constructive
- Discuss with groupmates/classmates: Interactive
- Write down notes from lecture: Active? (This can be upgraded by having them do Cornell notes)
	- Can be a formative assessment (e.g. What is the main takeaway from the lesson?)
- Answer discussion boards: Constructive? (Can be upgraded to Interactive by having them reply to their classmates’ answers also)
