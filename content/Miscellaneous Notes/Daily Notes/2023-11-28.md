## Aesthetics
### Individual Report
**Outline:**
1. Title Slide: "I designed a fictional church"
	1. Main idea
2. Context: campaign + location
3. Exterior: landscape
	1. Form
		1. Inspired by the IRL Cologne Cathedral, 2x larger
		2. Dominates the whole city...and also the sky, thanks to its spire
	2. Function
		1. Spires contribute to the building's height + aesthetic
	3. Content/Context
		1. The size of the church reflects its significance in the city
		2. Spires could also symbolize the heavenly aspirations of pious medieval men.
		3. Like a Tower of Babel situation...the ppl want to reach the heavens (where the angels are), but at the same time, they're also implying that "oh we can get to ur level, we too can occupy the skies"
4. Exterior: zoom in, sculpture
	1. Form
		1. Facade: shit ton of spires, star symbols everywhere
		2. Angelic sculpture: naturalistic, "artificial pretty"
	2. Function: decoration
	3. Content/Context
		1. Facade: more spires = more ambitions; stars represent the source of the angels' powers
		2. Angelic sculpture: could be interpreted as watching over/protecting the church... people wanted to feel the angels' presence 
5. Interior: ribbed vault
	1. Form: Ribbed vault ceiling with vivid fresco paintings that depict complex compositions
	3. Function
		1. Ribbed vaults + pointed arches are flexible and light. They provide structural support for the cathedral's aesthetic (e.g. massive height; stained glass windows)
		2. Frescos tell stories e.g. pictorial cycles. Like Giotto's stagelike settiings.
	4. Content/Context
		1. Ribbed vault
		2. Fresco: significant scenes, such as the angels in their origin stories and their overtaking of the city. 
		3. Time-consuming
6. Interior: Stained Glass windows
	1. Form: windows of the saints, with blackletter labelling
	2. Function: "lux nova" effect, transforming the church from an earthly one to a heavenly one. pilgrims pray before these windows
	3. Context: also labor-intensive and time-consuming.

**Takeaways:**
- Worldbuilding requires borrowing from real life...
- How central religion is to civilization....to the point that they dedicate most of their resources to it
