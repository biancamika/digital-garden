### Module 3: Origins, Life, and Species
#### Origins, Endings, and Evolution

- Speculative evolution is the science and/or art of looking at the long, rich, complex history of how life came to be as it is on our planet and saying, =="Okay, but what if...?" ==
	- We do this for a variety of reasons: because it's an interesting thought exercise, because we want to extrapolate from known patterns and take stock of how far life has come and imagine where it might yet go. Imagining the fantastic ways in which life on Earth could develop (or might have developed, in an alternate timeline) is something we do as scientists and as fictionists for any number of reasons, up to and including the fact that it's just plain fun.
- But why do we find this exercise so compelling?
	- One reason is, of course, the fact that the creatures of speculative evolution are cool. As many of you will no doubt agree, the power of cool creatures can never be underestimated. And it's even cooler when we bring actual research and scientific grounding into the exercise, because it allows us to see that the same principles which keep our world familiar to us can also be extrapolated to create things that are both unlike anything we've ever seen and at the same time utterly plausible.
	- Where this all gets much more loaded is the concept of **speculative _human_ evolution**: ==the exploration of the idea that there might be other kinds of people that we might become in the future or who may already be sharing the planet with us.== We ascribe a lot of value and weight to the term "human," a word that has both social and biological connotations, and so the idea that there might be other types of creatures that might lay claim to the term on a social/identity level despite not being "like us" biologically is an idea to which humanity has always had varied and intense reactions, to say the least.
![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20230209002243.png]]
- As we know from science fiction in general, our questions about the future are really questions about the present: =="What will happen next?" is really a question about what's happening now that we can't see==, and =="Who will we become?" is really a question about who we already are.==
	- We see this tendency in our creation stories from religion and mythology: if you believe that humanity was shaped by hand in the image and likeness of God, for example, that's a metaphorical statement about our nature, value, and place in the universe. 
	- Creationists thus might react violently to the idea that we are the product of random chance, because that can be read as an implicit denial of the idea behind the creationist credo: the belief that humanity is uniquely valued by a divine being who deliberately shaped us a certain way. 
	- ==The story we believe about how we came to be is also, implicitly, the story we tell ourselves about why we are the way we are.== And you can project this logic forwards as well as backwards: a story about where you think we're going is really a statement about where you think we are now, and about our response to that. If you believe we will become better people in the future, that's also a belief that in the present, we _can_.

#### Origin of Life on Planets
- In the previous Module, we discussed the diversity of life-forms on science fiction planets, with an emphasis on how evolution explains this biodiversity. Let's now look at how all of this life could begin on a planet in the first place. As I'm sure you've come to appreciate by now, evolution plays a very important role in that as well.
- Not a lot of sci-fi goes so far as to explain the origins of their home-world and the beginning of life on them. Perhaps not surprisingly, this is usually important only in sci-fi universes that are featured across several novels, with the books showcasing different planets and species. In this way, the origin of life in these universes serves as an explanation and common thread for the diversity in the books. 
	- In such sci-fi universes, ==the shared origin of species can be considered its own _novum_.== 
	- The two most apparent examples are Larry Niven's _Known Space Universe_ and Ursula Le Guin's _Hainish Cycle_. What they have in common is the idea of a ==hyper-advanced species intentionally seeding other planets.== We actually have a term for that in biology: **directed panspermia**. Why does biology have a term for a trope in science fiction? Well, that's because panspermia isn't completely sci-fi.
- Before we go into how _life_ can begin on a planet, let's first talk about what types of planets can have life in the first place. For that, we need to begin with what provides the energy for the sustenance of life on any world: the stars. **[Episode 7 - World-building 101: O M G! Star Classes and Life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxwQ9tYKIIU)**
	- So, not all stars are viable candidates for hosting planets that have life. You might want to keep this in mind when creating your own sci-fi world.

**Points for Discussion**
1. What types are of stars are most likely to host life on their satellite planets? Why?
2. Do you think sci-fi authors should be more deliberate in identifying the type of host star of their created worlds? Why or why not?

- So now you have your host star. For obvious reasons, a great majority of sci-fi takes place on rocky planets, but of course there's nothing stopping you from creating one that happens entirely on a gaseous planet! 
- However, the environmental conditions (i.e. gasses, rocks, minerals, water availability, pressure, gravity, temperature, etc.) on your planet would definitely matter in shaping the life that evolves on that planet, because those environmental conditions will serve as the **evolutionary pressures** that will determine the ==survivability== of the various life-forms. 
- But even before we talk about the evolution of life, we have to explore first how life could begin in the first place in a barren, lifeless world. Did life on a planet come from pre-existing life outside the planet (**panspermia**), or did it develop _in situ_ from non-living environmental components? Or is it some combination of the two? Watch this next video for an overview of the well-accepted ideas on how life could have began on our own planet: **[Episode 20 - World-Building 101: How Life Can Begin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAyvAiJooPo)**
- In many ways, panspermia is the most exciting among the three origin hypotheses given the extraterrestrial source and even the possibility of a hyper-intelligent alien species having a hand in our beginnings! 
	- So it shouldn't be surprising that Niven's and Le Guin's universes are built on that idea. 
	- Heck, even the anime mega-franchise _Neon Genesis Evangelion_ uses it to explain the origins of humans, Evangelions, and Angels! 
	- In the episode of _Star Trek: The Next Generation_ entitled "The Chase," which is one of our primary references for this Module, panspermia is also used as an explanation for the diversity of intelligent life in the _Star Trek_ universe.

**Points for Discussion**
1. Think of a _novum_ for one of the three origin hypotheses OR your own "origin of life" _novum_. 
2. How does "The Chase" use panspermia to support the bigger themes that the _Star Trek_ franchise has been exploring?

#### Genetics and Evolution
##### A Brief Review of Basic Genetics
![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20230209163611.png]]
- You've likely heard it said before: ==our genes determine who we are. ==
- **Genes** are found on chromosomes (those things in the nucleus that move around and are split apart during mitosis, which all of you know) and are made up of, among others, **DNA** (deoxyribonucleic acid), which structurally consists of a sugar (carbohydrate, one of the four organic compounds), a phosphate group, and four **nitrogenous bases**, namely adenine (A), cytostine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T). DNA contains the information on who we are as a species and as an individual, primarily depending on the sequence of those nitrogenous bases. 
- How does that actually work? The short of it is this:
	- In **replication**, the double-stranded, helical DNA molecule unwinds and each strand becomes independent of the other, thus leaving each strand to bind with another strand. But because of the unique pairing of bases (adenine with thymine and cytosine with guanine, as seen in the topmost figure), ==the resulting two DNA molecules are identical to the parent DNA molecule.== This DNA replication is what happens during S phase of interphase prior to mitosis and is the main way by which genetic material is copied from parent cell to daughter cell.
	- During a process called **transcription**, one strand of an unwound DNA molecule binds not with another strand of DNA but with a strand of **RNA** (ribonucleic acid), a different type of nucleic acid from DNA. Specifically, this RNA is called **messenger RNA** or **mRNA**. Like DNA, it consists of a sugar, a phosphate group, and four nitrogenous bases, but instead of thymine it has uracil (U). It's the unique pairing of adenine to uracil and of guanine to cytosine that allows the binding of two strands of nucleic acids. The mRNA molecule will detach from the DNA strand that it used as a template so that it can move to the next step.
	- During **translation**, the mRNA strand, being on its own and thus capable of binding with another nucleic acid strand, binds with another RNA molecule, but this time it's **transfer RNA** or **tRNA**. There are two very important things to note in this process: 
		1) tRNA binds to the mRNA template in clusters of three nitrogenous bases (e.g. AUG, GGU, CGA, etc.) called a **triplet codon** 
		2) each tRNA triplet codon brings with it an **amino acid** (like glutamic acid, serine, lysine, methionine, etc.), which is the building block of proteins. 
		3) So essentially, an mRNA template will produce a string of amino acids whose identity is determined by the specific triplet codon. For example, AUG always codes for methionine. This coding system, which we believe to be universal to all life (at least all carbon-based life!), is called the **genetic code**. When the amino acids are strung together and detach from the tRNA molecules that had carried them, we now have a **polypeptide** or more commonly referred to as a protein.
![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20230209163933.png]]

- What's the importance of producing proteins from the specific DNA base sequence? 
	- In many ways, ==our protein make-up determines who we are==, because proteins are extremely important structural components (i.e. they make up or muscles, hair, nails, cell membranes, skin, eyes, etc.), are used as enzymes (which catalyze chemical reactions, including those involved in transcription and translation), and even determine our behaviors, which are mediated by specific pairings between proteins and cell receptors! 
	- These processes involving DNA coding for our protein make-up is so central to our genetic identity and physical traits that collectively, they are referred to as ==the **Central Dogma** of molecular biology.==

##### Biological Evolution
-  One good definition of evolution is ==_gradual genetic change at the population level_.== Let's dissect that definition. 
	- Evolution is, first and foremost, ==change.== Organisms change over time; they are not static. Most of these changes are accounted for by **mutations**, which are ==random (i.e. unpredictable) changes in our genes== (such as in the sequence of our nitrogenous bases, and now you can appreciate what that would mean!). 
	- By gradual, we mean not necessarily that evolution takes a very long time (some evolutionary events have taken only decades!), but that it's usually ==an accumulation of small, incremental changes== instead of one big sudden mutation. 
		- For example, the evolution of amphibians from fish involved independent changes in the shape of the head, the development of the ribs, the position of the eyes, the shaping of the limb bones, etc. We say it's genetic change because only traits that can be passed from one generation to the next (i.e. heritable) can be subject to evolution. 
	- And lastly, individuals do not evolve. If you suddenly grow wings, sorry but you ain't evolving, my friend! Evolution works on the level of the **population**, which is ==a group of organisms of the same species living together in the same place and interbreeding.== We see this through changes in the frequencies of **alleles** in a population over time. 
		- Simply put, alleles are alternative forms of genes. For example, the gene for seed color can have the yellow allele and the green allele. If there has been a significant change in the proportions of alleles in a population (i.e. the number of individuals bearing the alleles) over time, then evolution is happening.
- Here's a very good example to illustrate that: there is a species of moth that's quite common in North American and European forests called the peppered moth (_Biston betularia_). There are commonly two forms: the white _B. betularia_ f. _typica_ bearing the allele for white coloration and the black _B. betularia_ f. _carbonaria_ bearing the allele for black coloration. 
	- Prior to the industrial revolution, when the air was much cleaner and the trees' trunks were covered in lichen and thus gave them a white color, the white form was much more common than the black, having allele frequencies of 0.80 (i.e. 80% of individuals have the allele and are thus white) or higher. 
	- This was because white moths that perched on the tree trunks blended with their surroundings, whereas the black moths stood out like a sore thumb. Guess what the birds ate? The frequency of the black allele was so low because most black moths were being eaten before they could mate, produce offspring, and pass on their alleles for black color to the next generation!
	- But when the industrial revolution created soot and ash that over centuries killed the lichen and coated the tree trunks, thus darkening them, the fates of the two forms were reversed: now it was the white ones that stood out and were being eaten by the predatory birds. This caused a drastic reversal in the allele frequencies, with the black moths becoming much more dominant. Thus, this is evolution at work on the population level. And bird predation was the major evolutionary pressure here (though human activity had its part in influencing the evolutionary trajectory of the species).
![[Extras/Media/Images/Pasted image 20230209164319.png]]

- That, my friends, is evolution in a nutshell, particularly Darwinian evolution (named after the man Charles Darwin, who introduced us to the concept of **variation**). 
- **Natural selection** is but one of several mechanisms for evolution but it's the most popular one. It's based on ==competition for resources and the consistent differences in the fitness of individuals in an environment==; some individuals are more fit than others, and thus they will outcompete others and survive. 
	- Biologically speaking, **fitness** is ==the ability of an organism to reproduce and pass on its genes to the next generation.== Traits that raise fitness are called **adaptations**. 
	- So in the _B. betularia_ example, the white form had higher fitness prior to the industrial revolution, then the black form had higher fitness after its onset; their colors were adaptations against bird predation. As you can imagine, the fitness of an individual or of a group of individuals will depend on what's happening to the environment at any given moment. ==So what's fit at one time will not necessarily be fit all the time, and the strongest and largest aren't always the fittest!== That's what makes the term "survival of the fittest" rather problematic.
- One very good way to understand more about what evolution is is to understand what it **is not**. Watch **[Episode 5 - How Pop Culture Usually Gets Science and Evolution Wrong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-T7rzM5pis)**

**Points for Discussion**
1. Relate panspermia to evolution in explaining the diversity of species coming from the same origin in sci-fi universes.
2. Relate the concept of fitness to the Evolutionary Arms Race.
3. Relate the concept of the niche to what you've just learned in evolution.
4. What does "The Chase" say about DNA and evolution that is not necessarily consistent with the widely accepted biological views?
5. What ideas have _you_ had about evolution that you now know are misconceptions?

## Discerning Life Questions
#DLQ10 
> **Articulating Your Life Question** + 300-word explanation

**"Why do I constantly feel anguish when it comes to dance?"**

Outline:
- dance is my main passion
- however, it is also a huge source of stress for me
- recount what happened in the past year

I consider dance as one of my core passions in life. Ever since I decided to pursue it seriously half a decade ago, it has been an integral part of my identity and lifestyle. My day isn't complete without going to a dance class, training with teammates, or simply exercising on my own. And so many of my most treasured relationships — friends and mentors — came from dance. However, it has also been a huge source of stress for me. Most of the traumatic experiences I've had are related to dance, such as the following: failing to make the competition team in high school three years in a row, and having to leave my old dance studio, which turned out to be a toxic environment. To be honest, I feel like I'm struggling as a member of CADs right now; in this past year, I got rejected from most of the org opportunities I applied for (e.g. deputy positions, competition team line-ups, involvement in core projects). This all leads me to enaging with various negative impulses: comparing myself to others, self-flagellation, resentment, etc. While I still want to keep dance in my life, I also wish to have a healthier relationship with it. I believe examining my feeling towards it would bring me towards this goal. This is why I want to make dance the focus of my Life Question.
