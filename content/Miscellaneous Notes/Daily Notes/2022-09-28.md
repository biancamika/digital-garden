### Culture Ingested
> How does the reading help you understand the ==intangible dimension of culture==?

- **The difference between Appropriation v.s. Indeginization lies in their worldviews**
	- Appropriation: We assume that culture can be owned
	- Indeginization: Culture is an exchange; it's a process; no assumption of absolute ownership
- Doreen changes the framing: **What is Filipino? -> How does something become Filipino?**
