#thesis
>Aside from looking for background information (e.g. sources documenting the introduction and development of technologies in the Philippines), I will also approach secondary research as horizon scanning; here, I will be seeking signals of change in sources that cover the impact of technologies in the Philippines (e.g. texts, podcasts, interviews, news, media, academic research). Only sources published in the last two decades will be studied.

## Research Nuggets
Based on https://medium.com/@WeWorkUX/the-atomic-unit-of-research-insight-17d619583ba#.1hevkuz9p

### Data to Track
- Title
- URL
- Date
- Type: (Article, Journal, Book, etc.)
- Sentiment?

### Coding
#### Research Subquestions
**investigate Filipinos’ future technological imaginaries and see how these shape their lives**
1. What perceptions do Filipino technologists have towards the future and technology?
2. What are their envisioned probable and preferred technological futures?
3. How did the surrounding culture of these technologists influence their own perceptions and visions?
4. How are these technologists’ lives shaped by these perceptions and visions?

#### Futures Triangle
1. Pull of the Future
	1. What drivers of change are pulling us towards particular futures?
	2. What are the compelling images of the future, those we can’t overlook?
	3. Are there competing images of the future?
2. Push of the Present
	1. What drivers of change are pushing us towards particular futures?
	2. What quantitative drivers of change are changing the future?
	3. What is happening now? What is popular now?
3. Weight of History
	1. What is holding us back or getting in our way?
	2. What are the barriers to change?
	3. What are the deep structures that resist change?

#### Notes
- For subquestion 1, track emotions/sentiments? or/and insights
- For subquestion 2, track experience vectors (positive, neutral, negative)? along with involved technologies?
- For subquestion 3, I think I would need to track local cultural factors (probably inductively)
- For subquestion 4....IDK
- I may have to add another table/view? just for sources related to PH culture...given the gap
	- Just use a filter
- I think I'll use **deductive coding** for industries/technologies (e.g. crypto, fintech)
- Then **inductive coding** for other general insights

##### Methodology
- https://sts-munich.de/student-voices/rawabi-sti/
	- Employing a case study approach, my analysis of the core sociotechnical imaginaries of RTH, how they are being articulated and performed were derived entirely from secondary research, and my data sources involved the gathering and analysis of news articles, official discourses and guidelines, public events, and surveys on the public perception of innovation processes to date. I also carried out a content analysis of official platforms related to RTH, such as the official websites and companies within the ecosystem
	- These published outputs provided accurate and precise details on the innovation initiative, such as the positioning of the actors involved in the development of the tech hub. They underscore the imaginaries by which their proponents envisaged the world and are, therefore, key tools in materialising their visions of desirable futures. This wide array of data sources enabled sufficient data triangulation to develop credible and compelling narratives and to achieve conceptual validity.
