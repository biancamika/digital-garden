## Notes
### Ethnographic
#### KS
##### Background
- Early 20s, graduated college...going through crisis where their friend group is getting smaller, and it's harder to meet new people
- thinks there'll be a rise in white collar jobs for Filipinos (compared to the usual blue collar jobs)
	- A kind of Renaissance; look, Filipinos have this kind of talent too
- Work experiences
	- Startups give their workers so much freedom, allow them to experiment with technologies. But they can also be exploitative in a sense that...they don't compensate the extra work
	- Meanwhile, corporate taught her how to play office politics.
		- AI models reflect us, reflect leadership, etc...
- Role of technology
	- *Algorithms To Live By:* a book about the computer science of human decisions...an exploration of how computer algorithms can be applied to our everyday lives
		- She sees our lives as ran by algorithms
		- Technology influences her by recommending the ways she should live her life, from what she should eat to who she should date
	- again, currently going through early 20s crisis where its becoming harder to meet people
		- relies on tech to initiate connections
	- Relies on Flo for menstruation tracking, as someone who struggles with PCOS
		- the datafied self, self-tracking
	- Relies on Messenger for communication because all of her connections are on that platform
		- Given for all Filipinos noh...this is hard to give up compared to our peers in other countries
		- Similar to the role of Whatsapp in China
- Technological advancements
	- Why she wants to build a chatbot at work...coworkers at her multinational keep messaging her very simple questions that could be solved by simply reading the documentation
		- We Filipinos...we in the Global south...are always adjusting for others! Always doing the extra emotional, social, etc. labor... E.G. waking up to their timezone
		- Perhaps this is why we're so attracted to AI? because it deals with this extra labor for us
	- Started to use ChatGPT, and it really boosted her productivity at work, by generating code templates for her.
	- Also using ChatGPT to help with starting small businesses. How it helps: saving money by doing creative tasks (e.g. writing content, creating visuals) for her
		- AI used to replace creative labor, something Filipinos are known for (craftsmen > directors)
		- She feels guilty about this...she said she would definitely invest in creative talent if the business scales but right now her budget doesn't allow for it. 
		- Thinks business and finance roles? aren't as replaceable
- Core values and principles; future impact
	- Simple: moral good. Makes sure no one is harmed.
		- BUT may allow harm if it's all for the greater good (like the Omelas problem)
	- Acknowledges that she doesn't see herself doing much societal impact in her (soap) company except improving the productivity of employees
		- Most company problems are caused by dinosaur technology and people with dinosaur minds...she believes it can be solved with proper embedding of technology
			- E.G. product managers not understanding technical solutions due to lack of knowledge
			- E.G. automating tedious, repetitive jobs like looking up records on Excel. bullshit jobs
			- Tech solutionism?
	- Sees herself going from engineer to architect kind of role
		- In the past, she thought her role would be replaced by AI. But she realized this would be difficult to do due to the need for governance
		- Off the record: Company got sued because of data privacy issues. Ever since then, they've had stricter procedures regarding data. So much documentation has to be followed.
			- AI can't replace this
##### Scenarios
###### Optimistic
- **Socialization:** they want something like Google Maps that lets them see what gatherings are happenings
	- Acknowledges that it could be quite creepy though. Privacy issues?
	- Again, rooted in loneliness? problem
- **Education**
	- Hybrid classes. What if you could learn about VR stuff in Japan?
		- General
	- Meta's [Education in the Metaverse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLOcj5qvOio)
	- Imagine if you could just talk to characterswithout bothering anyone else (unlike in Zoom, where there's more friction + higher chances of error)
	- VR/AR technology
- Shopping: 
	- same with education, use of vr/ar technology
	- what if we could try out what we buy by visualizing it?
	- talks about hassles of measuring furniture for her room
- Transportation:
	- Singapore's transport system is the best example
	- No need for fancy emerging tech here, like AI and VR (even the simplest improvements for infrasturcture would be optimistic)
	- Centralization of payment (Beep card can be used for all vehicles, even tricycles)
		- linked to finance
		- Inherently calls for the modernization of vehicles
		- makes wearable tech possible
- Entertainment: 
	- thinks an algorithmic feed like Tiktok is an optimistic future
	- sounds pretty dystopic to me tho ngl imagine all the data privacy implications
- Finance:
	- integration of wearable technology (like in transportation)
	- AI that tells you how to spend and save
	- no need to look for sketchy financial advisors
- Health and wellness:
	- Similar to finance, assistant that tells you what food to eat, what activities to do, and what you should do when you get sick
	- AI-enabled
	- Gamified tracking

###### Pessimistic
- **Socialization:** People always know where you are and what you're doing. Too much information of you out there
	- People can make up in their minds what kind of person you are
	- You can become an outcast for having "unacceptable" interests, or not having social media at all. 
	- Widened political divide
	- People cutting ties because of what the algorithms are feeding them ("I only see what I want to see") a
		- Can be a downside of her optimistic scenario...she acknowledges this
	- Dating is an unnatural process...people think really superficially
		- standards set by K-Pop idols or celebrities
- 

###### Probable

### Foresight
#### LB
##### Notes
- social networking and e-commerce were raw concepts back then, they couldn't really be executed without big corporations
- bitcoin is too valuable to spend on everyday necessities... as it gets more valuable, it becomes more painful to spend. But it's a great saving mechanism. it mimics gold
- When you open-source something, everything does it. This is what happens with democratization
- believes that crypto has the potential to fix some of the inequities of being a Filipino
	- The peso sucks; it's the reverse of Bitcoin, in the sense that you get punished for saving it over time
- Values
	- General advice: Make yourself useful to others
- Tech trends
	- AGI is an inevitability; software that is smarter than us
	- 5 years from now
		- AI will tend to obsolesce the jobs that are the most tedious (e.g. call center support). Reason: convergists of the world don't give a shit about Filipino jobs; they just care about providing value to stakeholders
			- call center sector is done for...5% of our GDP
		- World's population is declining. Every industrialized country has a negative growth rate.
			- Old people here need young people to take care of them...this is where Filipinos come in 
			- We were actually here during the 1980s, where the OFW trend started. Not enough local jobs made people go overseas

	- It gets murky after that, since AI will dictate where it'll go
		- Will we even see it before it happens?
		- Problem: AI is like the atomic bomb. if you get it wrong, you only have one chance to contain it. AI will be our last great invention
		- Worry: AI is driven by corporate desires of Microsoft
	- Crypto's relevance
		- Sam Altman also co-founded Worldcoin. They want to scan every person's eye.

			- ^ helps with UBI
		- Sam understands that OpenAI will cause mass unemployment. Hence this other startup.
		- If you get your eyeball scanned, you'll get a token. Africa..people don't care about their identity. but syndicates started to happen (cobra problem)
- Lifestyle changes
	- Problem with AI: eliminate the need for junior rank-and-file (especially in the creative industry)
		- But Filipinos are so known for their craft...
	- Midjourney has no real sense of what is appropriate; you have to tell it
	- it'll be hard to break into those industries because there'll be someone better (AI)
	- But you still need hands to do stuff
	- He wears smart glasses. We'll have more of this stuff over time...everyone will have an assistant
		- what if we forget how to drive because our cars do it for us?
	- Human condition is not defined by that kind of knowledge
	- Star Trek future: no money, there's resources for everyone
- Values, priorities, aspirations
	- nephew will grow up in a world where smartphones are a given, AI is a given
	- will we all become lazy? like the humans in Wall-E, where all they do is consume
	- Idiocracy: humans in developed countries stop having kids...those not as educated do the opposite...what if that's all that's left of humans? the idiots
	- what do you with the extra time you're gaining? hopefully good things
	- you don't get mass adoption if you still require tutorials
	- we're only aware of PHP and USD....20,000 currencies is a lot
	- He would like to see a universal wallet.

	- Blockchain and elections...you could make votes more transparent and untamperable?
	- Crypto removes some power from the state, and redistributes it to society. Removes the need to entrust institutions
		- Self-sovereignty 
	- Bitcoin is still a massive energy consumer
		- AI probably takes up a similar amount of resources
- Metaphors
	- Units of time become a form of currency
	- Passionate about crypto: devaluation doesn't just steal money, but also our time
	- there's a particular gene that makes us get old...what if you could turn off that gene? AI could help find the genome

		- https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/bryan-johnson-anti-aging-blueprint-algorithm-1234821163/
- History: the internet made it possible
	- before, you could only get news from radio, TV. so only corporations/institutions had control over information
	- Crypto...what if wealth could be redistributed in the same way information was?
	- The Internet is a borderless technology
	- technology was designed for all of the world to get access to it...but governance is not...
	- binance's ban in the Philippines
	- Another example: Starlink internet
	- conflict between techology's advancement and nation-state limits
