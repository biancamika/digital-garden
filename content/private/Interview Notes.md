## Notes
### Ethnographic
#### KS
##### Background
- Early 20s, graduated college...going through crisis where their friend group is getting smaller, and it's harder to meet new people
- thinks there'll be a rise in white collar jobs for Filipinos (compared to the usual blue collar jobs)
	- A kind of Renaissance; look, Filipinos have this kind of talent too
- Work experiences
	- Startups give their workers so much freedom, allow them to experiment with technologies. But they can also be exploitative in a sense that...they don't compensate the extra work
	- Meanwhile, corporate taught her how to play office politics.
		- AI models reflect us, reflect leadership, etc...
- Role of technology
	- *Algorithms To Live By:* a book about the computer science of human decisions...an exploration of how computer algorithms can be applied to our everyday lives
		- She sees our lives as ran by algorithms
		- Technology influences her by recommending the ways she should live her life, from what she should eat to who she should date
	- again, currently going through early 20s crisis where its becoming harder to meet people
		- relies on tech to initiate connections
	- Relies on Flo for menstruation tracking, as someone who struggles with PCOS
		- the datafied self, self-tracking
	- Relies on Messenger for communication because all of her connections are on that platform
		- Given for all Filipinos noh...this is hard to give up compared to our peers in other countries
		- Similar to the role of Whatsapp in China
- Technological advancements
	- Why she wants to build a chatbot at work...coworkers at her multinational keep messaging her very simple questions that could be solved by simply reading the documentation
		- We Filipinos...we in the Global south...are always adjusting for others! Always doing the extra emotional, social, etc. labor... E.G. waking up to their timezone
		- Perhaps this is why we're so attracted to AI? because it deals with this extra labor for us
	- Started to use ChatGPT, and it really boosted her productivity at work, by generating code templates for her.
	- Also using ChatGPT to help with starting small businesses. How it helps: saving money by doing creative tasks (e.g. writing content, creating visuals) for her
		- AI used to replace creative labor, something Filipinos are known for (craftsmen > directors)
		- She feels guilty about this...she said she would definitely invest in creative talent if the business scales but right now her budget doesn't allow for it. 
		- Thinks business and finance roles? aren't as replaceable
- Core values and principles; future impact
	- Simple: moral good. Makes sure no one is harmed.
		- BUT may allow harm if it's all for the greater good (like the Omelas problem)
	- Acknowledges that she doesn't see herself doing much societal impact in her (soap) company except improving the productivity of employees
		- Most company problems are caused by dinosaur technology and people with dinosaur minds...she believes it can be solved with proper embedding of technology
			- E.G. product managers not understanding technical solutions due to lack of knowledge
			- E.G. automating tedious, repetitive jobs like looking up records on Excel. bullshit jobs
			- Tech solutionism?
	- Sees herself going from engineer to architect kind of role
		- In the past, she thought her role would be replaced by AI. But she realized this would be difficult to do due to the need for governance
		- Off the record: Company got sued because of data privacy issues. Ever since then, they've had stricter procedures regarding data. So much documentation has to be followed.
			- AI can't replace this
##### Scenarios
###### Optimistic
- **Socialization:** they want something like Google Maps that lets them see what gatherings are happenings
	- Acknowledges that it could be quite creepy though. Privacy issues?
	- Again, rooted in loneliness? problem
- **Education**
	- Hybrid classes. What if you could learn about VR stuff in Japan?
		- General
	- Meta's [Education in the Metaverse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLOcj5qvOio)
	- Imagine if you could just talk to characterswithout bothering anyone else (unlike in Zoom, where there's more friction + higher chances of error)
	- VR/AR technology
- Shopping: 
	- same with education, use of vr/ar technology
	- what if we could try out what we buy by visualizing it?
	- talks about hassles of measuring furniture for her room
- Transportation:
	- Singapore's transport system is the best example
	- No need for fancy emerging tech here, like AI and VR (even the simplest improvements for infrasturcture would be optimistic)
	- Centralization of payment (Beep card can be used for all vehicles, even tricycles)
		- linked to finance
		- Inherently calls for the modernization of vehicles
		- makes wearable tech possible
- Entertainment: 
	- thinks an algorithmic feed like Tiktok is an optimistic future
	- sounds pretty dystopic to me tho ngl imagine all the data privacy implications
- Finance:
	- integration of wearable technology (like in transportation)
	- AI that tells you how to spend and save
	- no need to look for sketchy financial advisors
- Health and wellness:
	- Similar to finance, assistant that tells you what food to eat, what activities to do, and what you should do when you get sick
	- AI-enabled
	- Gamified tracking

###### Pessimistic
- **Socialization:** People always know where you are and what you're doing. Too much information of you out there
	- People can make up in their minds what kind of person you are
	- You can become an outcast for having "unacceptable" interests, or not having social media at all. 
	- Widened political divide
	- People cutting ties because of what the algorithms are feeding them ("I only see what I want to see") a
		- Can be a downside of her optimistic scenario...she acknowledges this
	- Dating is an unnatural process...people think really superficially
		- standards set by K-Pop idols or celebrities
- **Entertainment** (kind of related to socialization)
	- Tiktok algorithm 
-

	- Climate change implications
	- Lifestyle/behavior
		- Context: pandemic -> massive adoption of technologies

		- Look at how barangays converse...very community-based
		- internet cafes as the center of hangouts
		- tiktoks and mobas as bonding activities...Filipinos finding ways to pass the time despite intense hardships
- Context
	- Economy is built around service sector (largely fuelled by BPO)
		- Because of AI...there may be no need for this industry...or this sector may integrate AI. Loss of jobs + new jobs
		- things are getting more expensive
	- Ecological
		- AI acquires massive computing power....massive energy output. data centers, computer chips, etc.
		- will further intensify climate change, which PH is at the forefront of
		- more rapid dipilidation of our ecosystems due to the pressing need for technological advancement
	- Socio-cultural + Political
		- Filipino family; Filipino community
		- Social media influencing people at such a fast scale
		- What will develop in the next few decades: the pace? at which information is disseminated
			- E..G. phone calling years ago v.s. text messaging now
		- makes it easier for bad actors to disseminate misinformation
		- habits of content consumption (from radio to internet)
		- AI will probably further blur boundaries...make it easier to track?
		- Cambridge Analytica

		- National ID system
		- SIM card registration
	- Digital money

	- US empire, colonization....values of dispossesion
- I just need to ask about:
	- Interpretation
	- Historicization
#### LB
##### Notes
- social networking and e-commerce were raw concepts back then, they couldn't really be executed without big corporations
- bitcoin is too valuable to spend on everyday necessities... as it gets more valuable, it becomes more painful to spend. But it's a great saving mechanism. it mimics gold
- When you open-source something, everything does it. This is what happens with democratization
- believes that crypto has the potential to fix some of the inequities of being a Filipino
	- The peso sucks; it's the reverse of Bitcoin, in the sense that you get punished for saving it over time
- Values
	- General advice: Make yourself useful to others
- Tech trends
	- AGI is an inevitability; software that is smarter than us
	- 5 years from now
		- AI will tend to obsolesce the jobs that are the most tedious (e.g. call center support). Reason: convergists of the world don't give a shit about Filipino jobs; they just care about providing value to stakeholders
			- call center sector is done for...5% of our GDP
		- World's population is declining. Every industrialized country has a negative growth rate.
			- Old people here need young people to take care of them...this is where Filipinos come in 
			- We were actually here during the 1980s, where the OFW trend started. Not enough local jobs made people go overseas
			- Others will become freelancers
	- It gets murky after that, since AI will dictate where it'll go
		- Will we even see it before it happens?
		- Problem: AI is like the atomic bomb. if you get it wrong, you only have one chance to contain it. AI will be our last great invention
		- Worry: AI is driven by corporate desires of Microsoft
	- Crypto's relevance
		- Sam Altman also co-founded Worldcoin. They want to scan every person's eye. 
			- Maganimous purpose: they want to make sure that you can be represented as a real human being, as a unique identity, in the internet. It's hard rn given all the scams
			- ^ helps with UBI
		- Sam understands that OpenAI will cause mass unemployment. Hence this other startup.
		- If you get your eyeball scanned, you'll get a token. Africa..people don't care about their identity. but syndicates started to happen (cobra problem)
- Lifestyle changes
	- Problem with AI: eliminate the need for junior rank-and-file (especially in the creative industry)
		- But Filipinos are so known for their craft...
	- Midjourney has no real sense of what is appropriate; you have to tell it
	- it'll be hard to break into those industries because there'll be someone better (AI)
	- But you still need hands to do stuff
	- He wears smart glasses. We'll have more of this stuff over time...everyone will have an assistant

- Values, priorities, aspirations
	- nephew will grow up in a world where smartphones are a given, AI is a given
	- will we all become lazy? like the humans in Wall-E, where all they do is consume
	- Idiocracy: humans in developed countries stop having kids...those not as educated do the opposite...what if that's all that's left of humans? the idiots
	- what do you with the extra time you're gaining? hopefully good things
	- you don't get mass adoption if you still require tutorials
	- we're only aware of PHP and USD....20,000 currencies is a lot
	- He would like to see a universal wallet.
- Politics and ecology
	- Blockchain and elections...you could make votes more transparent and untamperable?
	- Crypto removes some power from the state, and redistributes it to society. Removes the need to entrust institutions
		- Self-sovereignty 
	- Bitcoin is still a massive energy consumer
		- AI probably takes up a similar amount of resources
- Metaphors
	- Units of time become a form of currency
	- Passionate about crypto: devaluation doesn't just steal money, but also our time
	- there's a particular gene that makes us get old...what if you could turn off that gene? AI could help find the genome
	- Brian Johnson: millionare on youtube makes videos about stopping aging
		- https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/bryan-johnson-anti-aging-blueprint-algorithm-1234821163/
- History: the internet made it possible
	- before, you could only get news from radio, TV. so only corporations/institutions had control over information
	- Crypto...what if wealth could be redistributed in the same way information was?
	- The Internet is a borderless technology
	- technology was designed for all of the world to get access to it...but governance is not...
	- binance's ban in the Philippines
	- Another example: Starlink internet
	- conflict between techology's advancement and nation-state limits
#### JD
- a matter of representation of people in color in the design field
- every designer feels like they're creating something good and impactful

		- because of stupid laws, poor governance...
		- compared to Singapore and Australia as good examples. they use that digital identity and it's so smooth
		- it's a bit creepy, but it makes accessing basic services so much easier
		- horror example: China, social scores
			- lack of trust in governance
		- he sees it as a plus for attracting expats, foreign talent...growing the tech market...it's definitely a must
		- really depends on who is in charge
	- finance, digital banking system
		- feels like it won't improve....due to distrust in financial institutions 
	- it would just be nice to see PH not just rely on normal electricity....lean into solar energy, green energy type of technology
		- PH has so much natural resources
		- infrastructure of power lines in the Philippines is such as mess
	- TL;DR: digital identity, green energy, and digital banking
		- interesting answers...i was expecting AI LOL
- behavior/lifestyle changes
	- you'll see privilege...some socioeconomic split with the digital identity
		- rich people (from BGC/Makati lol) will be incentivized (e.g. book flights easier)

	- same thing for green energy
		- may be attached to expensive hotels that can afford it, benefits rich people that stay there
		- you have to pay a premium for hydroelectricity
		- that's capitalism lol
	- digital banking
		- depends on the type of people willing to transfer, solely based on education
		- how do you make it easy to save? what is it like to transfer money?
		- digital banking in Australia is nice. Problem is you need a digital identity. you need to verify yourself
		- it's really hard to build trust
			- when you build trust your customers, you have to ensure safety and security (especially when it comes to money)
		- educational status is another thing. those with more education are more likely to sign up. tech literacy v.s. tech illiteracy
			- language barriers (e.g. everything is in English)
- values/aspirations/priorities
	- Fil-Am: rumours will spread like wildfire among titas of manila
	- gen alphas will be skeptical of course....
	- all about hearsay...that's how Filipino culture works. people hear from TVs, messenger, whatsapp. People rely on word of trust from family

	- people would brag about it....
		- my digital identity made it easy for me to do this, to do that....weird stories like that
		- my house is powered by the ocean lol
- cultural practices
	- what if the PH implemented a social score?
		- we're super Catholic/Christian...that may impact someone's status in the church....
		- it could be like PsychoPass...your score is affected by your moral misdeeds.
		- This could affect the community the person is involved in. Shows how technology could affect church, politics, etc.
	- pros: ensures history isn't erased (see last elections). cons: could be hacked, someone could be exposed
	- Tribalism would definitely happen
	- same with electricity. community using green electricity v.s. regular electricity. people with disaster lose access to power. latter will be inclined to steal from former?
- systems
	- economic
		- electricity: good long-term!
		- digital identity: depends on how you use it...socioeconomic split may occur...class warfare
		- banking: not sure
	- political
		- digital identity: definitely would have impact. if people have your identity, they could use it against you. community will judge you based on your history.
		- electricity: green energy companies v.s. standard energy companies
			- US still wants to do coal
		- banking: PH government having issues with an upstart tech company
	- socio-cultural
		- digital identity and digital banking: cultural clash between if its good or not.

	- ecological
		- electricity: of course going green is good
		- digital banks: maybe it saves you the trip of going to actual banks
		- digital identity: saves a lot of paperwork, everything becomes digitized
- interpretations
	- digital identity: 
		- mystery sickness (like COVID)? "Does so and so have it?".
		- having an identity is like being vaccinated...if you're not protected
		- anti-vaxxers: "i'm never giving my information to the government!"; isolate themselves from ease of access to other services
	- green energy:
		- education. people are scared of what they don't know about. similar to a vaccine/sickness....
		- new technology replacing what we're used to (e.g. regular electricity)
		- machines showing up in the water...so weird...is that good or bad?
		- changes the landscape. changes my land. changes what i'm used to.
	- digital banking:
		- also about trust. can i trust this? i'm skeptical. this is new.
		- my teenage son uses it to save money,  but i've never heard
- history
	- a lot of entrepreneurs tried to do startups...but lack of digital identity blocked them
	- governance prevented them (e.g. you need to be a citizen)
	- electricity, weather patterns: PH keeps getting hit by cyclones all the time. and people always lose electricity because power sources keep getting knocked out. how do you build infrastructure for this?
	- digital banks. the Philippines is easily swayed by trendy apps...transferring money from somewhere to somewhere....
	- Follow-up
		- ask: is this kind of resistance of foreign talent good? or bad?
			- depends on the foreign talent
			- it's so hard to get jobs in the country
			- Singapore is the same way
			- bribing is a thing. there needs to be measures in place
			- there's so much opportunity in the PH to make good decisions. he just wishes it was easier to make such decisions
		- ask about his experiences in previous developed countries...how did they introduce such innovations

				- wi
		- why is remittance so important to Filipinos?
			- a lot of migrant workers

## Ideas
### General
- i guess i can put all the hypothetical technology ideas in the research report
	- Does it have to be in PDF? what if i make a website version? I'm not good at print lol. Just format it after WeTransfer trends reports, or Kontinentalist 
- Just use summary notes for categorizing themes like socialization. don't highlight the full line.
- Sir. Martin asked for me to look at similar short stories/films so that we could extrapolate their narrative structures
### Narratives
- Kids study in the metaverse because real life is destroyed? They learn about what their country used to be like online...
	- Of course this is very prone to propaganda, to misinformation
	- Information comes from LLMs, visuals come from VR/AR?
	- Related interviews: Kirsten's pessimistic future, Jianna
- Lakwatsera/lakwatsero: show how terrible our transport infrastructure is, for both users and drivers
- Mukhang pera: financial transactions, world coin type of shit
