Hi Jasmine,  
  
Congratulations on launching Trellis! Its mission resonates greatly with me, and I would love to contribute to it somehow. I have a unique set of experiences that I believe would help me bring Trellis to life:  

üß†¬†**Interaction design** is my jam, and the products that I love working on the most are those that help with **processing and creating knowledge.** Some of the speculative interfaces I've made in the past were a [Strava for personal growth](https://www.figma.com/proto/xkAW1JCzlzrPuUC16Gg244/Scenius-(Interhackt)?page-id=1%3A3&node-id=168-37&viewport=-322%2C-1167%2C0.39&scaling=scale-down&starting-point-node-id=168%3A1&show-proto-sidebar=1) and [an exploration of mnemonic media](https://www.figma.com/proto/aetT114W4LJvpFkWNRF3qA/Mnemonic-Media?page-id=0%3A1&node-id=78-789&viewport=244%2C-105%2C0.07&scaling=scale-down&starting-point-node-id=78%3A810). One of the projects I'm most proud of is [The Lexicon](https://www.figma.com/proto/IfVVOXdbqmWhkeVXQB4fjm/The-Lexicon-Design?page-id=213%3A14&node-id=277-786&viewport=464%2C412%2C0.03&scaling=min-zoom&starting-point-node-id=277%3A786&show-proto-sidebar=1), a Web3-centric digital garden I designed for the Crypto, Culture, & Society DAO. Recently, I helped Story Jam, a generative AI sandbox for kids, develop experiences that guide children in [creating and interacting with their own characters](https://www.loom.com/share/0f66a9136b384e3bab98fa2431d3edd3) (and doing [rap battles](https://www.loom.com/share/c586e2a67b1d422c83cb58d9affcc63c) with them too).  

üë©‚Äçüè´¬†**Education is my vocation**, and I'm always thinking about how to create **better learning experiences.** In the past, I've spearheaded [workshops](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnYngUxN8QgYwwEyp_W6xhXOtUPhujqJC) and [an intensive curriculum](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnYngUxN8QgZ9NiuVMg0K2aQQdzBlCR6g) for my university's UX design organization, helping   hundreds of people learn about design practices and tools. I've also assisted with operations at [UX+ University](https://university.uxpl.us/), a 16-week bootcamp that is part of the largest UX education platform in Asia; I helped oversee student iniatives (e.g. customizable name cards and educational career content) and streamline the process for sending partnership e-mails. Finally, I advocate for better education through my writing, involving both criticism (e.g. [dissecting the exploitative nature of edtech programs](https://www.kernelmag.io/pieces/fast-food-education)) and imagination (e.g. [visualizing how Web3 can empower student agency](https://voice.mirror.xyz/jb6ziF4xdVEzfAlyoeZhDI2Lo0Oy-l7I-ac9vVvAhMw)). 

One design idea I have for Trellis is to maximize its potential to turn any book into a mnemonic medium, as exemplified by Andy Matuschak's [Orbit](https://withorbit.com/). Engaging with memory ensures that the student not only understands the textbook, but also *retains* this understanding. How would this work? Everytime a student finishes a chapter in a book, they have to go through a review that is based on their previous highlights (e.g. if they asked Trellis to simplify the definition of the Chief Good, it would later ask them to explain the Chief Good in their own words).
  
To be honest, I'm probably not the most qualified person for this job. I'm still in school, and I live all the way on the other side of the world. But I'm truly passionate about improving education with emerging technology, so I couldn't help reaching out. I just wanted to let you know that I'd love to help out in any way that I can.
