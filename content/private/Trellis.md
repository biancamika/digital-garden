- UXR
	- Airtable comparing competitors prices
- Operations
	- Self-updating dashboard on Socratic Tutors Google Docs
	- Create a shared calendar for interviews (perhaps through Zapier?)
		- I can add all events to [trellis.uxr@gmail.com](mailto:trellis.uxr@gmail.com), but we will need to manually add that cal to our calendars since it is not in the trellis work domain

### Outreach Captions
Personal facebook:
Are you struggling with school right now, and ChatGPT isn't being helpful at all? 😵

Some people I know are building an endlessly creative, always-on virtual tutor 🤖, and they're currently looking for students to test their beta (ideally those taking STEM classes like data structures and algorithms, organic chemistry, statistics, etc.). If you want to have a better time studying, sign up for the beta at bit.ly/test-trellis ✨


- reach out to Kyle in messenger, ask who i can reach out to

### Book Embedding Questions

### Weekly Ops Sync
- Another task for community team is to make these lists and relationships:  (another airtable)
	- great tutors to interview
	- subject matter experts to help us build our socratic tutor
#### OpenAI for Startups
How are you currently leveraging OpenAI? If you aren't, how do you plan on using OpenAI’s platform?
Trellis currently leverages ChatGPT to make textbooks more understandable (e.g. providing different grade level interpretations for passages, explaining images and formulas). Readers are also able to input their own prompts for selected texts. In the future, we are planning to launch a Socratic Tutor: an AI chatbot that assists students in learning how to complete problem sets in their textbooks.

- How can OpenAI for Startups help you?
Getting at least $10K in credits would be really helpful, since credits are our biggest expense (aside from labor).

#### Socratic Tutor Ops
- insights/takeaways, doc for refernce linked in the main message, thread for discussion
- insights - contextualized information/interview data
- Vishruth 
	- will use, not pay. He doesn't pay on principle for anything edtech
	- It will be his #2 most used app of ANYTHING
		- 1st used app: to-do lsit
	- Chegg is a supplement when your prof doesn't give you the solution
- TWO ON EACH CALL
- We need to analyze payment behavior
	- Would it be monthly subscription basis?
	- Or would they only pay before a big exam?
- We need to make a survey
- Figure out primary use case for tutor
- We need to start profiling better the kind of user we are targeting
	- "What kind of student are you?"
	- We need to develop some user personas
- Document is basically summary of the airtable insights
	- We did 13 interviews. 5 of them will pay. 12 of them will use.
	- Of the 13-5 who won't pay, here are the common reasons:
	- of the 12 who will use, here are the contexts in which they want to use
	- emerging student personas: High Spend / good Grades/ low income

### Demand Curve
#### Revenue and Pricing Models
- I think Trellis should start out with a flat-fee monthly membership first
	- Start with free trial
- Then maybe we can try usage-based pricing (e.g. number of books studied)
- Examples:
	- [OpenAI](https://openai.com/pricing)
		- Usage-based, but not understandable for the layman
	- [Audible](https://www.audible.com/ep/memberbenefits)
		- Flat-fee monthly or annual membership subscriptions that comes with set # of credits
		- Plans

##### Margaret Leona Possidente
- Background
	- https://www.linkedin.com/in/maggie-possidente/
	- Minerva student, majoring in Economics
	- From Maryland, USA
	- Classes she's struggling with the most
		- Insufficient background in Economics; lacks previous experience (even if she enjoys it)
		- Computer Science was her downfall
	- How she prepares for these
		- Youtube videos
			- Was hard to go in without any direction; doesn't know what exactly she should learn or where she should look 
		- Peer tutors 
	- Tools/techniques she uses
		- Readings are so dense
		- Does classwork the day before, then brushes up on this work the day itself.
		- Also does spaced repetition before the class if she knows she'll struggle a bit
		- Sectioned notes
			- 1 section for her braindump? 
			- 1 section for structuring her notes...for synthesizing everything in her brain
			- 1 section for class takeaways
		- Also goes out of her time to read physical books in the library, and learn from other established figures in the field
			- Preferred method
			- also reads e-books if needed EBSCO Books
		- While Youtube videos are great...she doesn't know where the resources are (especially for economics; not so much a problem for computer science)
	- Tutor
		- Had a tutor in high school for mathematics
			- had an okay experience
			- was  a bit awkward because of the age difference; felt like a professor
				- maybe we weren't such a good fit? (Shopping for tutors is a process)
			- would probably not have a tutor again
				- would prefer going straight to the teachers
				- was useful in the short-term...but
				- would probably not be helpful in the long-term, because she can't remember much
			- was homeschooled for most of her life, so used to hands-on learning
				- with a tutor she felt like she did less hands-on learning
		- Ideal tutor experience
			- Having a textbook wasn't always catered to her struggles...it was a general overview of the topic

				- She didn't need a second professor
			- She wants to be shown the way, not just given the steps from day one
	- GPA
		- Current: 3.6
		- Target: 3.7/3.8
			- Doesn't have a reason for this though, since most of the internships she's applying for doesn't ask for GPA
			- She wants to push herself to improve
	- Biggest problem in her education
		- Everyone struggles with time management but...
		- switching from home school to the institutional model was hard for her
		- she wants to feel secure and okay...instead of just struggling
		- Hard to find school-life balance, especially since she changes cities all the time
		- So much desires, so little time
		- Has to ensure she's studying efficiently so that she's making the most of her time

- Final verdict
	- Would definitely use this if it was a free tool
	- If it was a paid tool...
		- Has never use paid tools before
		- Wants to know and be sure of its value, especially to Minervan students
		- Range: $3-7 a month
			- $10 a month would be a bit too hard on a student budget
			- ^ is there a way to get institutional plans?
	- Finds edtech industry
		- Especially as a homeschool student slowly learning to gain control of her education
		- Her 14yr old homeschooled sister (freshman) is using all these tools

##### Sana Mehta
- Background
	- Studying Computer Science and Business at Minerva
	- Did not have any background with CS before Minerva
	- People are struggling as well, they're just not vocal about it
	- How she survived
		- Abdul Bari is a life-saver to her
		- This one book for Data Structures and Algorithms was so big...all the naswers were there but it wasn't her way of leanring...so she would resort to Youtube
		- Would also ask peers
		- StackOverflow
		- Going through other people's projects on Github
	- Biggest problem
		- Not having a proper source (took time to sift/filter for the best resources)
		- "What do I do now? I don't know where to go"
		- Figuring out her schedule for studying also took a lot of time...she had to learn a lot about herself as a person
	- GPA
		- Ideal GPA: above 3.5
		- Current GPA: 3.7 last semester (but not this semester)
	- Tutoring experience
		- studied Math and Accountancy
		- 1:1, small groups
- Feedback
	- Initial thoughts
		- First question: If I'm struggling with this certain concept...do I put in my question? And does it lead me to another resource?
		- Sees this as an alternative to a search engine...someone that could make searching for the right answer a more efficient process
		- Concern: How will you check the resource's credibility?
	- Would this be helpful in one of your classes? And if so, which?
		- Could be useful in both computer science and business classes
		- Those that utilize first principles
	- Other ideal features
		- Having an embedded video

		- Would be willing to pay 10-20 usd 
		- She recently bought Notion AI! (similar price range)
	- Other tools she's used
		- ChatGPT (not the most useful for coding though)
			- She wants to learn, not just get the answers
	- Is interested in further user testing, and become an ambassador also
		- Especially interested since she's been getting invovled with the edtech industry lately


##### Rain Wang
- https://www.linkedin.com/in/rain-kimberly-wang-18151b210/
- Background
	- Physics major at Harvard
	- 8/10 hours a week studying PSETs
	- strategy: goes straight to office hours
	- hardest moment in undergrad: 
		- taking 5 classes
		- Intro to Probability class
		- ^ taking this alongside other PSAT classes
		- feels she lacks strong foundation in statistics
		- started falling behind, eventually withdrew pset classses
		- even though it wasn't required, she was influenced by friends, assumed it was a right time to take it
	- You can do the bare minimum, but most Physics majors will never do that; it's self-motivated...people take classes out of their own self-interest
	- Didn't have a deep background in STEM (e.g. her school was IB, and only had SL Physics, not HL), but worked her way towards it
- Feedback on prototype
	- Find its helpful for developing conceptual understanding; a better intuition for Physics
		- Whenever I look things up, it gives me an answer without giving me a foundational answer for why it's true
		- It would've been helpful for her high school experience; she wasn't really engaging with her teacher (during online school), and would often look the answers up
			- As a result, she feels like she doesn't have a strong foundation compared to her peers
			- She made up for the gap with a forgiving grading system, along with a helpful TA
	- Exciting feature: chatbox 
		- "Is this chatbot connected to an online textbook, or can it access whatever I want?"
		- As a high schooler, I wouldn't pay attention to the textbook...I would pay attention to the HIGHLIGHTED resource. If it told me "Go to Chapter 2" it wouldn't do it
	- Curious about how the tutor would lead the student in the right direction
		- Sometimes high school students don't ask questions because they DON'T KNOW what to ask about
		- It's very easy to ask stupid questions, especially in a classroom setting
	- Thinks this would also be useful for English (also struggled with this a lot) in high school
		- How would it work if the class is largely based on readings?
		- Coming from a lower-end middle school, she had more lacking foundations
		- Made up for this gap by asking the teacher what exercises she could do, then work on that
	- On using this AI tutor
		- sure that she would use 10-15 minutes to consult the tutor
		- but majority of her time would be focused on solving psets
		- if she was desparate, she would consult the internet
		- Better to use in her free time, when she's studying for an exam
- Biggest priorities when it comes to her education
	- She wishes she had more time to understand the material
	- A lot of times when she would pull the answer from her friends; feels she can't set aside time to process the problem and her gap in understanding
	- Why she cares about understanding: it's an intrinsic motivation, similar to a lot of her peers. 
		- Even though she knows a lot of them will not be pursuing Physics-related careers (e.g. instead of research, it's data science)
		- Sees it as preparation for the types of critical thinking she needs in her future
	- Personal schedule does not overlap with office hours
		- Would prioritize certain extracurriculars or other classes more (especially those that require attendance)
		- Sometimes STEM professors are not good at teaching
- What resources she uses for solving PSETS
	- The Internet 
		- Can I find this question online?
	- ChatGPT 
		- May be wrong often, but she uses it to guide her in the right direction, so that she can use the whole thing
		- Use case: One of her lecturers was all over the place, so she was using ChatGPT to look up a bunch of terms (would rather do this instead of skimming the textbooks)
	- Has not paid for any technological aids (or textbooks)
	- Other resources:
		- Youtube
		- KhanAcademy 
- Interested in edtech + being an ambasssador!


- Process of working through PSETS
	- e.g. rubber duck strategy


##### Calum David Richards
- i should test this with my professors
- does the translation stay??
- students have trouble with context library stuff
	- 3rd grade (gives examples) helps with this
- "this is fascinating"
- he loves how 3rd grade feels conversational, helps with teachings, gives simple questions to make them participate in inquiry
- has to rip textbooks form physical/kindle, then turn into word document...school doesn't hae enough funding for physical textbooks
- there's a push towards current pedagogical techniques, push away from kids having to learn to read textbooks, makes teachers adapt
- 3rd grade turns formulas into conversational word explanations
- Do teachers think in terms of knowledge/concept trees?
- procedural knowledge v.s. conceptual knowledge
	- procedural: 
		- looking at a formula and unerstanding that x is not multiplication, it's an input
		- ^ this is a huge thing that trips up students who don't have experience
		- he would explain part by part (e.g. P = probability; have to make clear what KIND of operation is happening
- wants to compare contexts
