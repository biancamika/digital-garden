- **Calum David Richards**
	- i should test this with my professors
	- does the translation stay??
	- students have trouble with context library stuff
		- 3rd grade (gives examples) helps with this
	- "this is fascinating"
	- he loves how 3rd grade feels conversational, helps with teachings, gives simple questions to make them participate in inquiry
	- has to rip textbooks form physical/kindle, then turn into word document...school doesn't hae enough funding for physical textbooks
	- there's a push towards current pedagogical techniques, push away from kids having to learn to read textbooks, makes teachers adapt
	- 3rd grade turns formulas into conversational word explanations
	- Do teachers think in terms of knowledge/concept trees?
	- procedural knowledge v.s. conceptual knowledge
		- procedural: 
			- looking at a formula and unerstanding that x is not multiplication, it's an input
			- ^ this is a huge thing that trips up students who don't have experience
			- he would explain part by part (e.g. P = probability; have to make clear what KIND of operation is happening
	- wants to compare contexts
	- more intuitive if the options were on the side, makes clearer the paragraph that is being selected atm
	- would use it, not sure if he would pay
		- if he would teach himself a subject without grad school
		- would pay less than the cost of a credit at grad school, but would pay decent amount of moneuy
	- What should be free? What should be paid for?
		- big problem: students who want to learn cannot do it and do not know how to help themselves
			- they often refer to youtube...we want to integrate with youtube
