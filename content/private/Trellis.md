#### Interview Notes
- 9/10 ease of use
- Problems: none
- would pay
##### Calum David Richards
- i should test this with my professors
- does the translation stay??
- students have trouble with context library stuff
	- 3rd grade (gives examples) helps with this
- "this is fascinating"
- he loves how 3rd grade feels conversational, helps with teachings, gives simple questions to make them participate in inquiry
- has to rip textbooks form physical/kindle, then turn into word document...school doesn't hae enough funding for physical textbooks
- there's a push towards current pedagogical techniques, push away from kids having to learn to read textbooks, makes teachers adapt
- 3rd grade turns formulas into conversational word explanations
- Do teachers think in terms of knowledge/concept trees?
- procedural knowledge v.s. conceptual knowledge
	- procedural: 
		- looking at a formula and unerstanding that x is not multiplication, it's an input
		- ^ this is a huge thing that trips up students who don't have experience
		- he would explain part by part (e.g. P = probability; have to make clear what KIND of operation is happening
- wants to compare contexts
- more intuitive if the options were on the side, makes clearer the paragraph that is being selected atm
- would use it, not sure if he would pay
	- if he would teach himself a subject without grad school
	- would pay less than the cost of a credit at grad school, but would pay decent amount of moneuy
- What should be free? What should be paid for?
	- big problem: students who want to learn cannot do it and do not know how to help themselves
		- they often refer to youtube...we want to integrate with youtube

##### Mathurah
- Doesn't understand the standard deviations/grade levels
- Wants to give feedback
	- text box/reactions
- Design sketches: Plug with WolframAlpha
- Generative visuals is a priority
- would pay if it had generative visuals + speed + UX

##### Sophia
- Day in the life
	- Assignments
	- reads through lectures
	- do problem sets
- Feedback
	- why is 3rd grade longer than original?
	- "I like how the tone sort of shifts"
	- What to do if the phrase still doesn't make sense?
	- what's stopping her from paying for it is the limited number of textbooks
	- Base price on Chegg?
	- student discount
	- $20 a month
	- Where have you learned about...
		- Word-of-mouth (campus, friends, social media)
- People don't go to office hours because they're too busy...end up turning to chatGPT when they're crunching at midnight
