The Superhuman Playbook: Embodied Learning with Erica Appelros
- Cognitive embodiment
- Mirror neutrons ^
- When we watch others perform such an action, the same networks activated when we perform the action are activated
- Sixth sense/proprioception
- Our whole being is made to work in combination w/ each other
- ^ which is why isolated learning is boring
- Rituals are how we can apply learning
- Paying attention is key 
- You experience the emotion if you perform the facial expression
- ^ helps with recall
- Study: washing hands and watching video of washing hands can lessen guilt
- Store them in your body (related: The Body is the Score)

Design Everywhere
Episode: Information Futurism with Karl Fast
- Information futurism: where will we be going? When you step back and look at history, one of the most consistent trends is that you need info to build a good society
- Thinking in current paradigm v.s. Future paradigm
- Not going the optimal route (more steps vs less steps) gives you more information; more exploration

Episode: Embodied Learning with Karl Fast
- How do we (builders) to talk about the ways people interact with information?
- How mind, body, and world work together
- People deliberately made more moves in tetris bc it gave them more information
- Two classes of action: pragmatic (changing the world for the purpose of changing the world) and epistemic (actions we take into the world to make mental computations simpler)
- People try to use their body in problem-solving; it’s not just looking
- Legacy idea: brain does all of the work
- Embodiment: we are making a huge mistake by ignoring the body and its role in interacting
- ^ happening in design world
- People doing synthesis work and applying it to irl is important
- Example of epistemic interaction: probing

- networked multiself; internet of bodies, bound by sensors, implants, intuition, and dissolution of the boundaries between physical and virtual
- we're so educated to think in boxes, and people are afraid to go beyond their box, even if they're capable of it
- Be curious beyond your expertise ^
- Find in other sectors the common crossovers
- We need to put the body at the heart of the Internet
- We need the internet of bodies, which then the IoT works for
- ^ Why are we putting emphasis on the table or the fridge? When it does these things for YOU
