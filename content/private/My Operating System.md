Welcome to Bianca OS!
Intro paragraph
Values I stand by 
## The Framework
This is based on my learnings from Arianne Serafico, a BLANK. She created the Braver Goals Framework and Existential Courage.

## Core Values

### Empathy
(Empathy definition)

Empathy is a double-edged sword. It's responsible for one major flaw of mine: getting too emotional. This leads to another flaw: caring too much about others to the point that it affects me. But having empathy is also what enables me to be open-minded, allowing me to understand others. It's considered a design superpower too.

I've been wondering if there's a more appropriate value I can use instead, since empathy is used so much to the point that it's a empty word.

### Growth
(Growth definition)

As an enthusiastic autodidact, I wanted a value that would correspond to my love for learning. Why do I even like learning in the first place? It's because I get to grow. Improving day by day -- whether it's doing great at ballet class or receiving critique for a piece -- is so fulfilling for me; what feels even better is helping cultivate this process in others. 

Note: this value used to be Empowerment, but I replaced it because it didn't resonate with me as much as the other two.

### Grit
(Grit definition)

Passion and perseverance. People who know me will definitely agree that I truly embody these two values. I wear my heart on my sleeve, sharing my passions with the world. And I commit to these as much as I can, no matter how much time and energy it takes. Yes, I'm terrible at quitting.

## Purpose Identities
### Professional

### Personal


## Goal Hierarchies
After I knew my whys and who I wanted to become, I could decide what goals to set. First, I set long-term goals. These were ambitious and vague, since they were designed for a 5-year timeframe. Then, based on these, I created mid-term goals, which were more feasible and specific, being designed for a 1-year timeframe.
