## Notes
### Expanding the Shrunken Soul
> False humility is a preoccupation with the limitations of one's personal or social situation that can lead to a form of spiritual self-destruction. It involves shrinking oneself and one's abilities, denying one's own worth, and failing to recognize the God-given values in oneself and others. False humility can be detrimental to one's ability to engage creatively with the world. 

> On the other hand, true humility involves the gracious acceptance of God-given values found not only in one's own life and social class but also in potentially competing individuals and classes as well. True humility does not involve denying one's worth or abilities but rather recognizing them as gifts from God.
