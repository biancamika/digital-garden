## Notes
### General Structure of Discernment
- **Discernment:** ==right judgement==. The ability to distinguish what is authentically good from what is only apparently good.
- You do not discern between something that is clearly good and clearly evil (extremes of the moral spectrum).
	- We discern with **competing goods**.
	- *Pagkilatis:* the Filipino word for discernment.
		- Comes from the Spanish wood *kirates:* when a jeweler is trying to distinguish the authenticity of a diamond
- Discernment is not just a matter of the mind (comparing pros and cons is not enough). Make sure you ==listen to your **heart** too.==
	- The heart is the seat of your emotions. But it is also so much more than that.
- The heart is your **core**.
	- It is closer to what we know as your ==soul/essence==.
	- Here, you will find the seat of **your values**...what we consider important.
		- We see its value in our mind, in our experiences.
- So pay attention to **time** and **circumstances**.
	- Your emotions could be ==possible reactions== to your values.
	- The ==tools== you need in discernment are the head and heart, which both have to work together. But ==factors we cannot control==, such as time and circumstances, bind our discernment.

### Role of faith in discernment
- Theory: People aren't really angry at God; they're actually angry at **how it's presented to us**.
- Religion may be divinely inspired, but it is also **humanly constructed.** 
- 2 questions:
	- Is the way we live out our faith appropriate to the state of our life now? 
	- What image of God do we still hold today?
- 2 lessons about God from St. Thomas Aquinas (See [[The Flying Spaghetti Monster, Aristotle, and Fernando Amorsolo]]):
	- [[God is not a being]]
	- [[God is the condition of possibility that enables all other beings to exist]]
		- *Ipsum Esse Subsistens*: subsistent being itself.
		- Described as an **act**
- What we may often hear from loved ones: "I want what is best for you"
	- But how do we really know what's best for the one we love?
- Reality: We tend to impose our desire on the one we love.
	- Is that really what is best for them?
- **God does not impose his will**.
	- It's real love when you choose to commit...you're not forced to do it.
	- "The will of God"
	- **There's no blueprint.**
- Important thought: the will of God is not imposed on us from high above, but is often something we discover from **deep within**.
- So how can we perceive God's will? We need to examine our deepest life-giving **desires**. (Connected to [[Permanent Notes/Desire]])
	- If our life is a building...we can see desires as the raw material for discernment, and our head and heart as the tools we used to shape these desires.
	- When people say "This is God's plan for you", they're trying to perceive something we cannot. 
		- God is the epitome of a mystery. [[Permanent Notes/Problem versus Mystery]]
		- They're trying to cope with the chaos of life by assuming order. [[Permanent Notes/Order and Chaos]]
		- This shows an absolutely certain mindset; it's better to approach God from a place of wonder. [[Permanent Notes/Absolute Certainty versus Wonder]]

### Good & Evil
- Good and evil are typically assumed to be 2 equal and opposing forces.
- However, according to St. [[Thomas Aquinas]], it doesn't work that way. He believed that **all there is good**. 
- In line with this, his definition of evil was the **"privation of the good"**. (Remember: [[Evil is the privation of the good]])
	- It can be seen as an incomplete circle: a lack of what is supposed to be good
	- E.G. money being privatized so that others have a lack
- Thus, whenever we do evil, we actually see it as **good**, even if it's done in a mistaken way.
- Connected to [[Permanent Notes/Desire]]: The will **desires**. (e.g. "I will teach, study, etc."). But desire can lead us to evil, even if it appears good.
	- The will is **faculty** of desire.
- ^ Discernment helps us avoid this.
- A lack of good = a lack of ==energy/willpower.==
	- One of the things that reinforces laziness is when you overthink about it.
- If you pay attention to your good desires, how can they be opposed to God?
	- Just because it came from you doesn't mean it's against God

### Ignatian Discernment
- St. [[Ignatius of Loyola]] perceived discernment as **the ability to see God's will in one's life**.
- So if God's will is perceived through our deepest life-giving desires...
	- This refers to our **holy** desires
		- Does not mean "pious and out of this world"
		- Holy comes from the word whole
		- Thus, ==holy desires are the ones that make us whole==
- **[[Ignatian Spirituality]]:** a spirituality of desire. (See [[Permanent Notes/Desire]])
	- St. [[Ignatius of Loyola]] believed -- and this belief lies at the heart of [[Ignatian Spirituality]] -- that **our truest desires reflect God's desires in us and for us**.
- We need to distinguish our **surface wants** from our **deep desires**.
	- This can be difficult though...like distinguishing M&M's and Skittles, or distinguishing water and vodka.
- Example: desire for money
