## Notes
![[Resource Notes/The Spiritual Exercises#Annotation 316]]

- Salvation comes from *salis*: =="good health"== (of all kinds)
	- Good health is acquired through good decisions
- Whatever leads you **towards** deeper love and greater joy 
	- "I am in the right place"
- Consolation makes you feel **free, authentic, and courageous** in giving yourself to something greater than yourself.
	- Lack of freedom -> lack of authenticity
- The fruit of **consolation** is **peace**.
