### Neuroplasticity: How to Use Your Brain’s Malleability to Improve Your Well-being
- Neuroplasticity can be seen as **the capacity for our brain cells to change in response to our behavior**. This can affect us positively or negatively.
- Neuroplastic change occurs at the chemical, structual, and functional levels of the brain.
- Neuroplastic change requires five components:
	- Challenge & Novelty
	- Intention
	- Specific Attention
	- Repetition & Intensity
	- Time

### Neuroplasticity, Emotional Healing, and Chronic Illness
> We now know that the brain has a tremendous capacity for repair and renewal, if it is given the right tools to do so. The primary mechanism through which the damaged brain can repair and restore itself is called “neuroplasticity.”

> Neuroplasticity is defined as ==the ability of the brain to form and reorganize the synaptic connections between neurons.== Neuroplasticity is an essential component of the learning process and of the brain’s response to injury, including traumatic brain injury (TBI) and stroke. Essentially, neuroplasticity refers to ==the brain’s ability to “rewire” itself in response to new experiences and information.==
> Neuroplasticity is a two-way street; stressful, traumatic experiences impact neuroplasticity, causing the brain to develop and repeatedly utilize maladaptive pathways that are not conducive to optimal health. Conversely, neuroplasticity can also be harnessed in beneficial ways to help individuals overcome stressful and traumatic experiences.
