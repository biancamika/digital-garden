	- Module 1A
		- [[Permanent Notes/Problem versus Mystery]]:  If we treat the question “Who am I?” as a problem, we answer with our tangibles. But if we treat “Who am I?” as a mystery, we acknowledge that there is more to us than this constructed persona
		- [[Permanent Notes/Absolute Certainty versus Wonder]]: wholely defining ourselves according to our tangibles comes from a reductionist mindset.
		- [[Permanent Notes/Order and Chaos]]: To live a good life, we need to learn how to treat our tangibles like advisors instead of dictators. This requires a balance between order and chaos; the former gives us the direction we need while the latter teaches us adaptation.
		- [[Permanent Notes/Perfectionism]]: Perfectionists create avatars of themselves with their own tangibles.
		- [[Permanent Notes/Desire]]: Tangibles, at their core, reflect desires

## Notes
- **Who am I?** is a hard question to answer because we are complex and constantly changing
- We all have an **Instagram avatar:** an embellished online version of one's self normally constructed using the hgihlights of one's life.
	- 1-dimensional, low-resolution
	- There's always a level of curation
	- We tend to compare **our reality** to other people's highlights, even in real life.
- According to [[Henri Nouwen]], we define our identites according to our **tangibles**.
	- These are what we use to create a certain **avatar** that we present to the world.
	- These aren't bad; they're all necessary.

- Tangibles are concrete and measurable, but they are also **fleeting and unreliable.**
	- A life dictated by tangibles is a life of **mere survival.**
	- This is what Parker Palmer (in [[Images of Integrity / Across the Great Divide]]) calls [[Permanent Notes/The Divided Life]]
- Oftentimes, the problem is that we treat the tangibles like dictators instead of advisors.
- Richard Rohr gives a distinction between [[Permanent Notes/The False Self]] and [[Permanent Notes/The True Self]]; the former is our shell, while the latter is our core.

- When the tangibles are gone, what will be left of us?
	- If the tangibles make up [[Permanent Notes/The False Self]]...
	- ...perhaps [[Permanent Notes/The True Self]] is what remains
