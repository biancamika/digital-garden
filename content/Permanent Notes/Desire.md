## Notes
- **Desire** is the ==energy that moves our lives.==
	- Desire is inherent to all of us, as shown by Ronald Rolheiser: "...Everyone is ultimately talking about the same thing -- an unquenchable fire, a restlessness, a longing, a disquiet, a hunger, a loneliness, a gnawing nostalgia, a wildness that cannot be tamed, **a cogenital all embracing ache that lies at the center of human experience and is the ultimate force that drives everything else.** This disease is universal."
	- Desire is the ==natural faculty of **introspection.**==
		- Aim to be comfortable about reflecting on who you are and where you are.
		- We are like cars. If you go on long rides, you need to check your engine, right? Similarily, we need to constantly check ourselves when we are pursuing anything long-term in life.
- Your incompletion (or your [[Permanent Notes/Brokenness]]) is manifested in your desires.
- Moving forward: we will need to know how to channel these desires properly so that they can bring about a good life. 
	- That's what [[Permanent Notes/Discernment]] is for.
	- What's your relationship with your desires? ==Are you mastering them, or are they mastering you?==
		- If you master them, you can convert your desire into something ==value-adding==.
		- There is no such thing as a bad desire...**at its core**. It only becomes  bad/tainted when it surfaces to the level of **action** (where it becomes destructive to you and others).
			- So think about what lays underneath the desire. For instance, acts of murder can be rooted in a desire for justice.
		- Desire is supposed to **free** you into becoming the person you want to be. It is **liberating.** When it's not, it becomes an **attachment** (see [[Permanent Notes/Disordered attachments]]). 
			- They should lead you to something greater.
		- There is no such thing as the absence of desire; there is only the **ignorance** of it.
		- Contentment isn't antithetical to desire...make sure to distinguish this from settling.
- Back to puzzles (a.k.a. Desire and its connection to [[Permanent Notes/Perfectionism]])
	- Do not be afraid of your imperfections; they point to the bigger story of your life.
	- Instead, be weary of [[Permanent Notes/Perfectionism]]; that means there's no more story left to tell.
	- Never ever lose sight of the bigger picture.
	- R.M. Rilke: "...Live the questions now. Perhaps you will then gradually, without ntoicing it, live along some distant day into the answer."
		- [[The real answering comes in the living]].
		- Don't let your desires define you. Remember, there is more to a meal (a.k.a. your life) than your bread-&-butter (a.k.a. core desire). Enrich it with other desires as well.
			- How can we find this core desire? Make sense of previous expereinces. Look at the things that have given you life. 
			- So early in your career, make **learning** ypur biggest priority. Don't be a perfectionist; fight the urge to get things right immediately.
- The way of the deepest desire (or the Strategy of Liberation) can lead us to [[Permanent Notes/The True Self]]
