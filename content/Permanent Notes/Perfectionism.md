## Notes
- The relationship between **puzzles** and perfection
	- Imagine a puzzle piece shaped like a perfect shape...there is no such thing. ==The imperfection makes it what it is.==
	- A puzzle piece has an imperfect shape so it can ==connect to a bigger picture.==
	- What does it really mean to be perfect?
- **Perfection:** excessive control over the processes and outcomes of one's life 
	- Flawlessness; nothing goes wrong; nothing needs to be added
		- always defined in terms of ==the negative==
	- perfectionists have rigid views of the world
	- The roots of anxiety and depression come from perfectionist attitudes
	- 3 insights about its **dangers:**
		- [[Perfectionism disables us from seeing life as it truly is]]
			- Perfectionism ==shelters== you from real-life situations: its difficulties, complexities, and paradoxes.
				- E.G. Ateneo can be seen as the perfect campus...but it can also lead to students living sheltered lifestyles.
			- Reality does not perfectly fit what we want it to be.
				- Life is full of mysteries, not just problems. See: [[Permanent Notes/Problem versus Mystery]]
			- When it comes to dating, this is a common mentality: "I would have rather have real than perfect."
				- But remember: your fixation on the perfect might be ==keeping you from the real goal. ==
				- ^ Relevant to the examples mentioned by Margaret Self in "[[Resource Notes/Inner Compass]]"
		- [[Perfectionism renders growth unnecessary and obsolete]]
			- If perfection is such a dangerous thing, then why pursue it at all? Should we just settle for mediocrity, then?
				- The way elite athletes handle defeat is fascinating. The best have a good attitude. Defeats are not attacks on ego; they're learning opportunties. (Remember: [[Defeats are learning opportunties]])
				- Being a great athlete is not always about winning, but also about learning how to lose well. (Remember: [[Learn how to lose well]])
				- "Gracious in defeat"
				- If you truly have respect for your game, you know that there is always so much more to learn.
			- The good life is about being in a **dynamic state of growth** rather than a static state of perfection.
			- Mediocrity is judged in the process, not in the result. 
				- What makes you truly mediocre is not giving your best effort.
		- [[Perfectionism makes us harm ourselves and others more]]
			- Examples:
				- Hitler's genocide and Duterte's *tokhang*. Both of these exemplify how conceptions of what is clean and pure have negative connotations, since they are often used to perpetuate evil.
				- Tiger parents, disagreements with loved ones
			- Perfectionism has **victims.**
- Important: [[Do not let the perfect be the enemy of the good]].
	- ==The good is consistently real==, while perfection is often an illusion.
	- ^ So you can find peace and gratitude in this.
	- Advice: Don't become **too fixed on your goal** to the point that you forget **the joy of the process.**
- The good enables you to be **grateful** for what you have now, and **desirous** for what is better. This is where [[Permanent Notes/Desire]] comes in.
