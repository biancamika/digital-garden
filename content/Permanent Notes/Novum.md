## Notes
- Suvin anchors science fiction on what he terms the **_[[Permanent Notes/Novum]]_**, the =="strange newness"== at the heart of a science fiction work. The _novum_ is **the fantastic element of a text, the point of difference between a science fiction text and the reality in which the text exists.** 
- A work can, of course, have multiple _nova_, ranging from people to creatures to technology to places to physical laws and phenomena. 
- The _novum_ follows the logic of science fiction: in a good science fiction story, the _novum_ has a =="literary" resonance==--it carries a kind of social, cultural, or symbolic meaning with it--but exists in the world of the story through ==scientific logic and rules. ==
- When we see Godzilla, we think of a metaphor for the atom bomb, a wild force of power and destruction, but he exists in the world of the text as a mutant creature, an accident of genetics. And the best science fiction stories ==portray the metaphorical and logical sides of the _novum_ as in harmony with each other==: Godzilla is mutated, usually, by radiation from the atom bomb, so even in the world of the text, he is the embodied power of the weapon that he represents.
