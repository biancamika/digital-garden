## Reference
- **Source:** [[DLQ 10 MOC]]
- **Keywords:** [[Permanent Notes/permanent notes]]
- **Relevant Notes:**
	- Module 1A
		- [[Permanent Notes/Problem versus Mystery]]: the straightforward nature of problems make them appealing for those who desire order, while mysteries are really chaotic...hence why they teach us how to adjust
		- [[Permanent Notes/Absolute Certainty versus Wonder]]: the former happens when we crave for too much order; the latter happens when we allow for balance
		- [[Permanent Notes/Perfectionism]]: perfectionists always desire order in their lives.
		- [[Permanent Notes/Desire]]: if desire is the energy that moves our lives, then being able to channel our desires means allowing spce for both order and chaos
	- Module 1B
		- [[Permanent Notes/The First Principle and Foundation]]
		- [[Permanent Notes/Discernment]]: 
		- [[Permanent Notes/Desolation]]: 
		- [[Permanent Notes/Consolation]]:
	- Module 2
		- [[Permanent Notes/Tangibles]]: To live a good life, we need to learn how to treat our tangibles like advisors instead of dictators. This requires a balance between order and chaos; the former gives us the direction we need while the latter teaches us adaptation.
		- [[Permanent Notes/The Divided Life]]: a Divided Life consists of either too much order or too much chaos.
		- [[Permanent Notes/Brokenness]]: A balanced approach is needed in order to make the most of our brokenness.
		- [[Permanent Notes/The False Self]]: Both The False Self and The True Self are integral to our identities; to live a good life, we must balance these selves by closing the gap between them (a.k.a. integrating our role and our soul).
		- [[Permanent Notes/Self-rejection]]: Self-rejection can happen either through self-restriction (excessive order) or self-indulgence (excessive chaos).

## Notes
- Why are Ateneans so indecisive? Why do we always say "Yes and no"
	- Because we approach things with nuance, knowing that we live in a world full of nuances
- Thinking in absolutes leads to **deadly polarizations.** (See [[Permanent Notes/Absolute Certainty versus Wonder]])
- **Traps in decision-making** are disabling to living.
	- Analysis paralysis: cannot decide
	- Absolute certainty: already decided 
	- Apathetic  avoidance: not caring
- **Order** = what we know; **chaos** = what we don't know
- We need both **order and chaos** to live a good life.
	- Chaos strengthens order, makes it more flexible.
	- But of course, you can have too much order.
	- Imagine a life of pure order or pure chaos.
- Order sets the **direction**; chaos teaches you how to **adjust**.
- E.G. Rock v.s. bamboo as pictures of strength
	- Rocks are too predictable, doesn't allow flexibility and growth
	- Bamboos are more flexible and adaptable, making them better images of strength
	- Balance = simultaneously structured and spontaneous
- The world is complex and paradoxical...make a **firm decision** that comes from **careful consideration.** 
- Partial and resonable certitude.
