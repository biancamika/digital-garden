## Notes
- We need both **order and chaos** to live a good life.

	- But of course, you can have too much order.
	- Imagine a life of pure order or pure chaos.
- Order sets the **direction**; chaos teaches you how to **adjust**.
- The world is complex and paradoxical...make a **firm decision** that comes from **careful consideration.**
