## Notes
> The **Fermi paradox** is the discrepancy between the lack of conclusive evidence of advanced [extraterrestrial life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life "Extraterrestrial life") compared to the apparently high [a priori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_priori_and_a_posteriori "A priori and a posteriori") likelihood of its existence. As a 2015 article put it, "If life is so easy, someone from somewhere must have come calling by now."

> The universe ought to be a cacophony of voices, but instead it is disconcertingly quiet. Some humans theorize that intelligent species go extinct before they can expand into outer space.
