## Notes
According to the **[[Permanent Notes/Competitive Exclusion Principle]]**, ==no two species can occupy the same niche at the same time indefinitely.== Two species can compete for the same resource for only so long; the outcompeted will have to diverge from the niche and thus potentially become a new species, or else go extinct.
