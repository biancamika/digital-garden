- God is a paradox, for he is both transcendent and personal.
	- We see his personal side through Jesus, who is God made incarnate.

### Summary
> The world is full of **mysteries**, not just problems. The world is also full of paradoxes & complementaries. Therefore, [[What we know is always limited]].

> Mysteries are approached with a sense of wonder. And this wonder is undergirded by a **disposition of humility.**
 
See [[Permanent Notes/Absolute Certainty versus Wonder]]

> We need to stop **black-and-white thinking.** While there is nothing wrong with simplifying a complex world, there is such a thing as **oversimplification.**
