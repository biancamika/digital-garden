## Notes
- Embraces the ==polarizing== nature of humanity by allowing opposites to coexist
- basically like a ==pendulum==; constant ==oscillation==
- In comparison to other philosophies:
	- **Modernism:** maximalist + optimistic;  *"Make it new!"*; creators want to  be godlike and make hsitory
	- **Postmodernism:** skeptical + disillusioned; no longer believe in a universal reality
- Metamodernism is basically the [[Permanent Notes/Sweet Spot]] between these two philosophies
- associated with not just the Age of the Internet, but the ==Age of the Online Creator==
	- E.G. fanfiction, remixes, memes, vlogging
- Creators should be Metamodernists (see [[Literature Notes/Fakepixels - Literature Notes]] **Vol.58**)
