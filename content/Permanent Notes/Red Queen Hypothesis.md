## Notes
- Red Queen in *Alice in Wonderland:* "Now, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place."
- A species must adapt and evolve not just for reproductive advantage, but also for survival because competing organisms also are evolving
	- Note: the environment, not just surrounding organisms, is also changing!
