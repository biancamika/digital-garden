## Article
> Why does Readwise focus so much on retention? For the same reasons that founders should reduce churn in a SaaS business before investing in growth; or investors should buffer their portfolios against losses before seeking gains; or bodybuilders should prevent muscle loss before adding lean mass. ==No matter what youâ€™re doing, the best way to grow is to first prevent losses.  ==
> Think of it this way: If you've got a leaky bucket, you're better off fixing the leak before pouring water in the top. For those of you who prefer numbers: If you start with a portfolio worth $100 and lose 50%, you now need to earn 100% to breakeven.  
> This principle, of course, also extends to learning.

## Notes
- [[Permanent Notes/Willpower and motivation is finite]]
	- Fixing problems saves us more time and energy in the long run
- Counter-argument to this: [[Permanent Notes/The greatest enemy of creative success is the attempt to fortify against failure]]
	- If we always try to prevent failure, we'd barely grow. It's a manifestation of perfectionism. Remember, [[Perfectionism renders growth unnecessary and obsolete]]
