## Notes
- **For people to share concepts, they have to remember them.** What’s “top-of-mind” easily becomes “tip-of-tongue.”
- A marketer’s job is to find or create triggers that will naturally spark the thought of the product or idea in customers. As famous psychologist [Daniel Kahneman](https://fourminutebooks.com/thinking-fast-and-slow-summary/) has shown, ==the human mind remembers things by connecting them with other memories.==
- This association mechanism allows ideas to be recalled repeatedly by many people throughout their day or week. Tapping into this aspect of human psychology results in virality.
