## Notes
- Our strongest enemy is **self-rejection**.
	- It's why we fall into the temptations of the [[Permanent Notes/Tangibles]].
		- 1st effect of self-rejection
	- We easily depend on these when we believe that there is no [[Permanent Notes/The True Self]]
		- We think that we are worthless and unlovable
		- "I tend to blame myself -- not just for what I did, but for who I am."
- According to [[Brene Brown]] in *[[The Gifts of Imperfection]]*, the difference between shame and guilt is best understood as the differences between **"I am bad"** and **"I did something bad".**
	- Guilt = "I did somethig bad."
	- Shame = "I am bad."
		- The moment you associate your mistake with your character...it becomes harder to address that. Changing identities is difficult.
		- This is the 2nd effect of self-rejection: it's harder to be accountable
			- Remember: your [[Permanent Notes/Brokenness]] is an explanation, not an excuse
- If self-rejection is your default, "your life can be scarcely more than a long struggle for survival."
	- A.K.A. [[Permanent Notes/The Divided Life]]
	- You cannot truly know yourself if your default step is to **reject yourself.**
