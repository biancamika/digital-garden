# Welcome! 👋 

Hi, I'm Bianca. Welcome to my digital garden, where I nurture my thoughts. I take notes because I have too many tabs open in my 5 MB brain :') and don't want to forget all the wonderful things I get to learn.

Warning: This website is forever a work in progress! Some notes may have weird formatting too + broken links. Currently trying to fix that.
