title: "Be water my friend"
---
- Bruce Lee embodies the ideas of fluidity. After practicing multiple martial arts, he went on to develop his own philosophy of martial arts called Jeet Kune Do. It is not really a new style, as it is a non-style.

> _“Be like water making its way through cracks. Do not be assertive, but adjust to the object, and you shall find a way around or through it. If nothing within you stays rigid, outward things will disclose themselves."_

- The parallel's between Jeet Kune Do and the LYT frameworks are fascinating.
- Both do not get stuck in passive patterns. Instead the fluid thinker working with LYT frameworks naturally follows Bruce Lee's statement:

> _“Adapt what is useful, reject what is useless, and add what is specifically your own.”_

> _"Empty your mind, be formless. Shapeless, like water. If you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup. You put water into a bottle and it becomes the bottle. You put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Now, water can flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend.”_
