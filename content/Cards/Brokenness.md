## Notes
- There are 2 ways we **experience** brokenness:
	- **Malicious:** the hurts *deliberately* done against us.
	- **Accidental:** the hurts we experience *indirectly* as a result of being the collateral damage of other people's bad actions.
- What brokenness does to us:
	- Our brokenness alienates us from ourselves.
	- We tend to define ourselves according to our wounds.
- Our brokenness has the **potential** to...
	- ...reveal who we truly are and what we deeply desire ([[Cards/The True Self]])
	- ...create your worst compulsions ([[Cards/Disordered attachments]])
		- **Weakness** and **badness** is the bitter fruit of brokenness.
		- "We sin from the point of weakness"
- So what makes the difference? It depends on how you act on it. Here are the 2 ways we **act on** our brokenness:
	- **Bitterness:** allow the hurt to take over our decisions and actions.
		- "Hurt people **hurt** people."
		- Our brokenness manifests in subtle yet sinister ways in our [[Cards/Disordered attachments]]
		- E.G. getting infected by COVID -> spreading the virus (even if you're "asymptomatic")
	- **Compassion:** use the hurt as a way to connect with the hurt of others.
		- "Hurt people **heal** people."
		- E.G. getting infected by COVID -> using the virus to create antibodies
- So remember: Getting in touch with the pain of your brokenness enables you to get in touch with [[Cards/The True Self]].
	- There is something within all of us that needs healing.
		- The mark of a mature person is acknowledging this.
		- Growing old doesn't necessarily mean you're growing up.
	- Your brokenness is a part of you, but you are not your brokenness.
		- Defining yourself solely by your brokenness = [[Cards/The False Self]]
	- So ask yourself: what are you doing with your brokenness?
		- It is better to be self-aware than to be self-righteous
- Problem: We often do not want to confront **what hurts us**.
	- The source/s of our aches may not always be clear.
	- Your aches reveal both your **desires** and your **unfreedoms**. [[Cards/Desire]]
	- Henri Nouwen encourages embracing our brokenness; there are things you learn about yourself in failure that ==you can't learn in success.==

- Healing the wounds of our soul is not about **pain removal**, but about **pain management**.
