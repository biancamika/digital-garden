## Notes
- An extension for [[Stable Diffusion]] that ==creates image maps from existing images== to control composition and human poses.
- serves as a conditioning mechanism for controlling the generation of images in a controlled and predictable manner. 
- the primary purpose of ControlNet is to ==learn and predict the desired noise level== at each stage of the generative process.
	- **Noise level:** the degree of randomness, variability, or uncertainty introduced into the creative process.
