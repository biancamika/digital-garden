## Notes
- *Collatio* is a form of scripture reading that is ==devotional ==in nature.
- It can be done alone (with a journal), or in groups.
- How it works:
	- Read the scripture passage once, and allow some time for reflection.
	- Read the passage a second time, then think of **one word** that speaks to or resonates with you.
	- Read the passage a third time, then think of **one phrase** that speaks to or resonates with you.
	- Read the passage a fourth time, then come up with a **prayer** based on the passage and your reflection.
