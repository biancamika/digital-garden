## Notes
- **True Self:** you at your core; not tangbile
	- It is hard to find one's True Self; you cannot find it like any other object. You can only get =="in touch"== with it.
		- ==You cannot lie to yourself about your feelings.==
	- But one good place to start is to acknowledge that we are not defined by the [[Cards/Tangibles]].
	- There is **something deeper** that makes us who we are.
- How do you get in touch with [[Cards/The True Self]]?
	- Through pain.
		- Remember: why does the body experience pain? Pain is an indicator that something is wrong in the body, and it needs your attention.
		- Pain gives you a **truthful** indicator of what goes on in your body.
		- "The gateway to freedom is an **initial experience of pain**"
	- Thus, to know who you truly are means to get in touch with the pains of your [[Cards/Brokenness]].
- What makes finding [[Cards/The True Self]] difficult is the shame associated with it.
	- E.G. "Show me your truly colors"
	- Why do people find this shameful? Perhaps because of external pressures, which leads us into living [[Cards/The Divided Life]]
	- Thus, our strongest enemy is [[Cards/Self-rejection]].
