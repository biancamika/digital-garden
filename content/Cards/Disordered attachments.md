## Notes
### On Addiction
- Good definition of **addiction**: It starts when you drink the bottle, and ends with the bottle drinking you.
	- Consumer -> consumed
- Related to Margaret Silf's [[Sources/Inner Compass]] reading: A disordered attachment is like a **hook**. It makes **you lose your freedom.**
- Summary of [[Cards/The First Principle and Foundation]]: God desires that we experience the best life we can live. The people and things in our lives are meant to aid towards that best possible life.
- Warning: But it's possible to get **attached to** or **hooked on** people and things.
	- When your whole life revolves around some thing, person, idea, or experience...even if it's supposedly good.
	- ==Attachment starts with good things==...things that feel good.

### Introduction to Attachments
- So while some attachments can be healthy, well-ordered commitments, others can become unhealthy, destructive obsessions.
- These are **disordered attachments:** an unhealthy dependence on any **thing, person, idea, or experience** that keeps us from fulfilling the will of God which is to live the best life we can.
	- Disordered attachments shrink our world into the confines of our unhealthy and destructive self -- ==preoccupation==
	- Rule of Thumb: If it causes you and others harm, then it is likely a disordered attachment.
		- Note: harm isn't always immediate
	- Remember: disordered attachments lead to **disordered decisions.**
		- So don't discern when you're attached! You'd lack the interior freedom to decide properly
