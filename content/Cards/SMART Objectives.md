## Notes

- **Specific** - The learning objective should be well defined and clear. It states exactly what will be accomplished.
- **Measurable** - The learning objective should provide a benchmark or target so that the institution can determine when the target has been reached, by how much it has been exceeded or by how much it has fallen short.
- **Attainable -** Can the objective be accomplished in the proposed time frame with the available resources and support? Do the students have the prior learning necessary to accomplish the objective?
- **Relevant -** Does the objective address the overall program goal(s)? Will the objective have an impact on the goal(s)?
- **Time-Bound -** A learning objective should include a specific date (or point in the course) by which it will be completed. It is important to allow enough time to successfully implement the steps needed to achieve the objective, but not so much as to elicit procrastination.
