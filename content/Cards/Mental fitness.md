## Notes
### Delphi study
> The final definition of mental fitness is “the modifiable capacity to ==utilise resources and skills to flexibly adapt== to challenges or advantages, enabling thriving”

> The final four guiding principles are (1) fitness is a positive term without connotations of illness implied by mental health or mental illness; (b) mental fitness could be understood by the wider community in a similar way to physical fitness; (c) mental fitness is measurable; and (d) ==mental fitness can be improved, in a similar way to physical fitness.==

> The challenge is how to further engage and motivate the wider community to not only become ==proactive== in their own positive mental health strategies and activities, but to ==sustain them==.

> In summary, the definition suggests that a mentally fit person has a reserve of psychological resources and skills that can be readily utilised to increase the probability of a successful response to a negative stressor or an opportunity. Further, it suggests that a mentally fit person would be expected to have high self-awareness and self-regulation to elicit a psychologically flexible response

> ...mental fitness can be learned via developmental activities, exercises and regular practice to ‘fit’ assessed needs. Evidence in positive psychology and the neural plasticity literature suggests the brain has the ability to change and adapt as a result of experience and learning new behaviours throughout life.

### Psychological warfare
> Mental fitness can be defined as ==being aware== of one’s own thoughts, emotions, and feelings that influence a human behavior. It is a process of cultivating the ability to handle difficult situations, building resilience, maintaining a state of well-being, and developing mental strength to stay calm and composed without being affected by emotional turbulence

> Attempting to address the current mental health problem and to provide solution, this paper aims to propose a model for mental fitness guide with an acronym SPORTS that consists of six components, such as ==Self-awareness, Preparation, Optimism, Resilience, Team spirit, and Self-motivation==
