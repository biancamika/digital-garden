## Notes
> Psychological Fitness is the ability to ==integrate and improve cognitive, emotional, and behavioral practices.== Staying mission-ready means having a healthy, high functioning mind, which connects to every domain of Total Force Fitness.
> Mental health and mental toughness are not binary-options with an “on/off switch” – they exist on a spectrum, and you can train the mind and learn skills to improve. Psychological health takes practice and training. ==Just like any other part of your body, the more you exercise it, the stronger and more resilient it gets.==
> Emotions are part of psychological fitness. We all have them for a reason and suppressing them is not the answer. Find constructive ways to express feelings and cope with difficult emotions that otherwise could affect mission readiness.

> Psychological fitness, as part of the Total Force Fitness (TFF) construct, is defined as the ==integration and optimization of cognitive processes and abilities, behaviors, and emotions to positively affect performance, well-being, and response to stress.== These resilience factors can be thought of as antecedents of a complex process whereby individuals deal with stress. As such, they provide the foundation for psychological fitness.
