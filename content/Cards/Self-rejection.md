	- Module 1A
		- [[Cards/Problem versus Mystery]]: When we reject ourselves, we treat ourselves as a problem. Accepting that we are mysteries is crucial for getting to truly know ourselves
		- [[Cards/Absolute Certainty versus Wonder]]: When we reject ourselves, we resort to reductionism. A sense of wonder is needed in order to accept ourselves.
		- [[Cards/Order and Chaos]]: Self-rejection can happen either through self-restriction (excessive order) or self-indulgence (excessive chaos).
		- [[Cards/Perfectionism]]: Perfectionist tendencies make us reject ourselves. 
		- [[Cards/Desire]]: When we reject ourselves, making our desires value-adding is impossible.

## Notes
- Our strongest enemy is **self-rejection**.
	- It's why we fall into the temptations of the [[Cards/Tangibles]].
		- 1st effect of self-rejection
	- We easily depend on these when we believe that there is no [[Cards/The True Self]]
		- We think that we are worthless and unlovable
		- "I tend to blame myself -- not just for what I did, but for who I am."
- According to [[Brene Brown]] in *[[The Gifts of Imperfection]]*, the difference between shame and guilt is best understood as the differences between **"I am bad"** and **"I did something bad".**
	- Guilt = "I did somethig bad."
	- Shame = "I am bad."
		- The moment you associate your mistake with your character...it becomes harder to address that. Changing identities is difficult.
		- This is the 2nd effect of self-rejection: it's harder to be accountable
			- Remember: your [[Cards/Brokenness]] is an explanation, not an excuse
- If self-rejection is your default, "your life can be scarcely more than a long struggle for survival."
	- A.K.A. [[Cards/The Divided Life]]
	- You cannot truly know yourself if your default step is to **reject yourself.**
