## Notes
- The Understanding by Design® framework (UbDTM framework) offers **a planning process and structure to guide curriculum, assessment, and instruction.**
	- Based on the eponymous book by Grant Wiggins and Jay McTighe
- Its two key ideas are contained in the title: **1) focus on teaching and assessing for understanding and learning transfer**, and **2) design curriculum “backward” from those ends.**

### Three Stages of Backward Design
The UbD framework offers a three-stage backward design process for curriculum planning, and includes a template and set of design tools that embody the process. A key concept in UbD framework is ==alignment== (i.e., all three stages must clearly align not only to standards, but also to one another). In other words, the Stage 1 con- tent and understanding must be what is assessed in Stage 2 and taught in Stage 3.

1. **Identify Desired Results**
2. **Determine Assessment Evidence**
3. **Plan Learning Experiences and Instruction**
