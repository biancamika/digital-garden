## Notes
- Parker Palmer (in [[Sources/Images of Integrity - Across the Great Divide]], defines **The Divided Life** as living according to personas (which are created from [[Cards/Tangibles]])
- What this looks like: 
	- Imagine dancing in a drum circle where people play many **different** beats.
		- It all becomes noise.
	- "Always trying to stay above the line"; head above water
