## Notes
### Process
1. Transcription and Familiarization
2. Coding
	1. 1st round: highlight every single point of significance
	2. 2nd round: more selective; consolidate similar codes under single headings + remove insignificant codes
3. Creation of codebook
	1. Could be established, developed, and tested prior to a 3rd round of coding
	2. Elements:
		1. Label
		2. Definition
		3. Criteria for when to use + when not to use
		4. Example
	3. Can be applied in a final round of coding to look at each highlighted (coded) phrase and see if it is a good representation of the code
4. Development of themes
	1. Codes are specific and concise, while themes can be much more complex and can consolidate a multitude of codes to theoretically explain phenomena
5. Theorizing
