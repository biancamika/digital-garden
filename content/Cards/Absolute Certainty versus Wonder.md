## Notes

- **Absolute Certainty:** a.k.a. resorting to [[Cards/Reductionism]]: looking at a complex world from a simplistic perspective 
	- In reality, we always operate with ==limited certainty==; absolute certainty does NOT exist. ^b03b53
		- We are not capable of fitting the largeness/complexity of this world in our minds
		- Reductionist thinking dilutes meaning
	- Two types of [[Cards/Reductionism]]: ^0eb33d
		- **Fundamentalism:** A firm and rigid adherence to a fundamental set of beliefs and doctrines.
			- E.G. Religious circles — legalistic, laws are laws "Adam & Eve, not Adam & Steve"
			- Less about thinking, more about ==following==
		- **Relativism:** Truth is ultimately dependent on the individual or a group. Objective truth does not exist.
			- The other extreme; the forwarding of so many different "truths" — losing objective truths and ==losing a shared sense of reality==
			- Also does not require thinking
	- Either way, both of these reveal a proclivity towards **control.** Thus, absolute certainty ==focuses on control==.
		- It leads us to closse ourselves off to the possibilities of other things.
- **Wonder:** the disposition of a learner.
	- It's **constantly revisiting the ordinary**, being able to see it from fresh eyes and different perspectives.
	- It's undergirded by a disposition of **humility**. It's about ==knowing who you are== right now — seeing the truth of who you are, rather than pulling yourself down. 
		- The root word of humility , *humus* , means soil. A seedling in soil is vulnerable, exposed to the elements and vermin — yet this is also where it grows. [[Cards/Growth happens in vulnerability]]. ^cbbc87
		- This is one way you can discern a life question that will result in change or status quo — **will you grow?** ^fc16e2
	- You can only get to know more about a mystery (See [[Cards/Problem versus Mystery]]) when you **commit** to it with wonder. ^952b2f
		- [[Cards/We grow when we let go]].

### Summary
> Mysteries are approached with a sense of wonder. And this wonder is undergirded by a **disposition of humility.**

See [[Cards/Problem versus Mystery]]

> We need to stop **black-and-white thinking.** While there is nothing wrong with simplifying a complex world, there is such a thing as **oversimplification.**
