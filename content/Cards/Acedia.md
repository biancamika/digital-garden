## Notes
- **[[Cards/Acedia]] (sloth):** "the loss of care"
	- A loss of urgency, passion, desire to do something
	- Think: Have you fit the noontime of your commitments? Acedia is the temptation (our reaction)
	- Definitions
		- St. [[Thomas Aquinas]] defined Acedia as ==*taedium operandi:==* "disgust towards work"
		- He also defined it as ==*tristitia de bono divino*:== "a sorrow towards a spiritual good"
			- Sadness someone feels towards being loved
	- How does acedia manifest itself? (in our efforts towards maganimity)
		- Giving up easily when boredom strikes
			- We need to remember that boredom does not equal to ==being in the wrong place==
			- Think beyond boredom!
				- We tend to rationalize leaving out of boredom in many ways: unhappiness, lack of growth, etc.
				- Just because you are unhappy does *not* necessarily mean that you are not growing
				- Commitment > passion. Commitment is consistent, while passion is like the weather -- which comes and goes
					- Think about long-term trajectory
			- Going uphill is tiring but it stregnthens you
		- Desolation v.s. boredom
			- Desolation leads to our worst instincts
			- Boredom is just a shallow sign of this ^
		- Getting constantly distracted
			- You can be active in acedia...doing everything but what you need to do. Acedia = ==procrastination==
			- **Procrastination is not laziness.** It just means ==being busy doing the wrong things.==
			- We ignore the call to love, because the most important person is ourselves. (See: Self-love and [[Cards/Pusillanimity]])
	- The solution to acedia: **Fight it head-on.** (Just keep swimming!)
