## Notes
 The concept of the **[[Cards/Niche]]**, ecologically speaking, is ==the set of all possible environmental conditions that will allow a population to sustain itself.==
  - According to the **[[Cards/Competitive Exclusion Principle]]**, ==no two species can occupy the same niche at the same time indefinitely.== Two species can compete for the same resource for only so long; the outcompeted will have to diverge from the niche and thus potentially become a new species, or else go extinct. 
  - A lot of sci-fi worlds with vicious apex predators, especially intelligent ones, probably won their dominance in this way. And then there are those that expand their genetic reach in even more fearsome ways: through forceful parasitism and assimilation.
