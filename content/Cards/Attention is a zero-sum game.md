## Notes
- **Zero-sum game:** situation where one's gain is another's loss
- So paying more attention to one thing will mean that we pay less attention to others
- Attention is a ==finite== resource; it needs to be spent wisely
- Information abundance simply means we have infinite opportunities to react to data.
	- The question is: which ones will we react to?

>Whenever we point to “information abundance,” what we are really saying is that we have ==“endless opportunities to react to data.”==
