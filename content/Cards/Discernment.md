## Notes
### Introduction to Discernment
- **Discernment:** ==right judgement==. The ability to distinguish what is authentically good from what is only apparently good.
- You do not discern between something that is clearly good and clearly evil (extremes of the moral spectrum).
	- We discern with **competing goods**.
	- *Pagkilatis:* the Filipino word for discernment.
		- Comes from the Spanish wood *kirates:* when a jeweler is trying to distinguish the authenticity of a diamond
- Discernment is not just a matter of the mind (comparing pros and cons is not enough). Make sure you ==listen to your **heart** too.==
	- The heart is the seat of your emotions. But it is also so much more than that.
- The heart is your **core**.
	- It is closer to what we know as your ==soul/essence==.
	- Here, you will find the seat of **your values**...what we consider important.
		- We see its value in our mind, in our experiences.
- So pay attention to **time** and **circumstances**.
	- Your emotions could be ==possible reactions== to your values.
	- The ==tools== you need in discernment are the head and heart, which both have to work together. But ==factors we cannot control==, such as time and circumstances, bind our discernment.

**The General Structure of Discernment from** Pierre-Wolf's [[Sources/The Components of Any Choice]])
![[Extras/Media/Excalidraw/General Structure of Discernment.png]]


**Notes:**
- A question could be external, internal, or retrospective
- A decision is considered good if it enables you to live better
- Methodical work: the importance of paying attention to **data** (through journalling) and how it makes you **feel**
	- Wondering why certain events make you feel things points you to your values
- On faith's influence: We discern with our values, and faith (as a transcendent source) offers **a certain set of values** that we can use.
	- Faith shapes your values, which in turn shape your discernment.
	- How does this apply to a secular context?
		- Everyone believes that human beings have dignity.
		- Christians interpret this as God's love for us (see [[Sources/Being the Beloved]])
		- If you love from a point of abundance...it comes from knowing that you have always been loved.
		- On the other hand, if you love from a point of scarcity...you will always be treating your relationships transactionally
- Summary: LOOK -> FEEL -> PONDER


### Role of faith in discernment
- Theory: People aren't really angry at God; they're actually angry at **how it's presented to us**.
- Religion may be divinely inspired, but it is also **humanly constructed.** 
- 2 questions:
	- Is the way we live out our faith appropriate to the state of our life now? 
	- What image of God do we still hold today?
- 2 lessons about God from St. Thomas Aquinas (See [[Sources/The Flying Spaghetti Monster, Aristotle, and Fernando Amorsolo]]):
	- [[God is not a being]]
	- [[God is the condition of possibility that enables all other beings to exist]]
		- *Ipsum Esse Subsistens*: subsistent being itself.
		- Described as an **act**
- What we may often hear from loved ones: "I want what is best for you"
	- But how do we really know what's best for the one we love?
- Reality: We tend to impose our desire on the one we love.
	- Is that really what is best for them?
- **God does not impose his will**.
	- It's real love when you choose to commit...you're not forced to do it.
	- "The will of God"
	- **There's no blueprint.**
- Important thought: the will of God is not imposed on us from high above, but is often something we discover from **deep within**.
- So how can we perceive God's will? We need to examine our deepest life-giving **desires**. (Connected to [[Cards/Desire]])
	- If our life is a building...we can see desires as the raw material for discernment, and our head and heart as the tools we used to shape these desires.
	- When people say "This is God's plan for you", they're trying to perceive something we cannot. 
		- God is the epitome of a mystery. [[Cards/Problem versus Mystery]]
		- They're trying to cope with the chaos of life by assuming order. [[Cards/Order and Chaos]]
		- This shows an absolutely certain mindset; it's better to approach God from a place of wonder. [[Cards/Absolute Certainty versus Wonder]]

### Good & Evil
- Good and evil are typically assumed to be 2 equal and opposing forces.
	- [[Cards/Absolute Certainty versus Wonder]] minset
- However, according to St. [[Thomas Aquinas]], it doesn't work that way. He believed that **all there is good**. 
	- Allows for complementarities; see [[Sources/The Need for Certainty]] and [[Cards/Order and Chaos]]
- In line with this, his definition of evil was the **"privation of the good"**. (Remember: [[Evil is the privation of the good]])
	- It can be seen as an incomplete circle: a lack of what is supposed to be good
	- E.G. money being privatized so that others have a lack
- Thus, whenever we do evil, we actually see it as **good**, even if it's done in a mistaken way.
- Connected to [[Cards/Desire]]: The will **desires**. (e.g. "I will teach, study, etc."). But desire can lead us to evil, even if it appears good.
	- The will is **faculty** of desire.
- ^ Discernment helps us avoid this.
- A lack of good = a lack of ==energy/willpower.==
	- One of the things that reinforces laziness is when you overthink about it.
- If you pay attention to your good desires, how can they be opposed to God?
	- Just because it came from you doesn't mean it's against God

### Ignatian Discernment
- St. [[Ignatius of Loyola]] perceived discernment as **the ability to see God's will in one's life**.
- So if God's will is perceived through our deepest life-giving desires...
	- This refers to our **holy** desires
		- Does not mean "pious and out of this world"
		- Holy comes from the word whole
		- Thus, ==holy desires are the ones that make us whole==
- **[[Ignatian Spirituality]]:** a spirituality of desire. (See [[Cards/Desire]])
	- St. [[Ignatius of Loyola]] believed -- and this belief lies at the heart of [[Ignatian Spirituality]] -- that **our truest desires reflect God's desires in us and for us**.
- We need to distinguish our **surface wants** from our **deep desires**.
	- This can be difficult though...like distinguishing M&M's and Skittles, or distinguishing water and vodka.
- We need to learn how to **test** our desires. This is exactly what discernment is for: to test which of our desires are authentically good, and which ones are only apprently good.
	- Urges are on the ==physical level== (reactive/surface, while desires are deeper , being on the ==realm of value==
| Surface Wants                                    | Deep Desires                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| My desire leads me to become selfish             | My desire leads me to a healthier self              |
| My desires disenages me from the needs of others | My desire enables me to be more available to others |
| My desire is governed by fear                    | My desire is driven by love                                                    |

- St. [[Ignatius of Loyola]]'s greatest contribution: **[[Sources/The Spiritual Exercises]]**
	- Full form: 30-day retreat where you give yourself to God
	- Begins with [[Cards/The First Principle and Foundation]], where you **articulate the ultimate goal of your life**

![[Sources/The Spiritual Exercises#Annotation 23]]

- Remember: **Our deepest, most life-giivng desires are God's desires for us.**
	- St. Iraneus: *"[[Cards/Gloria dei vivens homo]]"* ("The glory of God is the human person fully alive.")

#### How do I know I'm on the right path in discernment?
- Ask yourself: Are you **at peace** with your decision?
	- What being at peace looks like: **a stability and sernity the comes from a sense of rightness**
		- Note: this does not use the word "happy"...
		- ...because sometimes we now that the right decision is also the difficult decision...
		- ...and that serenity and stability don't come right away
	- The goal of discernment is **peace**.
- So how can you tell if you're at peace? Through 2 movements in discernment: [[Cards/Consolation]] and [[Cards/Desolation]]
- **Important notes:** ^6b4c48
	- [[Cards/Consolation]] and [[Cards/Desolation]] are **interior movements**. They are felt, but they are more than just emotions.
	- Sometimes the **right decision** can be accompanied by initial feelings of **sadness** and **doubt**, and **the wrong decision** may start with feelings of **happiness** and **clarity**.
		- Thus, it is important to pay attention to the ==long-term trajectory==

#### Indifference
- In the Ignatian sense, **indifference** means looking at your decisions from a fresh and balanced perspective
	- Balacing [[Cards/Order and Chaos]]
- **Ignatian Indifference:** **maintaining a vision** of the whole
	- Settling one's life in balance before all created things
	- Note: the heart of our attachments is a distinct [[Cards/Brokenness]] in our character
- There is indeed a difference between happiness and joy.

| Happiness                                                                                                                                       | Joy                                                         |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| It is an emotional state (therefore fleeting). It relies on one or more multiple things and times. It does not need to have any deeper meaning. | An abiding sense of peace that one's life is **meaningful** |

- **Happiness**
	- Happiness is **monetary bliss**.
	- Take for instance, **The Wheel of Fortune**. This image is used to describe life (as full of up and down days). It shows us that you can easily lose the things that make you happy. ![[Extras/Media/Images/The Wheel of Fortune.png]]
		-  Happiness: ==living your life on the edge of the wheel== (at its most unstable)
	- The things that can make us happy can also make us miserable too.
		- RECALL: Attachment and [[Cards/Desolation]]
		- This can be seen in the temptation to overwork during your early 20's. Remember that there's more to life than your job.
			- This is why it is important to have a holistic view of what makes your life meaningful.
	- Isn't it strange that those whose who have everything are not necessarily happy?
		- Takeaway: It's possible to life a "happy" life that is ==meaningless.==
- **Joy**
	- Joy can happen even amid the ==absence of happiness== and the ==presence of sorrow.==
		- RECALL: Detachment and [[Cards/Consolation]]
	- While happiness is a fleeting emotion, joy is a stable state.
		- Remember: *[[Cards/Gloria dei vivens homo]]*
	- **Live your life at the center of the wheel rather than its edges.**
		- Counterpoint to the Wheel of Fortune: The **Rose Window**, which places Jesus at the center ![[Extras/Media/Images/Rose Window.png]]
		- "Discard everything that does not spark joy"
	- Good discernment leads to a life of joy.
