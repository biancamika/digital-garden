## Notes
- Definition: The power relationship between the encroachers and the authorities
- For many of these disenfranchised, the streets are the main, perhaps the only, place where they can perform their daily functions – to assemble, make friends, earn a living, spend their leisure time and express discontent. 
- Streets are also the public places where the state has the most evident presence, which is expressed in police patrol, traffic regulations and spatial divisions – in short, public ordering.
- Two key factors render the streets an arena of politics.
	- First is the use of public space as a ==site of contestation== between the actors and the authorities.
	- The second element shaping street politics is the ==operation of a passive network== among the people who use and operate in the public space – an instantaneous communication among atomised individuals which is established by a tacit recognition of their common identity, and which is mediated through space.
