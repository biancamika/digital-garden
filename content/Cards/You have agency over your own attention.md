## Notes
- See [[Cards/Waldenponding]] and [[Miscellaneous Notes/Literature Notes/Breaking Smart - Literature Notes]]
- E.G. ad blockers, cogntive frames
	- Therefore, if you think your attention is getting "hacked", it's because you're allowing it


> you aren't an NPC -- non-playing/playable character -- in the battle for your own attention. You have tools ranging from ad blockers to cognitive reframes. If you're letting your attention get "hacked", it's because you're choosing to. ==If you think the only kind of agency you have is the agency to uncritically withdraw to save your soul, you've been pwned, but it isn't by the tech platforms.==
