## Notes
### Defining modernism
- The modern condition is characterized by a struggle of **being** as a ==process against all the external and internal forces against us==
	- The tensions of the modernist: **external forces that impact the self** (e.g. social expectations, nature, what people say about us, what people say we should do, events like political issues, national elections, and war)
	- The self also clashes with the self (a.k.a. the unconscious/psyche)

- Modernism is not about a certain time period; instead, it's about ==a way of perceiving, a way of being, a way of thinking about the **self**.==
- 2 ways of perceiving the self: [[Romanticism]] v.s. Modernism
	- Romanticism: the reality & identity are **external**
		- E.G. Keats' poem, which exhibits aspiration
	- Modernism: the reality & identity are **internal**
		- E.G. Shakespheare's poem, which exhibits inevitability
- One takeaway: despite knowing that life is finite, ==the process of *truly* be-ing itself seems to be what life is all about==

- Related concepts to the modern:
	- **Identity**
		- Existence of stable, coherent “self”, independent of culture and society.  
		- Identity is static: one either _is_ one's racial, ethnic, national or gender identity (the traditional view) or ==one has an innate identity which should be separated from social influences== (Rousseau's romantic view).
	- **Absurdity**
		- Albert Camus defines the absurd as ==the tension created by humanity's need for meaning and the universe's refusal to provide any.== We can find no evidence for the existence of God, so all we are left with is an indifferent universe where bad things happen without a higher purpose or justification.
		- Absurd literary works **present** and **explore** the absurd nature of existence. They took a good look at the fact that ==there is no inherent meaning in life, yet we keep on living and keep trying to find meaning.== This was achieved by being themselves absurd in form or plot or both.
	- **Fragmentation**
		- Modernist literature embraces fragmentation as a literary form, since it reinforces the ==fragmentation of reality and contradicts notions of totality and wholeness.==
	- **Alienation**
		- The basic form of ==rootlessness==
		- Result of ==loss of identity==, which emerges as natural consequences of ==existential predictament==
		- The dispossessed personality's search for identity is a common place theme in modern fiction. Man fails to perceive today the very purpose behind life and the relevance of his existence in a hostile world.

### Freud and Jung on the psyche

- The **internal life** is the cardinal element of the modernist sensibility. However, what is internal is shadowy, difficuult to define, and hard to understand.
- Freud
	- human tendency towards violence and sex
	- Id, ego, superego
	- The Oedipal complex
	- Growing up is working through these aspects of the self, and silencing the more difficult parts...
		- But the unconscious always finds a way to come out           
- Before Freud & Jung, no one had a way to study the mind (thus mental illness wsn't a concept back then). But thanks to their work, it became ==impossible to think of the human being as 'whole'==
- Jung: ==we are 'enigmas' to ourselves==; our lack of knowledge leads us to a state of conflict

- "Modern society": defined by state/collective action/generalities
	- The problem of bein an indivdual in this type of society, according to Jung, is ==society only cares for what is external.== This leads to psyche being ignored, causing many mental health and behaivoral issues.
