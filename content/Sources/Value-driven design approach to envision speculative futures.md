## Highlights
- Process:
	- Emotion-based design ethnography
		- Methods: Interviews, mobile diaries, online survey
		- keywords from emotion wheel help individuals to cognitively recognize and verbalize their own emotions, guiding them to pick up on situations, actions, and environments that prompted these emotions
	- visual mapping and value-extraction
		- Then insights are mapped through coding, mapping, and thematic analysis of stories collected from in-depth interviews
	- secondary research of technology and socio-cultural trends and filtering of technologies based on its interpreted value-experiences
		- collected examples of emerging technologies, products, services, and societal trends that could indicate possible signals of change in the future (In parallel to user research activities)
		- Following the collection phase, we placed a ‘value-filter’ over these examples, where we used the four clusters of twelve values to categorize technologies, signals, and trends. Each one of them were further tagged with value-experiences to highlight how the features and key ideas behind the selected product/technology/trends can be positioned to deliver the tagged value-experiences
	- design of value-driven future scenarios
		- Four design visions of possible futures were developed during this step through an iterative conceptualization process of consolidating the values, experiences, signals and trends.
	- materializing scenarios as discursive prototypes
		- first type
			- prototyping of the design visions into a tangible format that can be experienced and shared with others for provocation, debate and discussion.
			- Storytelling narratives, objects, or both
			- Unlike traditional design artefacts, in which messages are made as clear as possible to enable users to think less, discursive design artefacts attempt to do the opposite. To invite the viewer to apply their personal interpretations, discursive prototypes (scenarios) are intentionally designed to be “open- ended, unclear, and complicated, and strive to provoke discussion” (Tharp & Tharp, 2013).
		- second type: exhibition design
			- Messaging is obvious
			- Think about how this can be done in website form
- Can supplement the UrbanIXD paper
- Instead of mapping based on emotions and values…what if I try this with the concepts from the HCE toolkit?
