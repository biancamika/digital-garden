## Notes
### Egypt
- We've often used gold to revere the things we've found most sacred (e.g. royalty)
- We first fell in love with gold because of how it looked...it reminded us of **the sun**
	- The ancients believed that ==gold and the sun were one and the same==, so only that color was worthy of honoring the sun
	- Example: sun chariot
		- The creators of this perceived the sun as a great, golden goddess that was being carried by this divine horse every day
		- They also probably pulled this chariot back and forth to teach people the importance of the sun
		- 3,500 years later, everything else deteriorated, but the gold is still shining
- Ancient Egyptians had tons of access to gold because of their **territory**, which was blessed with seemingly unlimited reserves of gold
	- They were also good at extracting this gold; there were huge teams of men working all day bringing this gold out
	- As a result, Egypt quickly became ==the world's first great gold-producing state.==
	- The goldsmiths were truly revered in Egypt, as exemplified by the tomb of the grand vizier Mereruka. He was entrusted with the production and protection of Egypt's gold. So carved into the walls of his tomb are depictions of his invaluable work...particularly **the entire gold-making process**
		- 1st step: weighing of gold
			- Even if gold was abundant, it was still valuable to the point that nothing was unaccounted for
		- Remarkable hieroglyphs:
			- A master telling his slave to get his ass moving
			- All four goldsmiths are ==dwarfs==; dwarfs are depicted as gold workers because they were actually perceived by ancient Egyptians as possessing ==magical powers.==
- Most of the gold smiths' creations were hidden away from view and/or stolen...until **archaeologist Howard Carter** came along. He broke into the tomb of **Tutankhamen** and found all his treasures
	- The most astounding treasure found here was the death mask of Tutankhamen: 11kg solid gold, bejwelled, exquisitely crafted.
		- Tender: big ears, fleshy lips, wide innocent eyes to make the face come to life
	- Why was everything in gold? This isn't a statement of wealth...rather it shows how people believed that **gold had magical powers**
		- Same color as the sun; never tarnishes
		- Perhaps Tut was hoping the magic would rub off on him
### Rome
- Pagan gods were banished and replaced with a single creator -- the Christian God. This is all thanks to Emperor Constantine
	- The one new idea of Christianity: **distaste for wealth, extravagance, ostentatious display**
	- This led to gold, a modern luxury, no longer being worshipped
- But gold made a comeback thanks to a new artform: **Byzantine art**
	- Why was gold deemed appropriate in this context? Here, it represents not material things, but ==immaterial things.== Perhaps it's suited to portray God, the most immaterial of them all
	- The backgrounds of icons are generally gold. They represent the ==all-pervading presence of God.== It reflects light, it gives light. It's radiant with God.
		- The reflective qualities of light show how a life with God is dynamic, not static. Color is transformed from murky brown to shimmering yellow
		- Gold became the color of the light of God
- In the 6th century AD, **Byzantine Emperor Justinian** built the **basilica** of **San Vitale** in Ravenna
	- Showcases one of the greatest inventions of the Byzantine age: **gold tesseras.** These are individual tiles (often squares) that are used to ==create mosaics.==
	- They trap all of the light in this church, and then the glass like a lens amplifies that light.
		- The light is not blinding like electricity; it sparkles, glimmers, and glistens
		- Must've felt like looking into heaven
- The early Christians who had once renounced all things golden, had, like the ancients before them, used the colour ingeniously to bring themselves closer to their God.
### Renaissance
- Heaven seemed to lose its monopoly on gold...and gold would become a potent force in more ==worldly affairs.==
- Now gold was used to satisfy the vanity of kings, queens, and their courts
	- E.G. **Queen Elizabeth I** giving out **solid gold cameos** with her face to her most trusted courtiers
- So while it's gold, it's no longer really about the sacred. What it's really about is **power, politics and, above all, status.**
	- Kings and queens looked for the best goldsmiths to outshine their rivals
- **Ponte Vecchio in Florence:** one of the great centres of gold work. People would sell their wares here. But the goldsmith most sought after was **Benvenuto Cellini.**
	- the only goldsmith to get a statue.
	- Cellini was fastidious in recording his many ingenious techniques
	- Cellini's legacy lives on at the studio of **Paolo Penko**, a Florentine goldsmith who's been following Cellini ever since he was little
	- Cellini was a troublemaker; he was charged with various crimes. But **King Francis I of France** was willing to forgive him of everything in order to make his kingdom the center of the renaissance
		- He commissioned Cellini to make a solid gold salt cellar. Cellini ended up taking over 3 years on this project, but it became the masterpiece that defined his career
			- 2 gods: Neptune (sea) and Terra (land)
			- Salt was an incredibly important substance in the 16th century (made up much of King Francis' revenue), which is why it was worth putting in gold
- **Augustus the Strong** was a ruler whose lust for gold was so strong...he would've stolen this cellar
	- Favorite sport: fox tossing
	- Depicted in a statue known as The Golden Rider
	- His desire was to be seen as one of the great rulers of European history, and the secret to achieving that ambition was gold.
	- He had a dream of unlimited gold...which led him to **Friedrich Bottger**, a 19-year-old alchemist who seemingly achieved the miracle of transmutation,
		- Freidrich was imprisoned by Augustus. He couldn't produce gold, of course...but he was able to produce a ==golden sun mask==, which was modelled on Augustus' features
		- It was made of copper, with a bit of gold put on top of it
			- It embodies that desperate desire of Augustus to enter the pantheon of the great gods and the great kings, but also shows how he wasn't powerful and rich enough to become one of them
- **George Richards Elkington** was a step closer to this dream though...he patented a way to make gold objects out of almost nothing. This was a process called **electro-plating:** ==harnessing electricity to make gold objects.==
	- Prince Albert visited and was captivated by this...he then asked to have his own electro-plating suite
	- People liked electro-plating because it was cheap. It doesn't really produce solid gold. All it does is produce a color. Hence why it can be called ==Elkington's fool's gold==
	- This innovation allowed the public to own their very own piece of gold, even if it wasn't pure. ==It democratized gold==
- **Gustav Klimt's** The Kiss
	- almost every single kind of golden substance was thrown on this canvas (e.g. eight different kinds of gold leaf alone)
	- Why so much gold? This could be seen as part of his desperate attempt to ==bring back gold from the brink. ==
		- He has lived through a period when gold has become debased, cheap, and tacky (thanks to democratization)
		- He's trying to say, "No, gold is the most precious thing we have. It's the most numinous, spiritual, other-worldly thing we have and therefore we have to devote it to the most important things in the world"...which was **love**
		- Ironic how his work has been endlessly reproduced now

## Cues

	- Sun god
	- Doesn't tarnish

## Summary
- We're so obsessed with gold because gold reflects the things that every society holds **most sacred.**
	- Ancient Egyptians: the sun and the afterlife
	- The Christians: the light of God
	- The Renaissance Kings: power and status
	- Gustav Klimt: love and sex
	- Bank of England: money
