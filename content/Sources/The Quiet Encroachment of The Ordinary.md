## Highlights
- [[Quiet encroachment]] is **the silent, protracted but pervasive ==advancement of the ordinary people on the propertied and powerful== in order to ==survive and improve== their lives.** 
- Marked by ==quiet, largely atomised and prolonged mobilization== with ==episodic collective action== – open and fleeting struggles without clear leadership, ideology or structured organisation.
- These actors do not carry out their activities as a deliberate political act; rather, they are driven by the ==force of necessity== – the necessity to survive and improve their lives.
	- Necessity is the notion that justifies their often unlawful acts as moral and even “natural” ways to maintain a life with dignity.
- A key attribute of the quiet encroachment is that while advances are made quietly, individually and gradually, ==the defence of their gains are often, although not always, collective and audible.==
	- Driven by force of necessity, they set out their ventures individually…(every man for himself mentality)
	- Yet as these seemingly desperate individuals and families pursue similar paths, their sheer cumulative scores eventually turn them into a ==social force.==
- Why individual, quiet and direct action, instead of collective demand-making?
	- Unlike the factory workers, students or professionals (i.e. groups that could be represented by unions), these people represent groups in flux, ==operating largely outside institutional mechanisms through which they could express grievance and enforce demands.== They lack an organisational power of disruption.
	- Mobilisation for collective demand-making is prevented by political repression in many developing countries where these struggles often take place. Consequently, in place of protest or publicity, these groups move directly to fulfil their needs by themselves, albeit individually and discretely
	- theirs is not a politics of protest, but of ==redress== – a struggle for an immediate outcome through individual direct action.
- What do these men and women aim for? They seem to pursue two major goals.
	- The ==redistribution of social goods and opportunities== in the form of the (unlawful and direct) acquisition of collective consumption (land, shelter, piped water, electricity, roads), public space (street pavements, intersections, street parking places), opportunities (favourable business conditions, locations, labels, licenses), and other life chances essential for survival and acceptable standards.
		- Basically socialism lol
	- The other goal is ==attaining autonomy==, both cultural and political, from the regulations, institutions and discipline imposed by the state and modern institutions.
		- Not only do the poor seek autonomy, they also need security from state surveillance because ==an informal life in the conditions of modernity is also an insecure life.== 
### Becoming Political
- The states’ position vis-à-vis this type of activism is affected…
	- first, by the extent of their capacity to exercise surveillance, 
	- second, by the dual nature of the quiet encroachment (infringing on property, power and privilege, and, simultaneously, being a self-help activity)
- The sources of conflict between the actors and the state are not difficult to determine.
	- First, the distribution of public goods free-of-charge exerts heavy pressure on the resources which the state controls. 
	- Secondly, the quest for autonomy in everyday life creates a serious void in the domination of the modern state.
		- Moreover, autonomy and informality (of agents, activities, and spaces) deprive the states of the necessary knowledge to exert surveillance.
- The ==streets serve as the only locus of collective expression== for, but by no means limited to, those who generally lack an institutional setting to express discontent
	- For many of these disenfranchised, the streets are the main, perhaps the only, place ==where they can perform their daily functions== – to assemble, make friends, earn a living, spend their leisure time and express discontent. 
	- Streets are also the public places w==here the state has the most evident presence==, which is expressed in police patrol, traffic regulations and spatial divisions – in short, public ordering.
	- The power relationship between the encroachers and the authorities is what I have termed “[[Street politics]].”
		- Two key factors render the streets an arena of politics.
			- First is the use of public space as a ==site of contestation== between the actors and the authorities.
			- The second element shaping street politics is the ==operation of a passive network== among the people who use and operate in the public space – an instantaneous communication among atomised individuals which is established by a tacit recognition of their common identity, and which is mediated through space.
