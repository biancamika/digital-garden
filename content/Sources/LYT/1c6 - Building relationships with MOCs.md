title: "1c6 - Building relationships with MOCs"
---
An MOC is just a note — a very special type of note.   
  
It has properties of folders and tags, while effectively leveraging proximity.
- **Folder-like:** MOCs assemble notes in a tightly-packed grouping.
- **Tag-like:** MOCs group the links of associated notes in a non-exclusive way. (The notes themselves live freely elsewhere.)
- **Proximity:** MOCs grant you the ability to deliberately position each note in relation to the other notes.

> In this way, MOCs don’t limit access, they **curate** it — while keeping your notes free.

## Analogies for MOCs
- Using MOCs is like ==having your own warehouse full of workbenches==, where each workbench contains a selection of highly curated index cards for you to engage with.
- In an MOC, the party is always happening. It’s the ==“room where it happens.” ==
    - The notes linked inside an MOC have basically “shadow-cloned” themselves—meaning they can essentially be in multiple parties simultaneous—interacting and developing complexity from each party at the same time!
- MOCs are sometimes just really mature evergreen notes.

**_Q: How do MOCs (Maps of Content) compare to TOCs (Table of Contents)?_**  
A: Whereas MOCs are ==fluid==, TOCs are ==rigid.== This is by design. A table of contents is for assembling something into a specific and linear order. MOCs serve much broader purposes. Oftentimes an MOC can morph into a TOC as a project starts to finalize.
