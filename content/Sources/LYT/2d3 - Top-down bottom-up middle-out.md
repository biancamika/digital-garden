title: "2d3 - Top-down bottom-up middle-out"
---
- **Bottom-up:** start with atomic notes
- **Top-down:** start with structure, like folders or MOCs
- **Middle-out:** happens when we're spending our time in Emergence Level 3, where higher notes like MOCs are being assembled, collided, and unified
	- Unifying Phase:
		- merge/unify, navigate, reference
		- what emerges is a valuable grouping of ideas.
		- 2 obvious benefits: it can be used to navigate your notes and to create a final product
	- Colliding Phase:
		- interact, exchange, collide
		- thought collisions produce insights. colliding ideas in higher order notes can raise our thinking abilities to another level. this is what we mean by "next level thinking"
	- Assembling Phase:
		- gather, assemble, incubate
		- it's helpful to get a higher level perspective on your notes. any note about notes is a higher order note. it will mainly have links to other notes.
- ^ You can rapidly switch between top-down and bottom-up in middle-out
