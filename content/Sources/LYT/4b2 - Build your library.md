title: "4b2 - Build your library"
---
- After making many MOCs, we start to desire a place to easily access them.  
- We can accomplish this with two complementary notes:
	- A **library**: This can be a time-tested pre-built solution.
	- A **home**: This will be your own custom solution.
- While I encourage you to fully customize your **home** note, you may want to start building your library with a pre-built system.  
- The **LYT Classification System** is lightly modified from the Cutter, Dewey, and Universal Decimal classification systems used in libraries around the world. It will provide you a time-tested foundation as you structure the interests of your digital library.

For many of you, this is a really satisfying exercise.  
  
_"Finally, a safe place to put all the things I'm interested in!"_  
  
If you find a topic that is important or interesting to you, you can easily create a placeholder MOC note now. Then it can effortlessly orbit in the background, allowing you add links to it (accreting over time), then eventually, maybe, the forces will align and you will finally dive into the topic and already have much to say about it.

Between the **library** and the **home** note, you will have two complementary ways to structure and navigate your accumulated knowledge. While the **library** is a reliable reminding note—and safety net—if you are like me, you will favor your **home** note. Let's build that in the next lesson.
