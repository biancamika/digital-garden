title: "2d1 - How folder-based PKM systems restrict your thinking"
---
- Before we completely dive into the fluid thinking that’s enabled by using LYT frameworks, it helps to gain perspective by considering where we are coming from.  **Folders.**  
	- Until recently, all we had were folders. So we would walk around in the world and bump into new data, new information, other people’s ideas. Some of it we decide to collect.   
	- But with only folders, we are forced into a premature question: _In which folder does this idea exclusively belong?_
- And we hit a wall.  The problem is, when we’re trying to work with knowledge, ==it’s a really fluid environment.== We don’t always know where something goes, _we don’t even know what something is yet_. ==So to put it into a rigid framework immediately restricts what it can become.==
	- This is the problem with folder-based PKM systems—they force you into ==top-down thinking.==
- In contrast to this, we’re going to continue exploring how the link-based **[[Cards/Idea Emergence]]** framework allows for a fluid method of thinking that ignores the premature "where do I have to put this" question.  
- You can still approach problems from a top-down style, but you won't be forced to.  You can just as easily start from the bottom-up or the middle-out. That's that power of ==[[Fluid Thinking]].==
