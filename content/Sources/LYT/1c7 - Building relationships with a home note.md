title: "1c7 - Building relationships with a home note"
---
- Think of your Home note as the ==highest-level of your digital notes.==   
- It has links to the main MOCs in your library along with your most relevant tags.  
- It is an excellent access point because it encourages you to ==focus on the areas in your life that you’ve deemed as important.==
---
- _Don't limit your relationship-building tools, ==use them more effectively.== _  
- _Until recently, folders were all we had. They weren’t good enough. Now we have links. Now many people have taken a hard stance that all they need are links. Hard stances become fragile stances. Don’t fall for the dogma. The right tools for a healthy digital library include a multitude of relationship-builders._
- _These relationship-builders include: a Home note. Maps of Content. Direct Links. Proximity. Tags. (Queries.)  And yes, even a few folders._
