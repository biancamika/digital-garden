title: "4b3 - Build your home"

When it comes to feeling grounded, it's just like what Dorothy said in The Wizard of Oz:   

> _"There’s no place like home."_

This is even truer in our digital spaces because it’s even easier to become lost...and confused...and overwhelmed.  
  
That's why your **home** note is your most important note, even if you don't always return to it. Your home note remains a reliable place to hold the most important landmarks in your knowledge management efforts.  
  
The home note isn't just a higher-order note; it's a time machine. It goes backwards and forwards...  
  
...giving you access to the past ⬅️  
...grounding you in the present ⬇️  
...launching you into the future ➡️  
  
Let's build your **home** note now...

It takes time to build your home note. Because building it makes us ask the big question:   

> _What is my relationship to knowledge?_
  
Hopefully, this lesson helped you clarify that ever-changing question.
