> **Structure must be earned!**

But since you weren't born yesterday, you might have a few ideas already. Just be careful not to over-structure too much too soon. So how should you add structure? In _tiny tests_. Tiny tests should:
- Be easy to undo.
- Take minimal effort to set up.

When you feel the urge to completely restructure.    
Pause.   
Take a deep breath.   
And figure out how to do a tiny test. Maybe it's trying out a new MOC or tag or folder. Maybe it's something else. Test it over a few weeks. Or months. See if it works. See how it feels. See if it scales. Give it some time.   
  
_Sometimes you might realize you actually don't need to add anything!_
