title: "3c3 - Use MOCs for building cognitive scaffolding"

- Why have we been building our **Concepts MOC** note? The main reason is so you start building meaningful **cognitive scaffolding** in your note-making space.  
- If you want to make leaps of insights and connect uncommon things, well, ==you first need things you can connect!  ==
- Cognitive scaffolding frees up our brains so we can think at the next level of complexity and make sense of bigger things. Cognitive scaffolding allows you to build on your prior knowledge, so your hard earned wisdom can reliably accrete for you.
