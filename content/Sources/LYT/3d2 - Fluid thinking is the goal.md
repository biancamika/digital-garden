title: "3d2 - Fluid thinking is the goal"

Now that we've had more practice, let's revisit [[Cards/Idea Emergence]] and the skill of [[Fluid Thinking]]"

--- 
**Fluid thinking** is the awareness and skill to think from the right level of abstraction at the right time.   
  

> Fluid thinking is your ability to deftly adjust your perspective, zooming out and in, bouncing up and down the levels of emergence, so you can approach a problem from the inside and the outside, tacking back and forth between those extremes. 

  
That opens up a lot a whole new ability to think fluidly and flexibly, and to accomplish a lot more in a lot less time, and have a lot more fun doing it.

- Sometime you start from the _top-down_: `Home » MOC » Note`
- Sometimes you start from the _middle-out_: `MOC » Note` & `MOC » Home`

[[Cards/Be water my friend]]. Don't limit yourself to one thinking style. Use all three.  
  
Fluid thinking is the goal.
