title: "3c1 - Use MOCs for developing your ideas"
---
- You can **use MOCs for developing your ideas**.   
- We just covered this intensely in section 3b. I used my Habits MOC as an example. You created your own MOC and we both went through the many moves of the map-maker. All of those moves happened in three basic, always-overlapping phases:
	- [[Sources/LYT/3b2 - The assembling phase]]
	- [[Sources/LYT/3b3 - The colliding phase]]
	- [[Sources/LYT/3b4 - The unifying phase]]
- Please quickly reflect on that experience before moving on to other ways to use MOCs.

- **Here is a quick reminder on how MOCs have become a new thinking tool for us.** Higher-order notes are a new thinking tool. We didn't have this ability before 2020. 
	- Sure, we could assemble links together in an outline. But we couldn't work with a multitude of complex and fluid ideas at the speed of thought. 
	- As a reminder, the reason we now can is largely because:
		- Fast notes, free notes, atomic notes, and especially linked notes (See [[Sources/LYT/1a1 - The age of the linked note|1a1 - The age of the linked note]])
		- Auto-updating note titles
- Those converging technological advances have created all sorts of unexpected second-order effects. One such second-order effect is the being able to use a higher-order note—an MOC—to take our ability to _gather, develop, and navigate_ ideas to another level.  
- _"gather, develop, and navigate ideas..."_ Practically, what does that look like?  
- That's what this section intends to show.  We can't show everything you can do with MOCs, but we will at least scratch the surface to help jump start your thinking around what is possible.
