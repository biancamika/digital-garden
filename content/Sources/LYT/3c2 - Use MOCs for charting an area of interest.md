title: "3c2 - Use MOCs for charting an area of interest"
---
- Topics are like cities. Spending time in a new topic is like spending time in a new city. If you have a good sense of the city, you will be able to navigate it much better.
- Here are the reasons to **use MOCs for charting an area of interest**.
	- It will help you understand the terrain of the topic. 
	- It will help you make sense of the material. 
	- It will help you navigate it effectively. 
	- And it will always be there for you, so years later you can return to it and already be jogging around.

> If you have a better map, you will make a better mark.
