title: "3b2 - The assembling phase"
---
- You walk around in the world. You encounter stuff. You want to do something with that stuff.  What does that look like in your note-making space?  
- You read something interesting on a topicâ€”let's say on "habits"â€”and you make a note. Later on, you make more notes on the same topic. "Hmm", you say, "I'm starting to worry I might lose some of these ideas." So to overcome thisÂ **mental squeeze point**, you deploy a new digital workbench and gather related notes. That workbench is an MOC.  
- Together, let's go through theÂ **assembly phase**.

## Exercise
- - ðŸ—º Review yourÂ **Concepts MOC**Â note.
    - Add 2-3 more things
    - Lightly shuffle your notes/ideas/thoughts around in a way that makes sense to you.
- ðŸ—º Create a new MOC on a personally meaningful topic. Go through theÂ **assembly phase**.
    - **_Collect_**Â your notes, ideas, and related thoughts into this MOC.
        - If your note-making space doesn't have many notes, this action will be more difficult, but you can still assemble ideas and thoughts.Â 
    - Lightly shuffle your notes/ideas/thoughts around in a way that makes sense to you.
