title: "3d1 - Five umbrella benefits of MOCs"
---
These are the 5 overlapping umbrella benefits of making and using MOCs:  
> Dependable â€” Flexible â€” Enhancing â€” Generating â€” Healthy

---
## Dependable
_You can find what you are looking for._
- Let's put it this way: even the credit agencies would be forced to give your notes a higher credit score
    - Â You will have better recall: You may not remember that guy's name in that song by itself, but when it's in a higher-order note, you exclaim "Jack and Diane!"
    - Â You will have more methods to retrieval.
    - Â The methods of retrieval build overlapping redundancies.
    - Â You will have future-proofed knowledge. ðŸ—¿
- You will be able to better manage stress and anxiety.
    - Â You will have less overwhelm and be able to get pastÂ **mental squeeze points**.

## Flexible
_You can use MOCs in several different ways._
- You can organize.
- You can create.
- You can navigate.
- You have the option to NOT use them, and your notes still function.
    - Your MOCs are non-destructive and non-limiting because they act as a fluid layer.

## Enhancing
_Your thinking becomes "next level"._
- _Heightened thinking_Â - You can deal with many complex concepts at the same time that can often overwhelm a person without an MOC.
    - Â You will be able to think at a higher, more complex level. If Ideation was regulated, MOCs would be considered PEDs (Performance Enhancing Drugs).
- _Relational thinking_Â - You build awareness and possibly even EQ (Emotional Intelligence). You will train yourself to think relationally: "How does this relate?"
    - Â You will start to spot digestible bits of information and how they can connect to your digital library.
- _Sustainable thinking_Â - You can reliably "pick up from where you left off".
- _Fluid thinking_Â - You can easily move between the levels of Idea Emergence.
- _Next level thinking_: You maximize the time working at higher levels of sophistication, importance, creativity, or prominence.

## Generative
_You develop ideas and generate value (both internal and external)._
- You are encouraged to develop ideas.
    - This is what happens when notes are placed in a room together and forced to figure things out.Â 
- You are basicallyÂ _forced_Â to accelerate your ideation: your sensemaking, taste-making, and match-making (See [[Cards/Three ways the map-maker creates value]])
- You naturally make new creations that are already prepped for the final steps.
- You naturally create helpful summations of thought (artifacts) on a topic that act as a reliable reminding tool.
- MOCs remain ready to grow with more ideas, take on more links, and compound in value over time.Â 
    - Â Since MOCs are adjustable and moldable, they easily evolve as your thoughts grow, mature, and develop complexity on a subject.

## Healthy
_You maintain a positive relationship with your knowledge management._
- Your management of knowledge becomes enjoyable, which creates a positive feedback loop where you feel rewarded for returning to your knowledge library.Â 
- Your brain's attentional filter is controlled by two factors: Novelty and Importance. Working in an MOC naturally provides both (More on this in Unit 4).
- You easily control the "Flow spigot" with Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (More on this in Unit 4).
