title: "1b6 - Defining fluid frameworks"
---
- **Fluid frameworks** are ==non-rigid, highly-flexible organizing structures== that you can use as needed.  
	- Within the LYT frameworks, we are mainly referring to higher-order notes like MOCs.  
  - **_Fluid frameworks are not mutually exclusive_**. 
	  - That means a note with its link in an MOC, doesn't exclusively live in the MOC note. 
	  - A note can ==live and link freely.== A note can be ==discovered in as many places as it's referenced.== These are the fundamentals of linking notes together. 
	  - But now with higher-order notes like MOCs, we can fluidly add any structure, at any time.
- Let's quickly define "fluid frameworks" by looking at MOCs:
	1. **Non-destructive**: The notes that are linked within are not affected.  
	2. **Non-exclusive**: MOCs don't limit discoverability  
	3. **Non-limiting**: You can create countless variations of structure.  
	4. **Co-existing**: MOCs don't impede other MOCs.  
	5. **Heterarchical**: There is no hard-coded, rigid top-down structure.  
	6. **Overlapping**: MOCs can link to the same notes, no big deal.  
	7. **Augment-able**: MOCs can quickly augment the view of your library.  
	8. **Neighborly**: MOCs stay out of the way, unless you need them.  
	9. **Delete-able**: You can delete MOCs and your notes remain unaltered (unlike folders).
	10. **Fluid**: Like water, MOCs can form to the changing shape of your needs
- Let's define this another way: "**Fluid frameworks** are _non-essential supporting structures_."
	- Whereas, a typical framework—like a folder—is an ==essential supporting structure.== If you delete the folder, and you delete the files within. That's because folders are not fluid; they are a ==rigid framework.==
	- Folders reduce the number of ways you have to access the notes trapped within. Now it's worth noting, we do have "global search", and we can link to notes within folders...so that's better than it used to be...but there is still no removing the friction that comes from having to twirl down folders 📂 X, 📂 Y, and 📂 Z, just to _maybe_ get to  📝 Idea Omega.  
	- So even though folders alone are rigid, if you expertly use fluid frameworks—i.e. "**_higher-order notes_**"—to support your linked knowledge, then you can also work back in some smart applications of folders.  
	- That's why we're here: to become skilled and confident with how we are deploying the tools that we have to structure our notes in the best way possible.
