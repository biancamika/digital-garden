- **Direct links** are the strongest type of relationship.  
- They are the purest and most explicit way of connecting two notes.  
- This is the core method of growing a healthy, dynamic zettelkasten.
- **Pros**
	- A flat structure of notes — i.e. one big folder — is “frictionless”. There is no thinking “now where exactly does this go?” 
	- Links force you to focus on "relevance". Links encourage lateral thinking and the generation of unexpected insights.
- **Cons**
	- Using _only_ links can lead to a messy, overwhelming, and claustrophobic note library.
- Despite the proclamations during the "Great Folder Rebellion", direct links alone are not enough.  
- They do not allow for easy, dependable high-level navigation.  
- Remember the graphic showcasing **[[Cards/Idea Emergence]]**? Direct links only keep you at ==eye-level in the dense forest (Emergence Level 2)==, but many times you want to zoom out and view the map. That is where higher-order notes (like MOCs) will help.
