title: "3b4 - The unifying phase"
---
- In the third phase of MOCs, we unify it with the rest of your note library.  
- As you finish work on an area of interest, the MOC remains as a renewable summation of thought for Future You. An MOC is your easy access point back into the topicâ€”whether that's tomorrow or in ten years.
- You can use your more mature MOCs for different purposes:
	- for the formation of final products (content creation)
	- as a reference point in the future to remind and guide you
	- as a navigational hub to fly around your notes
	- or for the inherent joy the ideas provide
- Enjoy the spatial constellation you created. It's most likely meaningful to you.
## Exercise
- ðŸ—º In your new MOC, go through theÂ **unifying phase**.Â 
    - **_Connect_**Â your MOC to another MOC.
        - If your note-making space is new, you can always just connect it to a placeholder note calledÂ **The MOC Library**, which we will create in Unit 4.
