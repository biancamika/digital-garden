title: "4c1 - Develop your PKM folders"
---
In this section, we dive deeply into _folders, tags, metadata, and queries_.  
As a reminder, we looked at three of these PKM relationship-builders in Unit 1:
- [[Sources/LYT/1c3 - Building relationships with folders|1c3 - Building relationships with folders]]
- [[Sources/LYT/1c4 - Building relationships with tags|1c4 - Building relationships with tags]]
- [[Sources/LYT/1c5 - Building relationships with proximity|1c5 - Building relationships with proximity]]

Now let's explore _folders_ more deeply. Copy and paste the following into the note you created in 1c.3 called **My PKM Folders**.
```
A folder for daily notes
Folders for projects
Folder for an inbox (or seedbox)
Folders for special files
Folders for “very clearly defined” types of notes
Folders for your sources
Folders for your MOCs and datascopes
Folders to clearly define what you share with others
Folders for private notes
```
