- No matter what product or service you sell, you also sell an experience—and ==branding is what creates this experience.== Think of this as ==the sum of all the touchpoints between your company and its customers.==
- Consider how people share photos of their Starbucks drinks on social media. Starbucks doesn’t only sell coffee; it sells a trendy self-image. People order from Starbucks to project this identity, even if its coffee isn’t the best. In fact, in a [blind taste test by Consumer Reports magazine](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2009/06/could-mcdonalds-really-beat-starbucks/18956/), McDonald’s coffee beat Starbucks—but that doesn’t stop Starbucks from being the most popular coffee chain in the world.
- Building a brand is ultimately about ==shaping perceptions of your company’s value.==
- With a poor brand, customers won’t want any affiliation with your company. They might see your product as not being worth their money, or worse, a scam. But done well, good branding does the opposite—it makes your product desirable, with customers naturally spreading the word and even lining up for more from your business.
- Our [[Five Fits Framework]] includes brand because it plays a crucial role in determining your ideal growth strategy as well as your overall growth potential. Brand guides how you convey your company to the world and much more, like:
	-   How you should build your product
	-   Which pricing model(s) are optimal
	-   Which growth channels you should (and shouldn’t) use
- **In other words, brand touches every aspect of your growth engine.**
- In this unit, we’ll explain why brand is a secret weapon for growth. You’ll learn about the key components of a successful brand strategy and how to define your own brand for stand-out results.
