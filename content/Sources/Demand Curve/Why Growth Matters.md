title: "Why Growth Matters"

[[Atlas/Maps/Demand Curve Growth MOC]]
- There's a commonly held belief among founders that the number one cause of startup failure is a poor product.  But there's another reason that doesn't get as much attention. Peter Thiel says it well: _“Most businesses actually get zero distribution channels to work. ==Poor distribution== — not product — is the number one cause of failure.”_
- Failory, a company that studies why businesses failed, reports the following:
	- ![[Extras/Media/Images/Common Reasons for Startup Failure.png]]
	- Their study concluded: "**Marketing** **mistakes** were by far the most common [type], and they were generally speaking the most deadly with 69% of all mentioned marketing mistakes being fatal."
	- Marketing is often at the root of startup failures.
- Our method puts **the market** **first**. You aren't trying to _find_ a market for your product; ==you're trying to _build_ a product for a specific market.==
- But there's another important framing that makes it even more apparent how critical marketing is to getting traction. When we read the studies above, it's easy to assume that the startup _did_ in fact get their product in the hands of the _right_ market. 
	- But what if the startup doesn't have a clear understanding of their market in the first place? 
	- Or what if they know their market, but they're struggling to leverage marketing channels to reach the right customers?
- **This program focuses on helping startups acquire customers and think more strategically about growth. You'll write landing pages, design ads, launch channels, etc. But more importantly, we'll help you approach your market in a holistic, validated way.**
