## Notes
- Shelley: "We are all Greeks"...laws, literature, religion, and the arts all have their roots in Greek culture
- The human form and mind attain to a perfection in Greece
- In the 18th and 19th centuries: Europeans created personal museums for idealizing values like reason, liberty, and justice. To do this, they surrounded themselves with Greek and Roman art
	- The founding fathers of America were looking for a visual style that would embody their democratic ideals (harmony, order, and freedom), which they were able to find in Greece and Rome
- The Athenians are often portrayed as superheroes, the creators of  democracy/perfect society
	- We must be careful not to idolize them though, because their societies were far from perfect. Women had no rights, imperialism was rampant, etc.
	- Greek artists understood these dark aspects of human nature, so they made their creations about these contradictions, about the tragedies and the failures, as well as the achievements
- Greek art has been broken and dismantled by time, so we must use a lot of our imagination to visualize what these works were like originally
	- Statues were painted; they weren't originally white
- Another important characteristic of Greek art: extremely rapid development of the style. 
	- Realistic, formal, stiff
- The Greeks lived in small city states near to the sea. This made them vulnerable to attacks from larger forces, but also made them rely on their resources of fitness, strength, etc...overall individual heroism
	- The idea of the individual, standing proudly independent, is one of the most resilient ideas in human history
- Greek statues
	- So how do statues embody early Greek culture? 4 reasons:
		- No clothes: the figure is free and proud
		- No back pillar and screen: the figure is autonomous
		- the figure is beautiful
		- the figure is youthful (18-21 years)
	- They could serve 2 functions:
		- offered to the gods (particularly to Apollo)
		- stand above a grave, reminding his descendants of the deceased's prime
- These statues had a female equivalent in Kore
	- Serene instead of heroic. 
	- She is clothed and static.

## Cues
- reason, liberty, and justice; harmony, order, and freedom
