## Notes
Your **fourth required reading** discusses **attachment**, which is a serious obstacle from good discernment, and how to counter it with **detachment**.

Margaret's book _Inner Compass: An Invitation to Ignatian Spirituality_ deals, among other things, with the issue of attachments and learning how to detach from them in order for one to make a sound discernment.

### Reflection Questions
-   **Why does Silf call attachment as "being hooked?" What does being "hooked" do to a person?**
	- Being hooked...
		- ...takes up all of our energy and attention
		- ...distorts us, making us stiff and lopsided
		- ...is exhausting, straining, stiffening
	- Being "hooked" makes us feel a lot of turmoil and anxiety...all these feelings are warning signals issued by our spiritual musscles to tell us that our Who center, our real self, is ==not designed for such dependency==
		- Related to the function of pain in our body (See [[Cards/The True Self]])
	- Letting go of the hook may be painful at first (falling onto the cold hard ground)...but it makes us free to move on our own again
		- "It is a hard-won and painful freedom, but it is freedom, and it signals growth." [[Cards/We grow when we let go]]
		- The importance of wonder...of being open to possibilities outside of this hook (See [[Cards/Absolute Certainty versus Wonder]])
-   **What does our deepest desire have to do with detachment? (Take note of the difference between the _stick way_ versus the _carrot way_.)** ^b0c625
	- We can deal with our addictions in two ways:
		- **Stick way (the *ascetic* way):** [[Cards/Ascetism]]
			- I am becoming aware that I have these particular dependencies, attachments, compulsion, crutches, idols
			- I will spend all my energy in trying to destroy them
			- If my idols are like the Isarelites' golden calf, then I will attend ot the matter of getting rid of my calf
			- I will achieve freedom in this way
		- **Carrot way (the way of the *deepest desire*):** ^ab5855
			- I am becoming aware of my attachments...
			- I will not try to get rid of them by my own efforts.
			- Instead, I will use the limited energy I have to attend to those things in my experience where I feel right with God, or on solid ground, or living true. 
			- These will become the music in my heart that leads me into the dance and overrides the fear that keps me clinging to the rails. 
			- I will not spend my energy trying to melt down my golden calf.
			- Instead, I will turn my attention to the holy mountain and my journey toward it, with all of God's surprises along the way.
				- [[Cards/Absolute Certainty versus Wonder]]: the need to have a mindset focused on wonder
			- In this way, God will lead me to freedom without my even realizing that is is happening.
-   **Describe the difference between the Strategy of Enslavement versus the Strategy of Liberation.** ^96bf2e
	- The first is me centered; the second is God centered
	- The first is labored and heavy; the second is light and joy filled
		- [[Cards/Desolation]] v.s. [[Cards/Consolation]]
	- The first depends on sticks, the second on carrots
	- The first is centered on my fears, the second on my desires
	- The first is a burden, the second an adventure

### Other Highlights
> Ignatius urges us to seek the freedom of detachment or indifference...In his [[Cards/The First Principle and Foundation]], [he] talks about "making use of those things that help to bring us closer to God and leaving aside those things that don't."
