## Notes
### The Ancient World's Greatest Empire
- Emperor Trajan's government was best at using **art as a political tool.**
	- He celebrated his successes in Dacia (a.k.a. Romania) by erecting a 128-foot-tall column in Rome
	- 3 bands midway up the column of Trajan: ![[Extras/Media/Images/Column of Trajan.png]]
	- In general, the way the Romans use art to manipulate public opinion (as seen in portraits and narrative reliefs) is similar to how contemporary political campaigns carefully craft their imagery
- Exemplified by the frieze, which is characterized by the **repetition of standard motifs.**
	- For example: ==Trajan's personal involvement== in all aspects of the Dacian campaigns (and in turn, expanding Rome's empire), was one of the Column's central messages; this was shown by how he could be seen directing the operation ==from every vantage point==
	- Frieze: a broad horizontal band of [sculpted](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=570571948&q=sculpted&si=ALGXSlY2XXqfLjvIaFfTE-GUlBx5dx7SxAFoLQTEQf7Rk-JFYC-1xCdBxmrYbRSotQNJPwTuTIrm-PYjgK8gc-z30RGDGvSCnw%3D%3D&expnd=1) or painted decoration, especially on a wall near the ceiling
- Rome as ***caput mundi**:* the "head (capital) of the world"
	- Roman monuments of art and architecture are the most conscipicious and numerous of any ancient civilziation...
	- Examples
		- Temples and basilicas have an afterlife as churches...
		- Buildings form the cores of modern houses, museums...
		- Bullfights, sporting events, etc. take place in Ampitheaters...
	- In short...the Roman mastery of concrete construction began an architectural revolution still felt today
	- Modern world was foreshadowed by its diversity and ecleticism
### Etruscan Art
- Etruscans lacked political cohesion
	- Cities never united to form a state
	- Any semblance of unity among the independent cities was based on common linguistic ties and religious beliefs + practices
	- Because of this, Etruscans relatively easy prey for the Romans
#### Etruscan Temples
- The distinctive Etruscan temperament
	- According to Roman architect Virtuvius (for temple design)
	- Entrance was at center of the front 
	- Columns were only at the front (compared to Greek temples, where they were everywhere)
	- ==Fewer + more widely spaced columns== were the standard, since temples had to support light superstructures
	- Tuscan columns were made of wood, were unfluted, and had bases
			- still resembled Greek Doric columns
		- Temples frequently had ==three cellas==, one for each of their chief gods
			- Tinia (Zeus/Jupiter)
			- Uni (Juno/Hera)
			- Menrva (Minerva/Athena)
		- Narrative statuary (in terracotta instead of stone) > pedimental statuary 
			- Narrative
				- Sculptures that depict a story, scene, or series of events. 
				- Often used to convey a specific narrative or theme
				- More detailed and intricate as a result
			- Pedimental
				- Sculptures located within a classical building's pediment: the triangular space at the top of the front facade of a temple or similar structure.
				- Often the focal point of the building's facade and typically consists of a central group of sculptures flanked by architectural elements (known as the pedimental group). 
					- Often designed to depict a significant scene or represent a particular theme or deity.
				- Primary purpose: provide a visual and symbolic representation of the building's purpose or significance.
	- Because of the materials architects employed (wood and mud brick, only the foundations of their temples survived
		- Only the high podium was made of stone

#### Apollo of Veii
- Finest surviving Archaic Etruscan temple statue: the life-size image of Apulu (a.k.a. Greco-Roman Apollo)
- Archaic Etruscan art is characterized by energy and excitement, which this statue exemplifies
	- Bright paint and rippling folds of garments
	- Virgorous striding motion, festiculating arms, fanlike calf muscles, animated face
![[Extras/Media/Images/Apulu statue.png]]
#### Cerveteri Sacophagus
- Favored medium for life-size statuary: terracotta
- Sacrophagus: "flesh-eater"
	- Mot ancient ones contained bodies of the deceased
	- But this one in Cerveteri contained only ashes, since cremation was the most common means of disposing the dead in Etruscan Italy
- The image of a husband and wife sharing the same banquet is uniquely Etruscan
	- Only men dined at Greek banquets; women remained at home, excluded from most aspects of public life
	- Greeks buried their dead in simple graves marked by vases, statues, or stele
- Also shared the same animated style as Apollo of Veii
	- In comparison to the stiff and formal figures in Egyptian funerary sculpture
- Also Etruscan: the uneven rendering of the upper and lower parts of each body
	- Artist only summarily modeled the legs
	- Transition to torso at the waist was unnatural
	- Focus on ==upper half of the figures==
		- Especially vibrant faces and gesticulating arms
		- But these allow them to resonate more with audiences
	- Meanwhile, contemporary Greek statues emphasized proportion and balance

#### Banditaccia Necropolis
- Mound or *tumulus*: typical tomb in the Necropolis
	- Each one covered one of more subterreannean multichambered tombs cut out of dark local limestone called tufa
- Necropolis: "city of the dead"...which can be used to describe the Cerveteri cemetery
- Ceveteri tumuli highlight very **different values** of the Etruscans and the Greeks
	- Etruscans' grand underground tombs are as permanent as the bedrock itself 
		- In comparison to their temples, which no longer stand because they were constructed of wood and mud brick
	- Greeks rarely built monumental tombs for their dead, but employed stone for the shrines of their gods
	- TL;DR: Etruscans valued humanity; Greeks valued their gods
- Most decorated tomb: **Tomb of the Reliefs**
	- Accomodated the remains of several generations of a single family
	- Everything (walls, ceiling beams, piercs, and funerary couches) were made out of tufa bedrock
	- Brightly painted stucco reliefs cover the stone
	- Items in the tomb (e.g. stools, mirrors, drinking cups, pitchers, and knives) effectively suggest a domestic context
		- Underscores ==the visual and conceptual connection== between Etruscan houses of the dead and those of the living

 #### Tomb of the Leopards
 - Etruscans also decorated their underground burial chambers with mural paintings
 - Painted tombs are rare because only the wealthiest families could afford this

 #### Capitoline Wolf

 #### Aule Metele
