### Highlights
#### What it is, and why it's important
> Neuroplasticity, or **the capacity for our brain cells to change in response to our behavior**, can help us more thoughtfully engage in activities that will contribute to our well-being–no matter our age.

> We can influence our brain development in positive or negative directions. The more we engage and challenge our mind and body, the longer our brains function at a high level.

#### How it works
> Neuroplastic change occurs at the chemical, structural and functional levels of the brain. These changes work in concert with one another.

> **Chemical change** occurs in the initial stages of learning something new. Chemical change primarily influences short-term memory or short-term improvement in a motor skill.

> **Structural change** occurs when neurons in the brain change their connections, altering your brains structure. This type of change requires more effort and time. It involves long-term memory and long-term improvement of a motor skill.

> **Functional change** occurs when entire brain networks change. These brain networks, as they are used over and over again, become more excitable and more efficient when activated.

> ==The more the brain is exercised, the stronger and more connected it becomes.== The connections occur across the brain’s grey and white matter. Grey matter is neural tissue that includes regions of the brain involved in muscle control, sensory perception (e.g., seeing, hearing), memory, emotions, speech, decision-making and self-control. White matter connects grey matter regions together.

#### How to get started
Neuroplastic change requires five components:
|       **Component**        |                                                                                     **How It Works**                                                                                     |                                                                                      **Try It Now**                                                                                      |
|:--------------------------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|  **Challenge & Novelty**   |                              The skill should be new-to-you and not too easy to learn. Novelty and challenge are essential components for cognitive change.                              |                                     Think of something you’ve always wanted to try (e.g., learn a new language, mountain climbing, play the guitar).                                     |
|       **Intention**        | The skill you are practicing must have some meaning, relevance, or importance to you. Neuroplastic change is associated with the feeling of being rewarded while engaging in a new task. | Think about _why_ you want to learn this skill (e.g., I love traveling, I love being in the mountains, I love guitar music). Make sure it matters to you personally, then write it down. |
|   **Specific Attention**   |                                           The skills we practice tend to improve. Focusing on exact tasks increases the likelihood of change.                                            |                                    Have a plan. Schedule time in your calendar to focus on this task. Consider setting a personal goal and incentive.                                    |
| **Repetition & Intensity** |                                     One-and-done is not enough. Shorter bouts of intense repetition are usually needed to creating new connections.                                      |                                             Check in with yourself weekly. Have you been following your plan? If not, adjust and keep going.                                             |
|          **Time**          |                                     Be patient with yourself. Neuroplastic change takes time in order for structural and functional change to occur.                                     |                                                      Plan for lapses – it’s normal. Refocus, adjust your schedule, and keep going.                                                       |
