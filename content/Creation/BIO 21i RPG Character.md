title: "BIO 21i RPG Character"

## Guidelines
- _**Origins of Life and** **Species**_: 
	- Tell us about **at least one unique** **milestone in the evolution** of your species from its ancestors. 
		- The first step is to identify and describe an ancestral species. It doesn't have to be the direct ancestor; you can establish that the available fossil records do not reveal what that direct ancestor is! 
		- From that ancestor, what is at least one major evolutionary change that resulted in your character's species? How are these changes reflected in the species' in-game traits?
	- Additionally, talk a little about **how (and whether) these milestones inform your species' culture.** How do they perceive and respond to their ancestry?
- **_Biological Processes_**: Pick one of two:
	- Tell us about **a species that causes disease in or parasitizes on** your species. Talk about the evolutionary arms race between the two species. Is this evolutionary relationship reflected in any way in the species' in-game traits? How has your species' society learned to deal with this relationship?
	- Tell us about your species' societal and cultural concepts of **gender and sex**, if any. Is this reflected in any way by their biology, and what are the implications for how they mate and how their culture views reproduction?
- **_Biology and_** _**Society**_:
	- Design a **biotechnology-based enhancement** that your species uses and/or that your character would be interested in obtaining. Give it a name, describe what it does (not required, but if you can use D&D game terms in terms of its effects, that would be cool), and tell us how easy or difficult it would be to obtain (i.e. in terms of general accessibility--is it out in the open market or is it more of a black market thing?--and cost). Talk a bit about **how this enhancement interacts with your character's physiology as well as its value in their society and culture.**
- _**Ecology and Worldbuilding**_:
	- Tell us about **the world that you character and their species call home**. Describe some important details about the planet before focusing on your character's (or the species') **home environment**. Describe that environment's climate, major flora and fauna, and other interesting ecological features. Make sure that these are consistent with the traits of your species! Additionally, talk about **how this has influenced your species' culture and society**, keeping in mind what we know about them so far.

			- The concept for the imagery came from a dear educator I met from UP College of Fine Arts who said that Filipinos are the cockroaches of the world due to our ability to adapt to other lands and external pressure. He said this with utmost respect and love for our countrymen. And given the weight of this article, it is the best time to shed light on possible issues that could come from our go-getter attitude (see: martyrdom) to prove ourselves worthy of the opportunities we have, despite these being exploitative and inhumane.
			- _I hired Town, a nonbinary Filipino artist, because I knew that this piece on OFWs needs an authentic Filipino voice to illustrate it. I was a little surprised when they proposed the concept of the illustrations: cockroaches! But once they told me their rationale, it made so much sense. I think it was a stroke of genius, if a little unusual: In one fell swoop, the imagery portrays resilience as well as the racism that OFWs often experience abroad, as they are looked down upon by everyone but nonetheless persist in any situation. I’m quite aware of the mockery that foreign domestic workers face, and I think having a Filipino artist reclaim the imagery of cockroaches speaks plenty to the agency of Filipinos in this complex phenomenon we are portraying._

			- If we're sticking with official playable races (so Thri-Kreen is out), it would be a toss-up between a Warforged (hard natural armour, resistance to disease and poison), or a Simic Hybrid (and have them take cockroach-ish features like Carapace, Nimble Climber and Grappling Appendages). Probably the latter, I'd say.

		- Origin of Life and Species
			- Ancestor: normal cockroaches and humans
			- Evolutionary change: 
				- cockroaches together with some moss were sent on Mars. Due to an endless downpour of space radiation and -80C temperatures, this harsh environment has finally forced the cockroaches, who have not changed their shape in 300 million years to evolve.
				- In a distant future where most of the world has been destroyed by [terrorists](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Lucas_Bishop_(Earth-1191) "Lucas Bishop (Earth-1191)"), the remaining humans living in the United States began to experiment with integrating cockroach DNA into their bodies, mutating them into Cockroach-hybrids, able to survive in their harsh world.
					- Human-changing hatchlings. Skin extremely hard, and extremely tough to kill.
				- Sent to work on faraway planets for labor (similar to OFWs)
					- Dehumanizing
			- How this inspires their culture: 
				- balikbayan? Homesick? How do they reconnect with their roots, despite being so far away? Diaspora?

					- The point of their work is to build the perfect cockroach cyborg: an animal that can crawl into tiny holes and around jagged edges with recording equipment, for surveillance, for example. Or, if there's an earthquake and a building crashes, Liang says, deploy them to the second floor for search and rescue, "so when they reach there, they can work as a vehicle. If they can carry any sensors, cameras, they can collect information for us."

## Writing
### Physical
- Roachkin are humanoid cockroach-people. They have large compound eyes and two long antennae protruding from their heads. Their limbs are long and gangly with the arms and legs leading to five-clawed hands and feet. A tough carapace protects their back and wings while a waxy substance coats their skin. They are not known for their good looks to say the least.

### History
- Roachkin have infested the earth since the days of the primordials. Ancestors of the currently living are said to have seen the births and deaths of Gods. Being highly adaptable, their communities have found homes in nearly every corner of the earth. In early times they were a nomadic race, frequently traveling amongst food sources, but in the recent age they have settled down and tend to spend most of their life in the same place. Having seen nearly every major historical event, the written texts of ancient Roachkin would be an invaluable resource had the Roachkin ancients not written primarily about what sort of feces tastes best.

### Society
- Roachkin societies tend towards living where there's plenty of food, and they will eat just about anything. The staple jobs of any Roachkin community are farming, ranching, foraging, and hunting. They place a high value on resourcefulness and adaptability. This allows them to form communities in nearly any climate and in any setting from the wilderness to the big cities. They are a generally amicable race, prefering to live alongside other races and benefit from their resources. They are especially amenable to humans and changelings, finding them equally adaptable, and dwarves for their natural resourcefulness.
