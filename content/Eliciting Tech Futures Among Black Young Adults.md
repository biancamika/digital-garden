## Highlights
- We wanted to use speculative methods to elicit thoughts and ideas on the future of technology and design. We were specifcally interested in how these young adults envisioned utopian futures of their local environment. In a series of co-design sessions (six overall), we investigated the following research questions:
	- In what ways does co-design support the generation of ideas for a utopian future for Chicago youth? 
		- (Philippine youth? Filipino technologists?)
	- What are Chicago youth’s imagined utopian and dystopian futures and what is technology’s role in these utopian and dystopian futures?
	- How might design fctions as a method of futuring elicit new ideas that speak to Chicago youth’s concepts of a post- pandemic utopian reality?
		- (a more equitable technological future?)
- We employed content analysis to draw and analyze themes from the transcriptions. Storyboards, design scenarios, and design fctions were all analyzed through thematic analysis to identify themes [3]. We analyzed questionnaire results for descriptive data about our sample to understand a baseline of education, technology skills, and self-efcacy.
- Themes that emerged: addressing social conditions in Chicago, returning to nor- mal social behaviors, and speculative technologies as metaphors of existing oppression.
