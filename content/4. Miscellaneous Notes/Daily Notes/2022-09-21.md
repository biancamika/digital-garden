### Articulating Learning Objectives
#### Guess the goals
> Before we get into the nitty gritty of what objectives are and how to write them effectively, let's begin with a quick throwback exercise. Without reviewing your syllabus documents, remember a course you have taken in the past (1st Quarter to past few years). 
> 
> 1. Identify the course and think about what you gained/learned from the course. (it's up to you as to how you phrase this)
> 2. Then, recall what the course aimed for (the course learning objectives) - how similar or different were your gains/learnings from what was "on paper"/set by the course originally?

#### What are objectives for?
According to Borich, there are three main reasons why educators should write objectives.
1. Translate standards into **observable** classroom accomplishments.
	2. Teaching challenge 1: What is a **long-term goal** for a subject you want to teach?
		1. E.G. Long-term goal: decision making to address climate change
			1. A grade school student may not be able to do as much as an adult. However, a learning objective you can have is articulating what this looks like in your student's setting/context. One observable classroom accomplishment: throwing trash in the proper trash bin
2. Inform learners of what is **expected**.
	1. Teaching challenge 2: What is an example of an **action** or **decision** that you think you can see students make or do, related to this long-term goal?
		1. E.G. Based on the observable classroom accomplishment, we can expect grade school students to identify the various categories of trash (e.g. types of items like plastic, what not to recycle)
3. **Inform** and **frame** instructional activities.
	1. Teaching challenge 3: Based on the **action/s** and or **decisions** that you would like your students to be able to make, what do they need to **know** or be able to do?
	2. E.G. Aside from categories of trash, students may also need to learn about the process of recycling and ecology (non-biodegradable v.s. biodegradable). Instructional activities they can do based on these are going on field trips to see recycling plants or forests; in these places, they can be toured around by guides who explain to them what conditions are like.

Learning objectives lead us to...
- Clarity
- Transparency
- Depth
- Relevance

#### The anatomy of an objective
So, how do we actually write an objective? We'll start by clarifying what it is NOT. Then, we'll break down what goes into a learning objective statement.
**Here's a quick exercise** _(try to answer the question below - just in your head). **Let's say these are statements for early grades students****:**_
![[images/Pasted image 20220921014023.png]]

The right answer is number 3 - Students will practice the multiplication tables. How is this statement different from the other two?

![[images/Pasted image 20220921014107.png]]

Statement 1 and 2 point to an =="end state"== or what we've started to call a =="desired result"==, while # 3 is just a statement that describes a learning activity. 

Since the sentences seem alike, you'll have to remind yourself of the litmus test - ==is it a means or an end for the target learner?== the example above was for early grades, which helps us assume that they could not do # 1 and 2 yet. 

However, if say we change the context to the upper grades (ex. Gr5-7), # 1 and 2 seem so elementary and could be learning activities that lead to a more complex objective. This leads us to the first key idea about learning objectives: ==**🔑 Learning objectives should describe a desired result, not just an activity.**==

##### Writing Effective Objectives
- Let's reverse engineer this statement: **"Students should be able to write an essay on a given topic without grammatical errors."** What do you think makes this a good objective?
- Key components:
	- ==**Behavioral:** ==observable and measurable; identifies the **performance** and the **product**
		- E.G. "write an essay"
	- Identify the learning ==**conditions**==
		- E.G. "on a given topic"
	- Identify the ==**criterion**==
		- Criterion: set of standards you want student to achieve
		- Standards can be of a particular discipline (e.g. writing), or time?
		- There are some times when learning objectives don't identify the criterion because what teachers do in these instances is talk about the criterion in terms of **grading**

##### Moore's "Classroom Teaching Skills"
Clarifying the difference between conditions and criterion

##### Lesson Cont.
In the video and excerpt above, I touched on the following key ideas:

**🔑** **Learning objectives should articulate the ==target behavior.== What is the verb that describes what you want your students to be able to do after the class or course?**

**🔑** **Learning objectives should articulate the ==condition and criterion.== What is the context by which you hope for learners to do the behavior? What are the standards that you want them to achieve?**

> Come up with 3 learning objectives for a subject area/year level that you would like to teach in in the future. In your post:
> 
> 1. Identify the subject area and year level
> 2. 3 learning objectives - label the parts (behavior, condition, criterion)


#### Making your objectives bloom
- Apart from articulating clear aims/goals for your course, learning objectives can also be a powerful mechanism to make sure that learning is deepened in your class or course.
-  Remember our earlier discussion forum when you said that teachers who "didn't teach" were those who just asked you to memorize some facts? There is a reason why, as a learner, you felt this way! 
- It's probably because you were not led to deepen or apply your thinking - much of which you can plan to happen early on, by coming up with learning objectives using a common framework called "Bloom's Taxonomy".

##### How to write learning objectives using Bloom's Taxonomy
- created by educational psychologist Benjamin Bloom
- Not all learning objectives are created equal. By determining the level by which a learning objective is in, we can make sure that ur learning objectives help deepen a students' understanding and ability.

##### Lesson Cont.

> 1. In the learning objectives in the previous discussion forum, did you write more lower order objectives (remember, understand, apply) or higher order objectives (analyze, evaluate, create)?
> 2. Any questions about coming up with learning objectives?

## PH Design
#design #culture #Filipino 
- Pancit as culture...pancit as design
- Design isn't just aesthetics... we have to think about its roots...
- There are 100+ kinds of pancit!
- We have the privilege to do research
- Food also counts as information! (What we eat, how we eat)...information that isn't necessarily passed down through publications, communications
- Issues with fusion cusine...because what cusine is not a fusion?
- Culture is not fixed/permanent...it is always evolving
- All of us have culture...we just don't pay attention to it
- Humanities/social sciences are seen as a means to enhance STEM...as if we're not our own fields...parang palabok
- Research isn't just found online...it can be found in books, in asking the makers...

### Significance of Pancit as Culinary Heritage
- Various dimensions
	- Agricultural: where does it come from? what's the environment it was made in..
	- Symbolic: what does it mean?
	- Historical: how did it get here? how did it get transferred...
	- Spiritual: same dimension as historical ^
	- Culinary: how do you cook the pancit?
	- Social: it means something when you have it as a community
	- Aesthetic: we pay attention to how we present it...whether it be a party or fine dining setting..
	- Economic: why is pancit so cheap and affordable? who eats pancit on a regular basos (which strata)
- **How can you probe the significance of (everyday) design through these dimensions?**
	- Culinary -> epistemic (knowledge)
		- education x philosophy
		- how do we get to know this subject on a deeper level?
	- Agricultural -> environmental
- The Jeep
	- Aesthetic: 
		- every jeepney is unique
		- Why is the jeepney small? Made for Filipino heights
	- Economic: 
		- public transport; lower to middle class
		- lengthened to accommodate more passengers
	- Historical: 
		- remade from jeepneys that were left behind by American troops 
		- how was it adopted from the American build?
	- Environmental: 
		- urban settings
		- attached a roof to protect them from the scorching Philippine heat
	- Symbolic: reflection of the Filipino spirit — resilient, innovative, and optimistic.
	- Epistemic: valued simplicity; not much changes; welding
	- Spiritual: 
		- Catholic imagery....imagery of what they find important...sports, national imagery
		- "God bless our trip"
		- https://lakansining.wordpress.com/2018/12/04/god-bless-our-trip-religious-jeepney-art-along-aurora-boulevard-quezon-city/
	- Social: a transitional place, routes for commonly traveled to places

## Thesis
### Consultation Feedback
- there are so many ways you can take this
- Internet lore: how representative is it?
- SPECIFY what aspect of internet culture and memes you're going to talk about. The most relevant would be... what are the kinds of memes generated by the recent elections? Analyze how they're structured with information design, along with computer science knowledge (algorithms...)
- What kind of world view is it promoting?
- Make sure that it's specific enough to the point that you can make an argument about it...
- Make sure that the audience you have access to (Atenean students)...
- How to integrate CS
	- Look at computer science as analysis and description of things like algorithms.... content production..... ETC.
	- Less as theory, more of production (apply to website development)
- Look at purpose of satire, comedy, criticism
	- Political origins; questioning people in power
	- E.G. Black comedians
- I need a specific framework
	- What data? What framework? How do they work together? 
	- Make sure that they serve the objectives/questions
