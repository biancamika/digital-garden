### Walang Rape sa Bontok
- "We are searching for a society, a rape-less society. And societies change. Constantly." (12:09)
- "Today, we are Christians; but in those days, we were firmer. People's morals were stronger, they knew what's right and wrong" (20:56)
- **Barriers that prevented rape from entering traditional Bontoc society**
	- Spiritual + moral beliefs
		- "lawa": anything forbidden/taboo
			- E.G. incest
		- "inayan": things you must not do lest you invite the anger of nature spirits
			- E.G. outdoor sex
	- Life in the terraces
- Women have a unique and special power that prevents them from getting raped in the midst of war; genitals as weapons
- "You must not gaze upon which you came from. All the world came from that of the woman."
- fixed/arranged marriages
- Even abusers are victims...it's not their fault for growing up in that kind of environment
	- "If you look at it that way, it is the system, the culture, that was at fault."
- We can actually mold the psyche of an entire people

### The subaltern and the spiral of silence

> **spiral of silence**, in the study of [human communication](https://www.britannica.com/topic/communication) and [public opinion](https://www.britannica.com/topic/public-opinion), the theory that people’s willingness to express their opinions on controversial public issues is affected by their largely unconscious perception of those opinions as being either popular or unpopular. Specifically, the perception that one’s opinion is unpopular tends to [inhibit](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/inhibit) or discourage one’s expression of it, while the perception that it is popular tends to have the opposite effect. Developed by German survey and communication researcher Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann in the 1960s and ’70s, the [spiral](https://www.britannica.com/science/spiral-mathematics) of silence theory more broadly attempts to describe [collective](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/collective) opinion formation and societal [decision making](https://www.britannica.com/topic/decision-making) regarding issues that are controversial or morally loaded.

> Overall, the findings indicate that in the Snowden case, social media did not provide new forums for those who might otherwise remain silent to express their opinions and debate issues. Further, if people thought their friends and followers in social media disagreed with them, they were less likely to say they would state their views on the Snowden-NSA story online and in other contexts, such as gatherings of friends, neighbors, or co-workers. This suggests ==a spiral of silence might spill over from online contexts to in-person contexts==, though our data cannot definitively demonstrate this causation. It also might mean that ==the broad awareness social media users have of their networks might make them more hesitant to speak up because they are especially tuned into the opinions of those around them.==

#### Answer
- Can you think of other examples where "voices" are silenced through design?
-   How do you think we can break free from this systemic process of silencing?

Outline:
- Example of voices silenced by design:
	- The "off-line": marginalized underemployed/unemployed and 'technologically intimidated' groups who lack the financial resources to participate at all in cyberculture (the digital underclass)
	- The digital underclass is invisible, except where its movements are tracked by surveillance systems aimed at keeping people in their 'electonic ghettoes'
- How can we break free of this?
	- be aware of the ways social class and cyberculture are interrelated

The silencing of "voices" through design reminded of  my Cultural Studies of Technology class, where we discussed class in cyberculture. According to Alessandro Aurigi and Stephen Graham (1998), there are three groups that make up the "social architecture of cyberspace", one of which is the "off-line": marginalized underemployed/unemployed and 'technologically intimidated' groups who lack the financial resources to participate at all in cyberculture — this makes them the digital underclass. This underclass is invisible to most of the population. However, they are still visible to surveillance systems, who track their movements so that they can kept in their "electronic ghettoes"; these are defined by danah boyd as digital spaces in which user population has focused on a given subculture, mirroring social divisions from the physical world. An example of this can be seen in most Filipino schoolchildren. Their main source of wifi comes from either bite-sized internet plans or [*pisonets*](https://restofworld.org/2022/philippines-pisonet-internet-access/). Since every click or minute spent online is costly to them, they're discouraged from exploring the webs and end up staying in familiar spaces; one example being the free data version of Facebook — [which is the same as "The Internet" for them](https://longreads.com/2018/09/13/facebook-isnt-the-same-as-the-internet-except-when-it-is/). I believe journalism is one way we can break free from this systematic process of silencing. Journalists have the power to elevate these silenced voices on their platforms so that others can become aware of them and the issues they face, whether it be [suffering with terrible internet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeaUPLSa1DY) or [struggling with content moderation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Py_ZJ5q-MFo).


## Afrofuturism
- I was excited to get into "Afrofuturism: From a Lens to a Portal" because I thought it would teach me a lot about a movement I've been drawn to for so long. And I was right! I did end up learning a lot. Olu Niyi-Awosusi's piece took me on all kinds of rabbitholes, from afropessimism to solarpunk. Going through all of these was a breeze  because they were naturally embedded in Olu's perspectives as a Black person: their own encounters with Afrofuturist works, the ambivalent feelings they experienced with them, and the insightful realizations that they come to. Being a non-Black outsider, I found their personal exploration of the movement eye-opening. Before reading this essay, I could've said that I knew what Afrofuturism is, having read wiki definitions and relevant works; But I definitely gained a new understanding of the movement after when seeing it from Olu's eyes.
- Thus, I was surprised to find myself connecting with this piece. One of the lines that struck me the most was the recognition of erasure: "I began to recognize that we had always been inventing and building and innovating, but our discoveries were crushed into the machinery of a white supremacist and capitalistic culture, obscuring those who didn’t look like the ones in power." As a neurodivergent Southeast Asian woman, I highly related to this realization. When I was younger, I romanticized the idea of living and working in the States because I believed that was where all the innovation happened. As I matured, these rose-colored glasses went away. I'm already surrounded by so much innovation, but it's just not getting the credit it deserves; for instance, in all kinds of industries, from animation to tech, foreign companies outsource to the Philippines so that they can exploit cheap Filipino labor. 
- It sucks to live in a world designed against you. Perhaps this is where the power of aesthetics lies; as said by Olu: "...[it empowers] us to imagine new futures, to build utopias and to usher in a new world." Thanks to this essay, I'm excited to dream again.

	- I was attracted to both its richness, seen in everything from its diverse color palette to its preoccupation with technoculture, and its underlying spirit of optimism.
	- No matter what form an Afrofuturist work takes, it never fails to advocate for a  better futures. 
	- This in turn inspired me to dream big, wanting to see these hopeful futures come to life.
	- However, a part of me dismissed these futures as mere fantasies. Despite how inspiring they were, I believed that they could never work in the real world, which was tainted by systemic oppression.
