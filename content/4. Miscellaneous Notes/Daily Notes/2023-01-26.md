## Discerning Life Questions
#religion #spirituality #philosophy 
### The Need for Certainty

### Lecture 1: Living Our Questions
1. **Problem v.s. Mystery**
	2. 2 examples: org project v.s. mother. These show the difference between a problem and a mystery
	3. **Problem**
		1. begins with not knowing
		2. can be solved from a disinterested/impersonal standpoint
	4. **Mystery**
		1. begins with knowing, leading to more knowing
		2. invites a person into further understanding since the meaning of that mystery is inexhaustible
		3. a mystery must include the person inquiring about it -> you need commitment/investment in taking deeper understanding
	4. A mystery can be approached with 2 dispositions
		1. **Absolute certainty**
			1. We always operate with limited certainty; absolute certainty does NOT exist
				1. You cannot fit the largeness/complexity of this world into your mind
			2. When we live with absolute certainty, we resort to Reductionism: looking at a complex world from a simplistic perspective
				1. Fundamentalism: a firm and rigid adherence to a fundamental set of beliefs and doctrines
					1. Typically found in religious circles; laws are laws. E.G. "Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve"
					2. Less about thinking, more about following
				2. Relativism: Truth is ultimately dependent on the individual or a group. Objective truth does not exist.
					1. The forwarding of so many different truths -> losing objective truths + a shared sense of reality
					2. Also does not require thinking
				3. Both of these mindsets reveal a proclivity towards control
					1. We close ourselves to the possibility of other things
		2. **Wonder**
			1. The disposition of a learner.
			2. It requires...
				1. Constantly revisiting the ordinary. 
					1. Seeing the mundane with fresh eyes and perspectives
				2. Engaging and allowing.  
					1. Not taking things as they are
					2. Asking questions & being open
				3. Humility.  
					1. About seeing the truth of who you are, rather than pulling yourself down
					2. Knowing where I am right now
					3. Comes from the word *humus*, which means soil
						1. A seedling in soil is vulnerable, exposed to the elements, to the vermin, yet this is where it grows
						2. This is one way you can discern a life question that will result in change/status quo â€” will you grow?
				4. Commitment
					1. You only get to know more about a mystery when you commit to it with wonder
					2. Letting go & growth
2. **Complementarities** 
	1. Atenean indecision?
	2. Thinking in absolutes.
	3. Traps in decision-making.
	4. Order and chaos.
	5. Partial and reasonable certitude. 

## Biology of Science Fiction
#sciencefiction #biology

**MODULE 1:** Introduction to Science Fiction

### The Literature of Cognitive Estrangement
- "SF takes off from **a fictional ('literary') hypothesis** and **develops it with extrapolating and totalizing ('scientific') rigor.**"
- "The effect of such **factual reporting of fictions** is one of **confronting a set normative system**...with a point of view or glance implying **a new set of norms**."
- "A representation which estranges is one which **allows us to recognize its subject**, but at the same time **makes it seem unfamiliar.**" (Brecht)

### The *Novum*
- Latin: "new" or "new thing" (in Suvin's essay, "a strange newness")
- A _novum_ is a **point of difference** between the science fiction text and the empirical environment/the real world.
- "An SF text may be based on one _novum_... [but] more usually it will be predicated on a number of interrelated _nova_."
- Suvin posits "a spectrum... running from the idal extreme of exact **recreation** of the author's empirical environment to **exclusive interest** in [the _novum_]."
	- E.G. magical realism v.s. X-Men?

### Science Fiction as Creative Cognition
- "SF is then a literary genre whose necessayr and sufficient conditions are the **presence and interaction of estrangement and cognition**, and whose main formal device is **an imaginative framework alternative to the author's empirical environment.**"
	- E.G. biology cells -> zombies
- "For somebody **to see all normal happens in a dubious light**, he would ned to develop [a detached eye]... It implies a creative approach tending toward **a dynamic transformation rather than toward a static mirroring** of the author's environment."
	- E.G. seeing cancer cells as tragic enemies in _Cells at Work_
- "Such typical methodology of SF...is a _critical_ one, often satirical, combining **a belief in the potentialities of reason with methodical doubt.**"

### Interlude: Semiotics 101
- **Semiotics (n):** the study of signs and meaning-making
- From Greek *semeiotikos*, "observant of signs"
- **Sign (n):** something that attempts to communicate meaning beyond its literal appearance
- See [[4. Miscellaneous Notes/Daily Notes/2022-06-27]]

### Relationships with Other Genres
- Science fiction has roots in **"blessed island"** stories (Greek/Hellenistic), the **"fabulous voyage"** (Antiquity on), **"utopia"** and **"planetary novel"** stories (Baroque/Renaissance), **the state/political novel** (Enlightenment), **"anti-utopia"** and **"anticipation"** stories (modern), etc.
- "SF shares with myth, fantasy, fairy tale, and pastoral **an opposition to naturalistic or empiricist literary** genres" but "differs... **in approach and social function.**"
- "The myth is diametrically opposed to the cognitive approach since it conceives **human relations as fixed, and supernaturally determined.**"
- "SF sees the norms of any age, including emphatically its own, as **unique, changeable, and therefore subject to cognitive glance.**"
- "Where **the myth claims to explain** once and for all the essence of phenomena, **SF posits them first as problems and then explores where they lead to;** it sees the mythical static identity as an illusion."

### Wonder, Critique, and Possibility
- "Significant modern SF...discusses primarily the political, psychological, anthropological *use and effect of sciences, and philosophy of science,* and **the becoming or failure of new realities as a result of it.**"
	- E.G. Black Mirror's *Nosedive*
- "This genre has always been wedded to **a hope of finding[,] in the unknown[,] the ideal** environment, tribe, state, intelligence or other aspect of the Supreme Good (or to a **fear and revulsion from its contrary**)."
- "I look to science fiction and fantasy as the ==aspirational drive of the Zeitgeist==: we creators are the engineers of posibility. And as this genre finally, however grudgingly, acknowledges that the dreams of the marginalized matter and that all of us have a future, so will go the world." (Jemisin, 2018)
