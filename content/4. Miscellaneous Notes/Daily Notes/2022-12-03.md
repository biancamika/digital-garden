			- EXAMPLE
			- As such, we propose the term digital labor bayanihan as encapsulating a Filipino cultural value that shapes the collective “anchoring” of digital platform workers to survive a precarious digital market. Although this “concept” emerges from the Philippine context, the ideas may be relatable to or extended in contexts where sources of collective imaginaries are comparable. 
			- In the process of coaching, labor influencers also cascade imaginaries of success to their audiences...These imaginaries of success can be seen as a modern form of “coaching” manifested through self-branding techniques such as repetition styles and sharing of personal narratives.
			- While [digital labor influencers] play a crucial role in helping workers make sense of platform labor when they have no better alternatives nor access to similar forms of dynamic guidance elsewhere, they also cascade imaginaries that workers hang on to, as these nurture their economic and social aspirations, whether these latter are realized or not. It is in the heart of such contradictions that platform workers imagine new forms of sociability, visions of happiness, and economic capacities, despite uncertainty on whether these can in fact be actualized (de Peuter et al., 2017). This implies that they also perform the role not only of bridging workers with each other, but bridging workers with platforms, essentially performing unpaid labor for digital platforms. It follows that they also serve as promoters of the Philippine government’s vision of promoting Filipinos as “world class workers” while allowing it (along with digital platforms) to avoid its responsibility to attend to the deeper structures of labor inequality.
			- TL;DR by cultivating aspirations these influencers also help sustain inequities

		- EXHIBIT, METHOD
		- We might further consider how narrative generation can facilitate in bringing lofty, but ambiguous, goals back within the sphere of everyday life. In so doing, these stories can utilize various concepts (technological, legal, organizational, etc.) to illustrate how a future imaginary might impact the life choices and daily routines of a vibrant citizenry.
	- Technology of the Oppressed: Inequity and the Digital Mundane in Favelas of Brazil
		- inspiration for speculative design process probably....Mundane Technology
		- Scholars and technology designers have often perceived the oppressed as mere consumers of technologies rather than as agents empowered by them (Rangaswamy and Cutrell 2012). This tension between oppression and empowerment turns digital technologies—as with every aspect of the life of the oppressed—into a site of struggle, revealing the structural violence of the information age. Rendering such oppression visible makes it available for intervention and change (Eubanks 2012). After seeing how his neighborhood was framed online, Pedro became more aware of the biases of digital platforms. But in order for people like him to survive, they need to consciously resist oppressions and appropriate technology rather than reject it.
		- Technology is not a separate world—it is an extension of the struggles we all face. Thus, in this book, I explore ==how people critically appropriate technologies to navigate both digital and nondigital sources of oppression==. To guide this exploration, I borrow Paulo Freire’s notion of oppression, which he defines as acts of exploitation and violence and a failure “to recognize others as persons” (2000, 55). Over the course of the book, I will evolve and mature Freire’s rather vague notion of oppression, building a framework around the challenges that favela residents encounter. This framework represents how I understand the role of digital technologies in favelas: Residents grapple with daily challenges from specific axes of oppression in their lives. ==Appropriating Mundane Technologies is their act of hope; they use technology to seek liberation.== Therefore, we need to shift our understanding of the role of technology in oppressive situations.
		- Freire’s invitation to others to reinvent his ideas inspired me to develop a framework that seeks to understand why digital technologies can be simultaneously sites of oppression and tools that can be appropriated by the oppressed in their pursuit of freedom. I use the term Mundane Technology to describe this framework. It doesn’t provide a method or a set of techniques to liberate the oppressed, nor it is a pedagogical plan. Rather, I conceptualize Mundane Technology as an episteme to understand oppression and Freire’s process of conscientização in the information age. Similar to Virginia Eubanks and her arguments in Digital Dead End (2012), I believe that oppression should be the central diagnostic for technology. Using oppression as an outcome of concern allows us to see complex processes of exploitation, marginalization, powerlessness, cultural imperialism, and violence as centrally driving inequities of the information age. Identifying and calling out these systems of domination illuminate opportunities for intervention and change
		- Thus, Mundane Technologies—as appropriations of everyday technologies—are how technology is reinterpreted, adapted, and reinvented by those outside these centers of power in order to achieve liberation from oppression. Approaching Mundane Technologies as appropriations of technology opens new research avenues for culture and technology and contributes to a renewed concern for democracy

		- METHOD
		- Kenya has long been characterized by an embeddedness into the global capitalist system that is marked by unequal power relationships. 
		- Using an initial exploratory coding phase, a coding scheme was developed to code themes and interpretive codes. The codes offered a starting point for a theoretically informed textual analysis: allowing us to identify the things that people say about connectivity: both how they broadly envision it, and how they enact it in their everyday business practices.
		- All relevant sections of interviews were then reread to identify key discursive formations(4) (after Rose, 2001) and regimes of truth(5) (after Gill, 1996) that were being made persuasive.
		- Three broad themes emerged—the global village, shrinking distance, and digital augmentations—that broadly map onto key moments in the geographic literature on technology and connectivity. The following section describes the three imaginaries in more detail, and explores some of the ways in which we continue to see all of them employed in the everyday language of Kenyan businesspeople at a moment of changing technomediated positionalities.

		- BACKGROUND?
		- Marxian definition of ideology
		- Techno-Futurism is an ideology which works to obscure the rise of specific power relations.
		- Both the danger and efficacy of techno-futurist manifestation stems from the colonisation of possibility, the integration of visions of the future within actual capitalist development. Such visions are often posited as emergent realities or imperatives.
	- [Future of Digital Life Canvassings](https://www.elon.edu/u/imagining/surveys/)
		- METHOD
		- Description: Researchers at Elon University and the Pew Research Internet & Technology Project have invited experts to opt-in canvassings in 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2014, and annually in 2016-2022, asking them to share their expectations for humans and the digital future based on trends at the time. Respondents are offered a series of questions or a set of scenarios with which they can choose to agree or disagree, and they are asked to elaborate on their remarks in written responses that provide insights into challenges and opportunities of the digital future at the time of each study. T
		- Examples
			- The Metaverse
				- _**The question:** Considering what you know about the metaverse, which statement comes closer to your view about its likely evolution by 2040?_-   _By 2040 the metaverse WILL or WILL NOT be a much-more-refined and truly fully-immersive, well-functioning aspect of daily life for a half billion or more people globally._
				- The follow-up quantitative research questions were: Please elaborate on your answer. Tell us how you imagine that this shift of many online activities into more-fully-immersive digital spaces and digital life is likely to take place. Regardless of how you see the timing of this, how might it change human society? What are the likely positives of this transition? What negatives may emerge? How might it change the daily lives of the connected? And how will this transition change the way we think about our world and ourselves? We are also interested in hearing your thoughts about the role blockchain and its applications might play in this evolution of online life by 2040.
			- Hopes for Digital Life in 2035
				- The *entirety* of this particular report is based upon these participants’ responses to the following prompt, which was the final question of several that were asked of this group:
					- We invite you to imagine a better world online: What is one example of an aspect of digital life that you think could be different in 2035 than it is today? We invite you to create a vignette of something you would like to see taking place in a “new and improved” digital realm in 2035. Your example might involve politics or social activities or jobs or physical and mental health or community life or education. Feel free to think expansively and specifically.
				- In order to understand the context of these responses, it is important to note that participants were asked to respond to the following sets of questions before the question that generated the answers covered in this report
					- The evolution of digital spaces by 2035: This canvassing of experts is prompted by debates about the evolution of digital spaces and whether online life is moving in a positive or negative direction when it comes to the overall good of society. Some analysts and activists are fearful about the trajectory of digital activities; others are less concerned about the things that are happening. So, we start with a question about the way you see things evolving.
					- The question: Considering the things you see occurring online, which statement comes closer to your view about the evolution of digital spaces: 
						- Digital spaces are evolving in ways that are both positive and negative. 
						- Digital spaces are evolving in a MOSTLY POSITIVE way that is likely to lead to a BETTER future for society. 
						- Digital spaces are evolving in a MOSTLY NEGATIVE way that is likely to lead to a WORSE future for society. 
						- Digital spaces are not evolving in one direction or another.
				- The following quantitative prompt and research questions of this study were:
					- Bettering the digital public sphere: An Atlantic Monthly piece by Anne Applebaum and Peter Pomerantsev, “How to Put Out Democracy’s Dumpster Fire,” provides an overview of the questions that are being raised about the tone and impact of digital life: How much harm does the current online environment cause? What kinds of changes in digital spaces might have an impact for the better? Will technology developers, civil society, and government and business leaders find ways to create better, safer, moreequitable digital public spaces?
					- The question: Looking ahead to 2035, can digital spaces and people’s use of them be changed in ways that significantly serve the public good?
						- YES, by 2035, digital spaces and people’s use of them will change in ways that significantly serve the public good. 
						- NO, by 2035, digital spaces and people’s use of them will NOT change in ways that significantly serve the public good.
					- A large number of the expert respondents elected to remain anonymous. Because people’s level of expertise is an important element of their participation in the conversation, anonymous respondents were given the opportunity to share a description of their internet expertise or background, and this was noted, when available, in this report.
