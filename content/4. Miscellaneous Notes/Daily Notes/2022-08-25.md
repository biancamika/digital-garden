### Pagdidiwata, pag-uukir, pag-uuma
> Each of the abovementioned living cultures manifests itself in design. Think of one example each, and in a few sentences, explain to us why you chose these examples. Be more thoughtful and try to go beyond the obvious.


For *Kultura ng Pagdidiwata*, I thought of the *Kadal Tahaw*, a tribal dance performed by the T'boli tribe. The reverence for nature can be seen in both its movements and intention; the dance is inspired by the hopping and flying behavior of the Tahaw bird, and it's done in celebration of good harvest. I chose this example because I consider choreographies as kinesthetic forms of design, and I find the way it pays respect to nature charming.


For *Kultura ng Pag-uukir at Pag-uugma*, I thought of the malong, a colorful woven tube of cloth that's characteristically worn by Muslim communities in Mindanao. It can be worn in a variety of ways, one of which is being worn as a hijab — for females who need to follow the Islamic rules of modesty and dress. I chose this example because of how it applies Filipino flavor to a universal religious concept; hijabs are worn all over the world, but are any of them as unique as the malongs in the Philippines?
