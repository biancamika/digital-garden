E.L. Guerrero (they/she) is a media + software artist and developer. As a first-generation Filipino immigrant, they look through the lens of both a diasporic and native perspective. They work towards forming online and offline networks to access other facets of human experience, exploring the intersection of Filipino identity with technology and art that centres community care. Their practice assists in collective healing from systemic inequalities perpetuated by all normative forms of violence and oppression. They lean on decolonial and anti-imperialist teachings and values, and follow the cycle of coming from and returning to the land to create something new and ancestral.

**Why are you interested in participating?**
I'm dedicated to human flourishing, and I believe that the internet holds great potential for achieving this. However, it's barred by oppressive systems like technocratism and capitalism. These structures have shaped the way I've lived; no matter how much I enjoyed spending time on the web, I've always felt pressured to do anything to conform -- from buying the cool kids' virtual clothes to networking and hustling like a #/girlboss. Strugling with these experiences, I turned to theory as a place of healing (thanks to bell hooks). It opened my eyes to the systems around me, and showed me the possibility of liberation. This is now what I aim to do through my multifaceted practice.
