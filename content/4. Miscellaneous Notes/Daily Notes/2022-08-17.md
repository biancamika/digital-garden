**Bio**

- critical tech communities
- 

E.L. Guerrero (they/she) is a media + software artist and developer. As a first-generation Filipino immigrant, they look through the lens of both a diasporic and native perspective. They work towards forming online and offline networks to access other facets of human experience, exploring the intersection of Filipino identity with technology and art that centres community care. Their practice assists in collective healing from systemic inequalities perpetuated by all normative forms of violence and oppression. They lean on decolonial and anti-imperialist teachings and values, and follow the cycle of coming from and returning to the land to create something new and ancestral.

**Why are you interested in participating?**
I'm dedicated to human flourishing, and I believe that the internet holds great potential as a medium for achieving this. However, it is barred by oppressive systems like technocratism and capitalism. As a neurodivergent POC woman who grew up on the web, these structures have been embedded into the way I live online and offline 
To deal with my experiences, I turned to theory, which I saw as a place of healing (inspired by bell hooks)
- liberation through praxis
	- technology
	- education
	- artmaking
- remake the internet
