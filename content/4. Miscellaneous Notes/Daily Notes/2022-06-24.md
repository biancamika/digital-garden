## Cultural Studies of Technology
### Short Reaction Paper 1
[Introducing Microsoft Mesh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jd2GK0qDtRg)
1. Based on the video from the previous page, talk about what possible intent, need, or existing life-conditions the example technology might have been made for.
2. What kind of social change might such a device cause if it is successfully and widely adopted?
3. What positive effects could it potentially impart on society?
4. What issues, dangers, or risk of abuse do you foresee could originate from such a tool and that we should we be vigilant about?
5. 250 words minimum. 500 words maximum. You may include links/images/videos available online to support your arguments.

- What was Microsoft Mesh made for?
	- accelerated by the pandemic
		- 2 trends Microsoft noticed: remote workers are far more efficient than most business leaders ever imagined, and they miss each other.
		- the ability to work from anywhere and connect with colleagues online is awesome, but remote meetings can feel impersonal and lack the small moments that build relationships and careers.
	- based on present reality: we want to connect with each other
- What kind of social change might it cause if it is successfully and widely adopted?
	- future of work: The future of work describes changes in how work will get done over the next decade, influenced by technological, generational and social shifts.
	-  metaverse:  an Internet that creates a sense of place and facilitates rich human connection. https://www.gather.town/post/why-the-metaverse-matters
- Positive effects
	- jobs with the highest physical proximity are likely to be most disrupted
		- E.G. education, health care, fitness
	- accessibility.... no more being barred by physical geography
- Issues we should be vigilant about
	- more obvious: Privacy and security
		- now imagine 3d modeling a someone, using ai to generate his voice and personality, voila you got yourself a ghost!
		- Ok but how are they getting a full-body live image scan and projection? Because that’s insane and there’s no way the headset is doing that 
	- physical vulnerablility
		- Tech: “As the metaverse takes shape, consumers will likely require some kind of wearable hardware — such as smart glasses or headsets — to be fully immersed in the digital environment. Mainstream adoption of those connected devices will translate to an inevitable broadening of the attack surface, resulting in more vulnerabilities and opportunities for cyber attackers if not adequately secured.”
		- Human: "The dangers [of the metaverse] could increase exponentially as AR enters the picture, with users being potentially misdirected into a street or led into a dangerous physical situation like a robbery," says van Dalen.
		- 
	- less obvious: Context? lack of aura
		- E.G. going on a date. would it feel the same as IRL?
		- San Junipero and Striking Vipers
		- violent behavior? because it doesn't feel as "real"?

	- A monopolized metaverse becomes a privatized, financially maximizing reality: a Matrix where humans, plugged into their VR headsets, are harvested for data, status, and money. A [dystopian Metaverse](https://nwn.blogs.com/nwn/2021/08/neal-stephenson-metaverse-snow-crash-utopia-dystopia.html#more) is a digital reality without privacy, sanctuary, or freedom — the worst of the internet, strapped to your head. Already, Gucci purses in Roblox and CryptoPunks on Twitter suggest the beginnings of status hierarchies and financialization in the metaverse.

Microsoft Mesh seem like an artifact from the future, but it's based on a very present reality: the need for human interaction. This was accelerated by the pandemic, which forced everyone to collaborate online; despite all the benefits of remote work, [people missed each other](https://news.microsoft.com/innovation-stories/mesh-for-microsoft-teams/): remote meetings are impersonal, lacking the small real-life moments that colleagues cherished. Through mixed reality applications, Mesh brings this desired presence back into the virtual space.

If this device was successfully and widely adopted, it could help creates a future where we fully live in the [Metaverse](https://www.gather.town/post/why-the-metaverse-matters). Before, our locations would dictate our lives: work, education, love, etc. Now, we spend most of our lives on the Internet, interacting with users all over the globe. Imagine how much our online experiences could be transformed by presence. The Metaverse would create not only meaningful human connection, but also unprecedented access to opportunity. 

For instance, McKinsey states that [industries with the highest physical proximity are likely to be most disrupted](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/future-of-work/the-future-of-work-after-covid-19): healthcare, retail, education, etc. Opportunity would become more accessible for both customers and employees; the former could acquire world-renowned expertise while the latter could work abroad — all without leaving their homes. This would especially benefit those from developing countries, like the Philippines. For example, the web3 space is full of infinite learning opportunities, like attending workshops and contributing to projects. However, I struggle to make the most out of these because the space is very Eurocentric. It's difficult to network and collaborate with others because of my timezone and passport; even worse, the way I present myself online is limited to my avatar or video. Mesh would help me fully connect with others by making me more "real" to them.

However, despite all the benefits Mesh has to offer, I also worry that it could bring about a dystopian Metaverse: one that dehumanizes its users. Across various VR platforms, there've already been many incidents of degrading behavior, such as [racist insults](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/20/cto-racism-could-ruin-metaverse-if-tech-doesnt-improve-diversity-now.html) and [sexual harassment](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/12/16/1042516/the-metaverse-has-a-groping-problem/). Mesh's features can be unintentionally used for these nefarious purposes. A dystopian world  is also oppressive, surveilling their citizens through [corporate and technological control](https://libraryguides.mdc.edu/c.php?g=957851&p=6914808). A [monopolized Metaverse](https://reboothq.substack.com/p/metaverse) can exemplify this; Anthony Tan describes this as "...a privatized, financially maximizing reality...where humans...are harvested for data, status, and money." Mesh users would not only be giving Microsoft — a Big Tech corporation — money, but also all their behavioral data. How else can the device generate a lifelike photorealistic projection? And how can we be sure that this device won't record our experience while using it? Microsoft would end up upholding what Shoshana Zuboff calls [surveillance capitalism](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/24/opinion/sunday/surveillance-capitalism.html): a business model that endangers our privacy and democracy.

Overall, Mesh can only be ready for adoption if it is heavily evaluated by experts; otherwise, instead of circumventing inequalities, it would elevate them.


The Internet helped us expand beyond our local networks, connecting us with people all over the world; the Metaverse could build on this by enabling us to deeply engage with others, no matter the distance. 

The lack of resources pushes Filipinos to study/work overseas, a costly process only a few can afford.
