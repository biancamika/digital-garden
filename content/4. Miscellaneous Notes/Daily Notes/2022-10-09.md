> **Critical sociotechnical literacy:** an approach to [technology education]... that engages learners in the practices of critically reading their designed world by situating [technological] artifacts in the social, cultural, and historic contexts of their [development] in order to imagine new and future possibilities for community-centered [innovation]…


In this stage, the researcher will investigate how Filipinos perceive the future and technology (specifically the Internet), and how this perception shapes their approach to their work. Then, collected data will be processed into insights.
