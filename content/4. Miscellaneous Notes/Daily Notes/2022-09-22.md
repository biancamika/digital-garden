## PH Design
#design #culture #Filipino 
- Pancit as culture...pancit as design
- Design isn't just aesthetics... we have to think about its roots...
- There are 100+ kinds of pancit!
- We have the privilege to do research
- Food also counts as information! (What we eat, how we eat)...information that isn't necessarily passed down through publications, communications
- Issues with fusion cusine...because what cusine is not a fusion?
- Culture is not fixed/permanent...it is always evolving
- All of us have culture...we just don't pay attention to it
- Humanities/social sciences are seen as a means to enhance STEM...as if we're not our own fields...parang palabok
- Research isn't just found online...it can be found in books, in asking the makers...

### Significance of Pancit as Culinary Heritage
- Various dimensions
	- Agricultural: where does it come from? what's the environment it was made in..
	- Symbolic: what does it mean?
	- Historical: how did it get here? how did it get transferred...
	- Spiritual: same dimension as historical ^
	- Culinary: how do you cook the pancit?
	- Social: it means something when you have it as a community
	- Aesthetic: we pay attention to how we present it...whether it be a party or fine dining setting..
	- Economic: why is pancit so cheap and affordable? who eats pancit on a regular basos (which strata)
- **How can you probe the significance of (everyday) design through these dimensions?**
	- Culinary -> epistemic (knowledge)
		- education x philosophy
		- how do we get to know this subject on a deeper level?
	- Agricultural -> environmental
- The Jeep
	- Aesthetic: 
		- every jeepney is unique
		- Why is the jeepney small? Made for Filipino heights
	- Economic: 
		- public transport; lower to middle class
		- lengthened to accommodate more passengers
	- Historical: 
		- remade from jeepneys that were left behind by American troops 
		- how was it adopted from the American build?
	- Environmental: 
		- urban settings
		- attached a roof to protect them from the scorching Philippine heat
	- Symbolic: reflection of the Filipino spirit â€” resilient, innovative, and optimistic.
	- Epistemic: valued simplicity; not much changes; welding
	- Spiritual: 
		- Catholic imagery....imagery of what they find important...sports, national imagery
		- "God bless our trip"
