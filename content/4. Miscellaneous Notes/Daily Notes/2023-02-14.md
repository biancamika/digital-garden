### On Human Evolution and Speciation
- In the 1930 sci-fi classic Last and First Men by Olaf Stapledon, Homo sapiens undergoes drastic evolutionary processes throughout its history that ultimately results in no less than 17 descendant species, with the fourth of those onward being found on other planets, namely Venus and Neptune. Is this the future of our species? Are we even still evolving? Yes, we are still evolving. But not our species as a whole! 
- Remember that ==evolution works on the level of a **population**, which is a group of individuals living together.== Of course, our various modes of transportation complicate that definition and virtually prevent total isolation of any one human population, but the distinction is important. There have been several documented cases of human evolution, such as the following:
  - Tibetans, living in very high altitudes where there is less oxygen in the air, have more efficient oxygen-utilization mechanisms;
  - The Buriat tribe of very cold Siberia have wider than normal skulls at the forehead, which by virtue of resulting in a smaller surface area:volume ratio causes less heat to escape through the head;
  - Certain native African tribes develop a non-lethal form of sickle cell anemia that protects them from malaria;
  - Alpine dairy-farming communities in Europe have 1.0 frequency for the allele for lactase, allowing them to digest lactose in milk unlike most other people in the world;
  - The Bajau, who have been free diving for subsistence for a thousand years, have larger than average (as much 50% larger!) spleens, which recycle red blood cells and hold a reserve of blood.
- These are just a few of the most fascinating and well known examples. As the Bajau example shows you, ==these evolutionary trends can take a relatively short period of time.== 
  - Dairy-farming communities evolved the lactase gene in around 5,000 years. For a species that is only around 200,000 years old, it's important to note these quick evolutionary rates. 
  - Also take note that these are evolutionary events occurring independently in certain human populations; they are not all happening concurrently in all humans! That's what we mean by evolution working on the population level.
- There has been the question of whether or not the human species is still driven by natural selection the way other organisms are. 
  - Certainly, there are things we can do that other species can't in response to environmental change, such as locking ourselves in a well-stocked, air-conditioned bunker during a nuclear holocaust that will kill most other species. 
  - But as we've seen with the examples above, evolutionary pressures are still working on certain human populations. 
  - Many biologists speculate that disease may be the greatest evolutionary pressure molding our trajectory, with resistance to disease being selected for. This is very timely given the situation that we find ourselves in now.
- Now let's talk about [[Speciation]]. Recall: evolution and [[Speciation]] are NOT the same process. 
  - As we've seen with Biston betularia, evolution can happen without [[Speciation]]. The mutants of X-Men may be products of evolution but they're not necessarily a new species. 
  - Yes, humans are currently evolving but there is no evidence to suggest that any one human population is speciating. Recall: in order for speciation to occur, there should be reproductive isolation. Rarely is any human group so completely cut-off from the rest of humanity that such isolation can take place.

#### _The Time Machine_
- Our key reference for this topic is The Time Machine (1895) by H.G. Wells, which supposes that H. sapiens has evolved into two offshoot species: the Eloi and the Morlocks.
- In the timeless classic, the protagonist (simply called the Traveller), creates a time machine and with it zooms to the future, 802701 AD to be precise. At this time, it seems that H. sapiens as we know it no longer exists, at least in far-future London. 
  - (Who knows what the rest of the world looks like? As we have learned, it's populations that evolve, not entire species, so it's possible that there's still H. sapiens elsewhere on the globe.) 
- In London and probably throughout Great Britain, the pleasant, indolent Eloi live on the surface while the monstrous and cunning Morlocks live underground. Given the absence of H. sapiens, it's reasonable to suspect that both species are offshoots of humans, especially considering that 800,000 years is definitely enough time for speciation to have occurred, as long as there was sufficient reproductive isolation between the two formerly human populations.
- What could have caused this reproductive isolation? Obviously, it involved keeping one population of humans above the surface and casting away another population below the ground. 
  - Physically, the Eloi represent current humans much more closely than Morlocks do, and the novel makes it a point to emphasize how pretty they are compared to the grotesque, animalistic other. 
  - It's almost impossible not to have a Marxist reading of the book. The distinction between the two new species practically screams "class struggle!" 
  - The most obvious sign of this is the presence of the machines underground. Sometime in our future, capitalists force the laborers underground to drive the machinery that keeps the surface world going. 
  - And for the allopatric speciation scenario to work, this means that the laborers weren't just made to work down there and then be able to return to the surface when they're done with work; the Eloi ancestors forced them to stay there! Think miners, but they can't ever leave their place of work. Laws must have been put into place to prevent mixing of the two populations, which could have only meant a social milieu where it became unacceptable for the capitalist elite to interact with the lowly workers. Such a grim future! It's almost completely antithetical to the harmonious future that Star Trek envisions.
- The physical transformation of the subterranean humans into Morlocks over 800,000 years is typical of speculations on the evolution of animals that are bound to underground habitats. 
  - These animals are called troglobites (a similar word, troglodyte, has been used to refer to humans living in caves and has been co-opted by fantasy literature as a name for any sort of repulsive, barbaric creature, such as in Dungeons & Dragons). 
  - Typically, troglobites have evolved to have slow metabolism (likely an evolutionary response to the scarcity of food underground compared to above-ground), absence of pigmentation (colors being biologically costly to produce but not useful in caves, whether for display purposes or protection from ultraviolet radiation), and decrease or loss of sight, if not the eyes themselves (which do not fully develop). 
  - The cunning and aggression displayed by the Morlocks, which is atypical of cave denizens, is not surprising given that they are an offshoot of an intelligent species that has had to fight for survival. The cave creature in the excellent 2005 horror film The Descent is another good example of such a creature.
- In several ways, the Eloi as future human is even more frightening a concept, at least from a biological perspective. Here we have a species that still looks human and yet has lost many of the things that make a human human: strong emotional responses and drives. 
  - The Eloi is a lazy creature reduced to feeding and reproducing out of need, barely stimulated by external forces. In this way, it's easy to argue that Morlocks are even more human. 
  - Eloi seem to have lost even basic survival instincts, which most animals have! 
  - In Wells's view of the world, the capitalists' dependence on and harsh treatment of laborers dehumanizes them, perhaps not physically, but certainly behaviorally.
  - Honestly, it's difficult to speculate a future where humans reach this level of helpless complacency. Wells's future must have been absolutely utopic (at least above ground), with diseases and senescence and natural disasters a thing of the past, for natural selection to have bred out survival instincts and non-essential desires (which are admittedly energetically costly) from the surface humans! 
  - Anatomically speaking, the Eloi's limbic system (recall: it's the part of the brain that's involved in behavioral and emotional responses, including those critical to survival) is probably quite different from H. sapiens's. Whatever cataclysm caused the collapse of this society left a remnant of humanity (or of Brits, to be specific) that's but a shade of what humans used to be, unable (and even unwilling) to defend themselves against the Morlocks, who are now able to return to the surface.
