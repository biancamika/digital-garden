## Adobe Mentorship
#design #education #advice 
- John Piaget is the natural way
- potential pathways
	- UX design is not a field...so much more than the visual/surface level
	- you can do DEEP THINKING work
	- "I specialize in the type of design you can't see; you don't realize it's there but everything seems to be working"
		- E.G. Disneyland has no trash because throwing away trash is frictionless
	- takes a service design approach; not a service designer (requires journey maps, facilitation, etc.)
		- applies to airport security (how can you make people feel like they're not in prison?)
		- sees what he does as EXPERIENCE DESGIN
		- communicates this through a portfolio
		- People aren't looking for designers; they're looking for problem-solvers (craftsmen v.s. ARCHITECTS)
		- not just data...also the contextualization...
			- E.G. IDEO's Bodystorming
	- product management, product design, education
	- Look at companies that have bridges into the PH or into areas where it'd be easy for you to go and work... (e.g. multinationals like Deloitte and Accenture)
	- ^ think of these as STEPPING STONES...that'll help make you more viable...that could justify a H1-B
- Strategy is how people behave...and that's more design work
	- The trick: not just communicate the HOW and WHY...but also the outcome that will happen (most valuable)...this is tested pa
- Again, how to break in: What are the OPPORTUNITIES that are closer at hand....that could get me more opportunities?
	- Adobe internship program? Ask Adobe
- Another pathway: apply to graduate programs!
	- ideally they will fund your tuition....ideally full-ride
	- play the minority card
	- USA graduate program -> visa program
	- Einstein visa? O visa...for distinguished technologists
	- PhD doesn't pay off for work...just get masters?
- Or going to another country that doesn't have strict immigration rules....which will put in to a more privileged position
- think about doing this in STAGES....don't think about it in a hollywood way??

	- indiana is nice because you can kind of design your experience
- Recommendations (because of reputation)
	- The D School at Standard
	- Carnegie Mellon
		- two masters for design (art and interdisciplinary)
	- Georgia Tech
	- Indiana
	- University of Washington
	- UC Berkely 
- Programs
	- A lot of computer science programs are HCI
	- do you prefer research or hands-on designer...
		- if you prefer research....go for something with hardcore statistics
		- if you just focus on quali research...it'll be harder to find roles...you need a data-oriented approach
	- Interdisciplinary
		- ITP at NYU
		- CMU
		- D School
		- HCDE at UW
	- avoid programs that are just "UX Design"
		- no subject matter of its own
		- most of the foundational work has been done in social sciences: psychology, anthropology, sociology, behavioral economics, etc.
- Don't allow the outcome to become the goal
	- What's calling you to thsi work? What makes it interesting?
- "it's a marathon it's not a sprint"
- a bad economy is a great time to go back to school, because you're not missing anything
- On Finding a Specialty
	- late bloomer daw siya
	- got a mentor on the unspoken things: e.g. presenting yourself, telling your story....it's all STORYTELLING
	- even true stories are from a certain point of view. how you position that is your strategy
	- linkedin v.s. perosnal site
