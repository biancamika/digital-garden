## Historical and Philosophical Foundations of Education

### Education in Ancient Greece
#### Greece: Land of Heroes and Thinkers
- The mountainous terrains of Greece promoted the development of independent polis or city-states.  Two of these city-states are Sparta and Athens.  Knowing about the ideologies and way of life of the Spartans and Athenians can provide context about the educational system that developed in each city-state.

	- Later Athenian
		- Sophists
		- Plato
		- Socrates
		- Aristotle

#### Reflecting on Greek Education
> To synthesize what you've learned about Greek Education,
>**1.) Identify an issue that you think continues to challenge education** (locally or internationally) **today, that you recognize to also have been present in Greek Education** (any part of Greek education). 
>**2.) In** **approx. 3-5 sentences, share about how the issue was dealt with in Greek education** (Identifying the specific segment in Greek Education), **as well as what you think might have affected this.** Cite excerpts from the readings to qualify your statements (cited phrases not included in the 3-5 sentences).

One problem present in Greek Education (particularly the Late Athenian period) that still challenges us today is the emphasis of bookish and schoolroom tactics "...in which rote learning or memorization was superseding the activities of the earlier period." An example of this in our present times is the study of history; I can't help but think about how most of my history classes relied on memorization methods. Solutions to this problem were offered by one of the most prominent philosophers at the time: Socrates. One is informal education; "He believed in gaining knowledge through direct contct with people and by personal observation and experience. He felt that in such ways knowledge revealed itself through the soul."; the other is the Socratic method, which aimed to make students' aware of (and thus act on) their own ignorance. However, despite these methods being influential today, they weren't able to shape educational practices in Ancient Greece due to the selfish individualism of the populace; "The people as a whole, though superficially acquainteed with their teachings, were little influenced by them; while most of the nelightened and educated class were already throughly corrupted... The lack of ethical standards developed by this individualistic education ultimately brought the Athenians to ruin."


- problems
	- education's emphasis on memory (e.g. drills, lectures)
		- "Education tended to emphasize bookish and schoolroom tactics, in which rote learning or memorization was superseding the activities of the earlier period."
	- I believe this can still be present in our schools today...I can't help but think about how much of my historical education consisted of memorization
- solution
	- the intellectual training that developed during the late Athenian period e.g. Socratic method....ensures that the student is critically thinking
	- revival of activity method

### Summary of Module 1
- **CONTEXT SHAPES PURPOSE**
	- One of the initial patterns that we have began to explore in module 1 was how the context of an era shaped the purpose of education - ex. how China's geography led it its aim of "self-preservation" - or how the beliefs of the various eras in ancient greek society led to different perspectives about the aim of education. 
	- As you reflect on your own teaching philosophy, think about today's context? ==How does your own personal vision of what education is for grounded in the needs of today's context?==
- **PURPOSE SHAPES PRACTICE**
	- Another pattern we began to see was how the aim of education affected the types and methods of education. If you look at institutions today, I think we can continue to say the same thing - for example, schools like Ateneo who continues to put to forefront being a person for others encourage reflection about society and one's role in our courses.
