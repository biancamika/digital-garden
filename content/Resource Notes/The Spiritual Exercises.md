## Annotations
### Annotation 23
*The following is an excerpt of the annotation right before First Week of the Spiritual Exercises of St.  Ignatius of Loyola with a contemporary translation by David Fleming, SJ.*

> The goal of our life is to live with God forever. God, who loves us, gave us life. Our own response of love allows God’s life to flow into us without limit.
> 
> All the things in this world are gifts of God, presented to us so that we can know God more easily and  make a return of love more readily.
> 
> As a result, we appreciate and use all these gifts of God insofar as they help us develop as loving persons. **But if any of these gifts become the center of our lives, they displace God and so hinder our  growth toward our goal.** In everyday life, then, we must hold ourselves in balance before all of these created gifts insofar as we have a choice and are not bound by some obligation. We should not fix our desires on health or sickness, wealth or poverty, success or failure, a long life or a short one. For  everything has the potential of calling forth in us a deeper response to our life in God.
> 
> Our only desire and our one choice should be this: **I want and I choose what better leads to God’s deepening his life in me.**

### Annotation 316
**Consolation:** “every increase in hope, faith, and charity, and every interior joy which calls and attracts one toward heavenly things and to the salvation of one’s soul, by bringing it tranquility and peace in its Creator and Lord.”

### Annotation 317
**Desolation:** “obtuseness of soul, turmoil within it, an impulsive motion toward low and earthly things, or disquiet from various agitations and temptations. These move one toward lack of faith and leave one without hope and without love. One is completely listless, tepid, and unhappy, and feels separated from our Creator and Lord.”
