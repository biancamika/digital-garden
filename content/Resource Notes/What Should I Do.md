## Notes
### Description
Your **third required reading** is a synthesis of the concepts of Ignatian discernment in an easy-to-read, relatable, yet sound and accurate way.

Pay attention to the following in the reading:
-   How does Martin explain Ignatian indifference?
-   How does consolation and desolation work?
-   Is it possible to change a decision we have made in discernment?

### Lecture Notes
- There are three times/situations where you make a decision
	- **First Time**
		- utter clarity
		- undoubtedly the right decision
		- not as intense values
		- clear to you from the very beginning
	- **Second Time**
		- authentic good v.s. apparent good
		- consolation and desolation need to be observed
	- **Third Time**
		- all great/good
		- more than one option
		- best option needs to be discerned
		- Two methods for approaching the Third Time:
			- First reason
				- Emphasis on reason
				- Desires
				- Praying for indifference
				- Setting objectives
				- Pros and cons
			- Second reason
				- Emphasis on imagination
				- Giving advice to a stranger
				- Looking at your choices from deathbed
				- Final judgement
				- Ask your best self what you would do
