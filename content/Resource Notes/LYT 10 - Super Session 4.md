	- Emergent
		- How emergence happens: notes turn into constellations 
		- spark-driven; serendipitious 
		- Workflow suggestions
			- The Daily Spark & The Weekly Arc
			- First Light / Last Light
	- Progressive
		- an idea grows over time
		- can be linear and non-linear
		- Workflow suggestion: highlights to insights
	- Tension-resolving
		- Often being able to resurface ideas in context to ignite ideation. How? Through placeholder tags and notes, along with special dataviews
		- Cognitive scaffolding & resurfaced ideas in context
		- Workflow suggestion: map-making
	- Output-driven
		- having the end in mind: a deliverable for work, or a thing to share
		- Workflow suggestion: share something

- Sensemaking Workflows
	- Note-making and Note-mapping
	- The Daily Spark and The Weekly Arc
	- Highlights to Insights
	- First Light to Last Light
		- basically the first  moments v.s. last moments of your day
- You can't have emergence if you don't have dots to connect

## Exercise 4
> Which of the sensemaking workflows resonates the most with you? Why?

I've been using Obsidian as my PKM since 2020, so it's been interesting seeing how my sensemaking workflow has developed over time. At first, I was doing a **Highlights to Insights** workflow since I was trying the Zettlekasten approach. While I still use this workflow whenever I'm in the research stage of writing something, it became quite unsustainable for me over time (I'm planning to integrate Readwise with my Obsidian soon, though, so let's see if that helps). Right now, I'd say that the sensemaking workflows that resonate the most with  me is **The Daily Spark** (no Weekly Arc), since I do most of my note-taking in Daily Notes. But after LYT, I think I'll start doing **Note-making and Note-mapping** more; this way, I'll be able to draw insights out of my notes instead of  clumping everything into long documents.
