## Notes

**What does God have to do with discernment?** If we don't answer this question, we will end up staying with the many misconceptions we have about God, many of which we've had since we were kids.

### [The Flying Spaghetti Monster and Why the Atheists are Right (Is God a being?)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_hzyCFHh1o)
- Misconception: **God is a divine being.**
- Satirical religion: Pastifarians
	- Started to protest the teaching of intelligent design
	- Point here: there are a lot of misconceptions from both religious and non-religious people about God. What these all have in common? God as a mythical creature
		- Is God somewhere floating in space?
- What exactly do we mean by God?
- Reality: **[[God is not a being]].**
	- Being: *(Latin: ens)* An existing **thing** in the universe.
		- Thing = something observable
- Why do Greek gods have elements associated with them? Because these are elements that occur in the world, and are unstable, just like the gods in the stories.
	- The Greek gods are the Ancient Greeks' way of explaining the fickleness and at the same time the power of the elements that surround them.
- **Common Misconceptions About God**
	- Big Brother
	- Lawgiver
	- Puppet Master
- Dr. Stephen Bullivant: The "Most True God" transcends natural attributes and does not require appeasement.
- **Does God exist?**
- Atheists are right in saying that God **does not exist** because there is no evidence of God. But quite often, they refer to God as just **one more being** (existing thing) in the universe.
- **God exists, but not as one being among many beings.** He exists in a different way. So how can we explain his existence?

### [Aristotle and Amorsolo (Misunderstanding God Less)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwPHMpubG44)

- How do you understand something?
	- You understand something when you *get* it.
	- *"Gets!"*
- **To understand means that you are able to grasp something within the confines of ==what you know
	- To grasp something means that you have some form of control over it. By knowing it, you control it. You control the truth by being able to articulate it.
- The point here is not to understand God...but it's to miusunderstand God less.
- Two main points
	- God enables existence to take place. ([[God is the condition of possibility that enables all other beings to exist]])
	- God is both beyond and within our experience.
- Aristotle: "You can come to grasp anything in the world according to four causes."
	- Material cause: "that out of which" it is made.
	- Efficient Cause: the source of the objects principle of change or stability.
	- Formal Cause: the essence of the object.
	- Final Cause: the end/goal of the object, or what the object is good for. *(telos)*
	- ![[images/The Four Causes of Aristotle.png]]
	- Focus on 3rd cause: who made the statue?
- Every thing has an efficient cause (a.k.a. where that thing came from). But all things must have emerged from a ==**first cause**== that itself has no cause (an uncaused first cause).
- God is not an object in the world, not even the greatest or highest instance of existing things. **God is the ==condition of possibility== that enables things to exist.**
- St. [[Thomas Aquinas]]: **God is *ippum esse subsistens* (the very act of be-ing itself)** 
- St. Augustine of Hippo: God is...
	- Transcendent (beyond our experience)
	- Immanent (within our experience)
- Fernando Amorsolo
	- Despite never having met Amorsolo IRL, we can get a sense of his essence through his paintings.
	- Similarly, despite not having a direct experience of God, but we can experience him indirectly -- through what he creates.
- St. Augustine of Hippo: *"Si comprehendis non est deus"* (If you understand, then it is not God).
- All of this is related to [[PHILO 12 MOC]] under Aurelio
