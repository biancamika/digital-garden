[[LYT 10 MOC]]

## The NoMA Method
- NoMa: note-making
- sharpens your thinking, gives you intellectual assets
- What most of us are not doing: externalizing our ideas...this is what we want to improve on
- Note-taking
	- quickly captured
	- other people's thoughts
	- FOMO mentality
	- easy in, easy out
- Note-making
	- mindfully made 
	- your words
	- active
	- JOMO
	- mindfully in, mindfully out
- Note-making is the act of investing in yourself.
	- It gives you linkable assets, which can easily become intellectual assets.
- Sometimes it's clear why you're note-making...but just as often, it's not clear. You feel the spark and you want to go towards that.
- NoMa: a way to make insights in minutes last a lifetime
- How to NoMa (related to [[Permanent Notes/ACE Thought-Weaving Framework]])
	- Be a "thing finder": notice anythjing; "Hmm..."
	- Connect... "That reminds me of..."
	- "Because..."
- How to build these assets? Make a note and link it
- "The best time to plant an idea is yesterday. The next best time to plant is now."
- The more general, the more difficult for topics
- Make a **connection** to form an **expression**
	- Which resonate: synthesize, shape, develop, assemble

## Takeaways
- **MOCs ground and orient your thinking efforts**
	- Whenever you feel that you are floating aimlessly, tether yourself to an existing MOC, or anchor yourself to a new one
- **Develop your PKM intuitions with link-based tools**
	- Working with tools that allow us to easily link ideas helps us build up a new intution that says, *"I'm feeling uncomfortable with this topic"*
	- That's the [[Mental Squeeze Point]]. Try to be aware of how that feels
	- An excellent solution to this is the MOC.
- **Expect to change your notes**
	- Just like re-titling, refactoring a note's content (i.e. *rewriting and restructuring*) is a core part of developing your knowledge over time.
- **MOCs allow for both top-down and bottom-up**
	- **Bottom-up:** You are naturally growing notes and to overcome a [[Mental Squeeze Point]], you create an MOC.
	- **Top-down:** You know a certain topic is important to you, even if you don't know what to add to it right now. Create a new MOC and drop a few words to Future You.
	- **Middle-out:** You use an MOC as a thinking tool.
