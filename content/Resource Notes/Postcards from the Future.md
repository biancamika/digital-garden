## Highlights
- Pre-study: desk research and interviews
- Design postcards based on data
- Research through design:  participants critically assess these postcards
	- 1. Postcards are all shown; students pick one that strikes them and react to it
	- 2. Holding workshops: participants fill up a postcard, then are prompted to “imagine scenarios for the fictional world and think about critical issues related to the fiction”
- Maybe my thesis website can hold such snapshots of the future, then people react to them?
	- First in a closed beta workshop like setting
	- Then in public (but how would they comment on it? Is it better if social media na lang? Ewan ko…maybe something like the Declaration of Interdependence website, where people write their own declarations)
- Qualitative content analysis
