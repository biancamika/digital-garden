title: "Demand Curve - Introduction to Value Props"
---
## What you'll learn
- How to identify the value props for your product/service.
-  How to turn those value props into the foundation of your ad copy.

## Why is it important?
- The most compelling copy on the planet does you no good if you're not conveying your value propositions ("value props" for short).
- You’re _proposing_ to someone the ways they’ll “get value” from your product.
- Without clearly identified value props, you risk attracting the wrong customers and delivering the wrong message.

## Overview
- Before you sit down to write copy, you need to know what to focus on. This is where value props come into play.
- From now on, you can think about value props as _copy ideas._ Whenever you’re stuck for copy ideas, revisit your value props.
- Your first step to creating effective social ads and landing pages is to identify value props: ==What does your product do to improve the lives of your target audience?‌==

## Developing value props
### Step 1: Identify your value props
- To identify your product or service value props, create a 3-column chart.
- Here’s the process:
	1.  List ==all the **_bad (non-desirable) alternative_** solutions== people resort to when they don't have you. And describe what makes each one bad. 
		1. For example, if they don't have your _fast_ car, they have to get to work in a slow car. What makes that bad is how much more time you waste in traffic. Or less time spent with your family.
	2. With each bad alternative, write ==one **_value prop_**== that highlights how your product offers a better solution to improve on that bad alternative. 
		1. For example, your fast car _gets you to work quickly_. The value prop wording should encapsulate the main high-level idea. Don't worry too much about the details yet (we'll dive into that later). For example, the value prop could be "fastest consumer car ", and not "X horsepower".
	3. Finally, list a ==lucrative **_customer persona_**== in a third column: identify the persona that cares most about this particular value prop. And bullet point the top two reasons why they care about it.
- Examples of value props:
	- For a fantasy football (soccer) app: ![[images/Fantasy Soccer App Value Props.png]]
	- For an online matcha shop: ![[images/Online Matcha Shop Value Props.png]]
- You may walk away with a bunch of value props at first. This is good. It’s always easier to subtract than to add. Once you feel you’ve exhausted your options, you’ll want to reduce your list of value props in column two to those that are most appealing to your top personas.‌
- The leftover value props will be the focus of your ads.
- Ideally, you'll walk away with ==at least five value props== to build ad copy from.

### Step 2‌: Identify the problems your value props solve
- Now that you've identified your value props, it's time to refine them so that they serve as a foundation for your ad copy. To do this for our clients, we use a spreadsheet to flesh them out.
- Continuing from our examples:
	- Fantasy soccer app: ![[images/Fantasy Soccer App Problems.png]]
	- Online matcha shop: ![[images/Online Matcha Shop Problems.png]]
- ‌First, it’s important to remember that ==you want to use the language your audience would use.== This is where customer surveys become invaluable.‌
- Second, ==skip the jargon== (exception: if you’re in a super-niche market, it’s sometimes OK to use industry jargon).
- When you fill out this spreadsheet, ==do it as though you were speaking directly to your audience.==
- Begin by listing out the value props you’ve identified in the left-hand column. Then, fill out the following columns:
#### Problem
- Get super specific about ==the moment== your target audience has **urgently experienced the problem**. This should be written in ==past tense.‌==
- This is especially important if you're a B2B product.
	- Most often, the problem involves ==wasting substantial time or money.==
	- Some examples:
		-   Your company just lost a lot of money
		-   A key employee just quit
		-   A relationship just got ruined
- If you're B2C, you might be a "vitamin" instead of a "painkiller". ==This means there might not be a burning problem to solve.== That's OK. ==Focus on the solution and benefits section more.==
- At Demand Curve, we’ll sometimes _get on the phone and talk to each other_ as if we were a member of our target audience. We interview each other to flesh out the pain and urgency we feel.
#### Implications
- Drill into the bad things that happen if someone hits that problem.
- What happens _after_ the key employee quits? What _can't you do_ because you're wasting tons of time? Does your company risk going out of business? Do you fear for your job?
- We call this "twisting the knife". ==Once you've found an entry point with the problem, drill into that pain more and more.==
- As you write out the implications of the problem, ==find the specific person whose butt is on the line when things fail.== Get super specific, down to the job title. They should be losing massive amounts of money, time, or reputation.
- **Examples:**
	- If your company loses a lot of money, people are going to get fired. Which means your job as the VP of Finance is at stake.
	-   If your key employee quits, it's going to take months to retrain a new hire. And that costs $80,000.
	-   If you're wasting 20 hours a week on meaningless tasks, you can't ship as quickly. Which means that, as the CEO, you're going to miss investor goals and lose funding.

#### Solution
- How your product solves the problem.
- **Examples:**
	- Ruby Plants uses machine learning to grow plants
	-   Our feedback tool keeps track of employees who are flight risks
	-   Sentry integrates with every type of codebase
#### Benefits
- Flip the implications of the problem around and talk about the _great things that naturally come from the solution_.‌
- **Example copy:**
	-  Growing plants with machine-learning makes them _five times cheaper_. So you save money.
	-  Keep employees around. Saving you months of time hiring and training.
	-   When every codebase can integrate, you don't write any custom code. So you have time to push new features.

## Don'ts / Common Pitfalls
### Implications that aren't tied to the problem
- ‌For example, if your customer's problem is "you just missed your taxi", an implication is _not_ "you always miss your taxis." That's a separate problem and value prop.
- An implication _would_ be "you missed an important sales meeting" — which missing your taxi directly caused.‌
### Avoid industry-wide trends
- Don't use language like "80% of office managers don't know about plant-based snacks" or "AI hasn't reached farming yet". That's not a specific problem that your customer faces.
- Instead, talk about your customer. For example, "your key employee just had an allergic reaction to gluten" or "you have thousands of workers manually checking your chicken eggs."
