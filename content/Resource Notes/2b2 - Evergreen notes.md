title: "2b2 - Evergreen notes"
---
- Note-takers "churn and burn" through their notes. 
	- They take them for a specific short-term ("just-in-time") purpose—like a test or a project. 
	- When the milestone concludes, the notes lose their value. 
	- This type of note-taking doesn't accumulate long-term value.  
- Note-makers "know and grow" with their knowledge. 
	- Instead of having value evaporate from their short-term notes, note-makers create **living notes** that are able to grow in value and evolve over time.  
   
Let's overly simplify this difference with a table:
| Note-taking                      | Note-making                     |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Passive thinking                | Active thinking                  |
| "Churn and burn"              | "Know and grow"             |
| Static & permanent notes | Living & evergreen notes |


- In the late 1950s, Niklas Luhmann didn't have a computer. But he had plenty of index cards. Whenever he read something notable, he would write it on an index card. Decades later, Luhmann had ≈100,000 index cards that he used to write 400 articles and 60 books.   
- People are rightfully impressed by how prolific he was with his "Zettelkasten" method. So they try to replicate it in the digital world. 
	- But as always happens, some folks get a little too dogmatic and they rigidly tie themselves to the "One True Zettelkasten Method"—bending over backwards trying to digitize what Niklas Luhmann did with index cards.
- What could go wrong?  Zettelkasten zealots are likely to experience two pitfalls in their PKM efforts:
	- Making **atomic notes** that are too tiny = fragmented thinking.
	- Thinking that their "**permanent notes**" can't change = rigid thinking.
- A subtle but important distinction to the term "permanent notes" (which is NOT a term from Luhmann by the way) came around 2019 when Andy Matuschak coined the term **evergreen notes**. For many, including myself, evergreen notes suggest that ==notes are living and changeable.== 
- When we make evergreen notes, we make living notes—notes that can grow in value and evolve over time. **_If notes can't evolve and make new connections, they won't be as valuable to us._**

## Make evergreen notes
While evergreen notes are just regular notes, they have principles that generate value.
- **Clear and concise** - The title for evergreen notes should be a ==clear title or statement. ==
    - As you form this one-liner, you clarify and sharpen your thinking. It’s like a ==mini-thesis.== This process naturally enforces an ==atomic note size.==
    - Don't stress about making atomic notes. Follow the Goldilocks rule: Not too short, not too long.
    - You will know if it's too long ==if you have trouble linking it because it's saying many different things.==
- **Your own words** - Writing in your own words forces you to deeply think about what you’re trying to say.
    - This is a forcing function to draw out your unique perspective. 
- **Linked** - Your living, evergreen notes should have links to other notes. 
    - You will naturally make links if you’ve made clear notes in your own words.
- **Non-static** - As you encounter new things in life, you can ==re-write or re-factor your notes== to capture more meaning and value.
    - This means evergreen notes become ==living entities==—gaining insights and complexity as time passes.
