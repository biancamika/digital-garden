title: "Demand Curve - How to Charge"
---
- Your pricing structure is **how you charge for your products or services.** We’ll cover the five most common and effective ones below. Once we’ve gone over them, we'll give you guidance on how to select the model that makes the most sense for your business.
- Since pricing for physical products is pretty obvious, we’ll just briefly touch on it. With a few exceptions—e.g., consumables like monthly coffee delivery—physical products charge per product.
- The focus here is on pricing for intangible products/services, so if you’re in the physical-product realm, you can probably skip ahead to the next page.
- Two rules of thumb when it comes to pricing structure:
	1.  **Keep your pricing simple.** There’s a reason why tiered pricing usually has a max of four tiers—more than that could overwhelm the buyer. ==Don’t add friction to the buying process by making the conversion point too complex.==
	2.  **Don’t innovate for the sake of being different.** If your industry has a standard pricing structure, you could introduce friction if you try something totally different. If an innovative revenue model is a core part of your business concept, then your pricing will look different from most. But most startups don’t need to invent a new model—at least not at this stage. Instead of focusing on innovation, ==aim for efficiency, low risk, and high growth potential.==
## Pricing structures
- Below are five standard pricing structures. As you’ll see, there can be overlaps between them.
- Note: We don’t include freemium here because we think of it as ==part of a product and acquisition strategy, not a revenue model.== It’s a way to acquire and convert customers, but it’s outside the scope of how and what they pay for (i.e., a pricing model). We’ll go over freemium later, in “Pricing: Bonus Tactics."

| Usage-based           | Charging for customers’ use of or transactions with your product        | -   Companies that use value metrics typically double their growth rate vs. flat-fee or feature-based tier pricing <br/> - Aligns your pricing with your value props—and what your customers get value from <br/> - Low friction—initial cost to the user is low | - Requires significant data <br/> - Risky if you get it wrong <br/> - Potential taxi-meter effect <br/> - Can make revenue projection less predictable                                                                                          |
| Tiered                | Multiple pricing tiers                                                  | -   Often much simpler to start with than non-tiered usage-based pricing (needs less data) <br/> - Encourages upgrading once a user is hooked in the product but reaches the limit of their tier <br/> - Effective way to highlight a rich feature set           | - Compared to non-tiered usage-based pricing, less revenue potential <br/> - Could introduce friction by requiring a tier decision at purchase <br/> - Different tiers’ perceived values are set against each other                             |
| Flat-rate             | One price per product/service for all buyers                            | -   Simplicity <br/> - Transparency—easy to communicate <br/> - Avoids “subscription fatigue”                                                                                                                                                                    | -   Doesn’t factor in cohorts or personas <br/> - Can have high initial friction, e.g., if there’s a sizable upfront cost                                                                                                                       |
| Per-user              | A subscription type that charges per user or seat                       | -   Simplicity, for low friction <br/> - Transparency <br/> - Revenue projection is more predictable than with usage-based pricing                                                                                                                               | -   If separate seats don’t add value to the end user, per-user pricing isn’t aligned with product value—which could mean reduced revenue and lower conversion rates <br/> - Doesn’t factor in cohorts or personas <br/> - Seats can get shared |
| Variable              | Pricing that varies depending on factors like buyer-seller negotiations | -  Flexibility, especially if your costs are variable per customer                                                                                                                                                                                               | -   Lack of transparency <br/> - Adds complexity to your sales team's job, and adds to their workload <br/> - Risk of inefficiency                                                                                                              |
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
### Usage-based pricing
- **What it is:** Charging for customers’ use of or transactions with your product. ==The more a customer uses it, the more they pay.==
	- Usage-based pricing is considered ==the gold standard for startups.== It uses your value metric and therefore has the most direct connection between a product’s value and its price.
	- It can be a type of subscription, but isn’t always.
- **Who it’s for:** [OpenView Partners](https://openviewpartners.com/blog/2021-state-of-usage-based-pricing/#.Yae7mC-B3u0) did a survey of about 600 SaaS companies in 2021, and they found that 45% had usage-based pricing—up from 34% in 2020. It’s increasingly becoming the SaaS _true_ standard, in addition to being the _gold_ standard.
- Usage-based pricing is especially effective for products that have built-in stickiness and repeatable, consistent usage. Customers wouldn’t one-and-done a business like Square, so it makes sense for them to charge per transaction.
- Although we recommend a usage-based approach generally, it doesn’t always make the most sense for startups. If your startup is very young, you might not have enough data to know the value of your metric. You might need to start out with a different structure (you can always switch over).
- We’ll get into metric value more in How Much to Charge, and we’ll go over how to get data in the project for this module. But for now, here are two hypotheticals of what we mean by insufficient data:

### Tiered-pricing

### Flat-rate pricing

### Per-user pricing

### Variable pricing
