title: "Demand Curve - What is Growth"

[[Demand Curve Growth MOC]]
>_"A startup is a company designed to grow fast. ... The only essential thing is growth. Everything else we associate with startups follows from growth. ... You have to know that growth is what you're after. The good news is, if you get growth, everything else tends to fall into place. Which means you can use growth like a compass to make almost every decision you face."_[](http://www.paulgraham.com/growth.html)

- Growth: _the output_ from executing specific marketing activities.
	- Growth is an output. 
	- It’s the **Master Output** that we measure using two important benchmarks: ==revenue and customers.==
- If revenue and customers are growth outputs, what are the inputs? The inputs are the ==marketing tactics and strategies== you're going to learn in this program. 
	- Think of these tactics as levers that control a big machine. If you pull them in the wrong order, the machine isn't going to do what you need it to do. 
	- But when you get them right, you'll build a growth engine that will consistently get you more customers and increase your revenue.
- Throughout this program, you're going to learn what each lever does and which ones you should be pulling.
	- E.G. Let's say you think your company should be running Facebook ads. Before committing to that channel, you'll need to understand the inputs of that activity (money, time, resources) and the desired outputs (more revenue and customers).
	- Once you understand the underlying mechanics of how growth works, you'll realize that there are far fewer ways to grow a company than most people think. The strategies you'll learn in this program will allow you to generate results, regardless of the industry, country, or size of your startup.
- The type of growth you're going to learn throughout this program is strategic, experimental, and logical.
- Growth is **not** about:
	- Jumping from one tactic to another in search of a spike in traffic or revenue
	- Spreading your limited resources thin across multiple strategies and channels
	- Frantically rushing to a new strategy or channel because others are getting results
- Growth is **not** about being reactive. **Growth is about being proactive and putting your effort toward activities that are proven to align with your business model, market, brand, and product.**
