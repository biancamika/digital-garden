## Notes
Your **fourth required reading** discusses **attachment**, which is a serious obstacle from good discernment, and how to counter it with **detachment**.

Margaret's book _Inner Compass: An Invitation to Ignatian Spirituality_ deals, among other things, with the issue of attachments and learning how to detach from them in order for one to make a sound discernment.

### Reflection Questions
-   Why does Silf call attachment as "being hooked?" What does being "hooked" do to a person?
-   What does our deepest desire have to do with detachment? (Take note of the difference between the _stick way_ versus the _carrot way_.)
-   Describe the difference between the Strategy of Enslavement versus the Strategy of Liberation.
