title: "2a2 - The time value of ideas"

> You have a choice: Get $100 today, or $100 in 12 months. Which do you choose?

Most people choose "today".  Why is that?  
  
According to the **"time value of money"**, ==money you have today is worth more than the same amount in the future== because of the following reasons:
1. **Certainty**: You get the money. There are no guarantees in life, so waiting for the exact same amount doesn't make sense.
2. **Optionality**: You can use the money.
3. **Leverage**: You can leverage the money to make more money. (And if you don't, inflation will eat into the $100, making it worth less in a year's time.)

The same principles apply to **ideas**.

According to the **"time value of ideas"**, ideas you develop today are worth more than the same ideas you might develop in the future because of the same reasons:  
1. **Certainty**: You get the idea. (Just clipping articles seems like a safe way to "get" the idea, but what you are really getting is ==tremendous noise filling your system.==)
2. **Optionality**: You can use the idea. A dynamic network of emerging ideas can help future-proof YOU to the randomness of life.
3. **Leverage**: You can leverage the idea to make more insights. That's how note-_making_ gives you immediate value—==you get to leverage new ideas you deeply understand within a dynamic network of thought to build and connect with other emergent ideas.==
