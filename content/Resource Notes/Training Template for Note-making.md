title: "Training Template for Note-making"
---
## Prompt
- ðŸ—º Create a new note calledÂ **Concepts MOC**.
    - Make a list of 10-20 THINGS that you find interesting.
- ðŸŒ±Â **_Create your notes_**Â _(this is the 1st C of note-making)_.
    - From your list, choose 5 of your things.
    - Create those 5 things into new notes.Â 
- ðŸ§© In each note, paste the the following prompts:

## Template
This template takes you through the 7 C's of note-making:

1. Create (C1)
2. Connect (C2)
3. Clarify (C3)
4. Color (C4)
5. Critique (C5)
6. Cite (C6)
7. Curate (C7)

This is a training template. I don't normally use this template. I sometimes revisit it to get reminded of valuable prompts. If you are new to note-making, here is how you should treat it:

1. At first, use it. It is like training wheels on a bike.
2. Get comfortable with note-making. Then stop using it.
3. As needed, revisit it for helpful reminders of valuable prompts.
