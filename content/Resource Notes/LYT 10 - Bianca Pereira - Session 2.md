## Topic: Processing the Literature
- Why do we need sources?
	- Provenance: from source to idea...tracing the path
		- our ideas aren't original
	- Strengthens our arguments
		- We use multiple documents to support an idea
		- "We read 10 papers to write one sentence"
- Sea of Uncertainty: we are swimming in information all around us
- If you only have a few productive hours in a day...how do you use it? Consuming, collecting, or creating? We do all
	- How can we make this more balanced? (compared to just mostly consuming)
	- One solution... do less? No, do it ==more efficiently==
- First...how can we search for good quality sources?
- Recall: The PKM Pyramid, PKM Mindsets. How do we waste our time?
	- 1st Mindset: Not all sources (equally) matter...
		- Having a To-Read Later List is overwhelming and time-consuming
		- To solve this, create a ==High Pass Filter==
		- Have an ==Anti-Library==: a collection of all the books you haven't read
			- Remember...we only want the high quality stuff. Move the high quality stuff from the Antilibrary to your actual library
	- 2nd Mindset: Notes as pieces of understanding
		- Problem: We tend to take the wrong notes. 
			- Three different notes
				- Summary notes
					- say what the author said or say how it's relevant to your work
					- good for annotated bibliography
					- bad for personal knowledge management
				- Highlight notes
					- Highlights, then personal commentary/thoughts
					- Problem: you can end up highlighting everything...no focus
					- good for processing understanding
					- bad for personal knowledge management
				- Idea notes
					- Highlights become PART of the idea notes
					- Good for processing your understanding and personal knowledge management
					- Bad for source summarization
		- Pieces of Truth v.s. Pieces of Understanding 
			- Truth: (only) other people's words, static, published by others
			- Understanding: your ideas, grow over time, your words (mostly)
				- This is the goal for our notes
		- We don't just write notes about the literature. We write notes about ==our understanding== of the literature.
