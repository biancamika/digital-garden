The prompts that resonated most with me came from the producer and the researcher. Here are some of my responses:

**What does "achievement" look like in your work?**
In its most successful form, my work would be like a tapestry. I love being able to interweave different topics together into a form that anyone can process and appreciate (e.g. essay, video, artwork). 

**Where are you encountering things that spark/resonate?**
I am the type of person who can find inspiration anywhere...perhaps because I'm always open to it? I encounter things in my university classes, my online content stream (e.g. newsletters, RSS, Twitter), books, etc. 


I spend most of my time in my PKM note-taking. I mainly take notes to process lessons from university classes and synthesize research for long-form writing. However, my note-taking is very disorganized; majority of my notes are long daily notes that could be broken down into more atomic ones. This is also where I'm getting stuck; I just find it so time-consuming to process my notes.
I want to make this kind of note-taking (i.e. small, interconnected notes) more natural to me.
