In the past, to manage our files, we had a rigid folder-only system. As files became faster, we started calling them notes. Now, instead of mainly relying on folders, many of us rely more on links. That's because the rigid folder-only system we all grew up with is stunting our ability to deftly, to masterfully, work with our knowledge. Whereas, link-based notes allow us to do just that.  
  
So how can we become more masterful at using links? It starts with understanding what is happening beneath the surface.  
  
As we use links in our notes, interesting patterns start to form.  
  
These patterns follow “**systems theory** 🧩”.  
  
So before we jump too deeply into **"[[Permanent Notes/Idea Emergence]]"** we must define the terms of **[[Systems Thinking]]**.  
  

-   **Emergence** refers to the ==existence or formation of collective behaviors== — what parts of a system do together that they would not do alone.
    -   Emergence is adding complexity.
    -   Emergence is when the new whole is greater than the sum of its parts.
    -   If I was alone in a room, but now I am talking with friends, we are at a higher level of complexity. 
        -   Me alone equals Emergence Level 1
        -   Me with friends equals Emergence Level 2

---

-   **Complexity** is basically ==how many units of information we're looking at in a given system.== For notes, more links usually means more complexity.
-   **Divergence** is basically when things become unique.
-   **Convergence** is basically when things become unified.

Yes I know, there is more to it than that, but that's all the primer we need to understand **[[Permanent Notes/Idea Emergence]]**.

PS: Throughout this unit, we will balance "theory" with "practice". Getting more reps and tacking back and forth many times—_theory-practice-theory-practice_—_learn-do-learn-do_—will allow us to become skilled in this form of thinking we call "**Fluid Thinking**".
