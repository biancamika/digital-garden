## Notes
### Abstract
> Fostering humility in those who feel themselves already oppressed may in fact shrivel the soul's capacity for creative engagement with the world. A preoccupation with the limitations of one's personal or social situation can even lead to a form of spiritual self-destruction. A more positive approach to humility involves the gracious acceptance of God-given values found not only in one's own life and social class but also in potentially competing individuals and classes as well.
