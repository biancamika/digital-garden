title: "1c8 - Building relationships with queries"
---
- After you have a bunch of notes, you can strategically use queries to help you see your notes in a special way.  
- A **query** is a ==request for special results (or actions).==  
- For the scope of this workshop, we will call "queries that provide auto-updating lists" eitherÂ **"data views" or "**Â **data scopes**Â ðŸ”¬".  
- **Data views**Â are specific views created to slice, dice, filter, review, and analyze the information you are accreting.Â   
- Data views are not for active, generative thinking (that's where MOCs thrive). The value of data views come from ==how they passively provide you with updated views of information that you can analyze or act on; but they are worthless without putting meaningful context around them.==Â   
	- Use MOCs to generate insights
	- Use data views to analyze information
- Using queries to build data scopes is an advanced action. But many people want to learn becauseâ€”in sage handsâ€”queries are crazy-powerful.
