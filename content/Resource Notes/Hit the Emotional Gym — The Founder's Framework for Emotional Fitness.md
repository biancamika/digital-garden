### Highlights
> Anhalt worked to dig deeper by conducting an interpretive phenomenological analysis of more than 100 interviews with psychologists and entrepreneurs to identify what exactly it is that makes a founder emotionally fit. After analyzing the interviews and coding them by theme, she distilled her findings into seven traits: ==self-awareness, empathy, willingness to play, curiousity, mindfulness, resilience, effective communication==

#### Traits
##### Self-Awareness
> _Dr. Anhalt’s definition: Emotionally fit leaders are self-reflective. They understand their triggers and biases and continuously check in with themselves. They are patient, resilient and willing to be vulnerable with others. They can tolerate frustration and manage their emotions. They understand that the feelings they have about others have a lot to do with their own selves._

How to work on this trait:
- Start with yourself and see what you’re transferring.
> “There’s an interesting psychological phenomenon that I’m seeing a lot of right now called institutional transference,” says Anhalt. “[[Institutional transference]] happens ==when we put feelings about something other than work onto our place of work, or vice versa.‬== And it’s especially intense right now. We have a lot of feelings — and not a lot of control. We also feel guilt for complaining when others have it worse, so our emotions have nowhere to go. They get disguised as other, more acceptable issues. Fears about the future morph into concerns your team isn’t pushing hard enough. Your fights with your co-founder might be coming from something you have going on at home. And we have no idea that some of these feelings might be about something else entirely.”
- Get to therapy, if you can — especially if “nothing’s wrong.”

##### Empathy
> Dr. Anhalt’s definition: Emotionally fit leaders can (and do) put themselves in others’ shoes on a regular basis. They recognize that what they feel about things might not necessarily be what others feel, and they strive for empathy even when it is difficult. Although they must sometimes make unilateral decisions, they consider how those decisions will affect others.

- Tap into how your team is feeling
- Remember to fill your reserves

##### Willingness to play
> Dr. Anhalt’s definition: Emotionally fit leaders understand and encourage the importance of play. Play sparks spontaneity and creativity, and is a crucial part of emotional health and interpersonal cohesiveness. Playing means trying on thoughts or concepts to see how they feel. It means having a free exchange of ideas and meeting of the minds.


##### Curiousity
> Dr. Anhalt’s definition: Emotionally fit leaders understand and tolerate the difference between what they want to be true and what is true, and they make it a habit to ask questions and be curious, even when the answers to those questions are uncomfortable.

> “This might be unexpected, but I always tie this trait back to feedback,” says Anhalt. “Curiosity is often framed as this kind of solo quest. ‘I’m curious about this, so I'm going to research this and read that,’ and so on. But I also think [[Curiosity is the best skill to counteract defensiveness]]. When someone comes to us with constructive feedback, often our first instinct is to defend ourselves or explain why they got it wrong. If instead we get curious and ask questions like, ‘Tell me more about that?’ or ‘What could I do differently next time?’ ==we avoid this defensive reflex and open ourselves up to growth==.”

To solicit ongoing feedback and get a more thorough picture of what those around you are seeing, she suggests cultivating your ==listening skills.== Here are some tips that Anhalt has developed in her years working with clients as a therapist:
- Remember that you don’t have to always use words to show you’re listening — nods and facial expressions are often just as powerful.
- Instead of focusing on what you’re going to say next, stay present in the conversation.
- Allow for pauses and silence so the speaker can reflect on what they’re saying and expand upon it. The first thing a person says is often not what they really want you to know.
- Don’t feel compelled to fix things or give advice right away. When in doubt, ask what the speaker needs — whether it’s comfort, solutions or they’re just looking to vent.

##### Mindfulness
> Dr. Anhalt’s definition: Emotionally fit leaders can sit with and process through discomfort. They are able to have tough conversations, be transparent about uncomfortable information, share complicated feedback and sit with a problem until it has been fully thought through.

> Anhalt likens strengthening mindfulness to how the practice of yoga involves holding your body and settling into poses that might feel uncomfortable in the moment. “If you’re making a decision or taking an action purely to move away from discomfort, take a moment to reflect on whether the discomfort is really so intolerable. Sit with it for a while, take a deep breath and prove to yourself that you can handle it. You do not need to break every silence, fix every issue immediately or avoid difficult conversations,” she says.

Self-care is one of the first things to go when times get tough, but if you want to lead and help others through times of struggle, you need to put on your own oxygen mask first. Here are four specific tactics Anhalt recommends:
- Reflect on one thing you’re too hard on yourself about. Forgive yourself.
- Think of one small thing people could do to support you this week. Ask for it.
- Write down what you appreciate about three people you love. Send it to them.
- Schedule a “worry hour.” Block off a slot on your calendar where you get to be as worried as you want for that amount of time.

##### Resilience
> Dr. Anhalt’s definition: Emotionally fit leaders know that more is to be learned from failure than success, and can bounce back during trying times and can take in difficult feedback. Their desire to grow is genuinely greater than their desire to avoid criticism or failure. They are flexible and can adapt quickly.


##### Effective Communication
> Dr. Anhalt’s definition: Emotionally fit leaders are able to put words to their needs and expectations. They are able to talk through issues in a proactive, ongoing way. They can balance flexibility with maintaining their authority and appropriate boundaries.
