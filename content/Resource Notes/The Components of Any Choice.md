## Notes
Your **second required reading** will introduce you to the basics of discernment and the tools you will need to carry it out.

In this reading taken from his book _Discernment: The Art of Choosing Well_, Wolff introduces us to the tools we need to discern properly and he explains the place of God in the act of discernment.

### Reflection Questions
-   What are the tools for discernment that Wolff presents?
	- The framework: time
		- "The more important the problem, the more time we ask of ourselves or others for decision making."
	- The tools: head and heart
		- Head: reflecting on the situation, looking for information, weighing pros and cons, foreseeing the consequences
		- Heart: verifies whetehr or not the possible solution appeals to us
		- "We screen with our heart what we discover with our head in order to make a decision that is *ours* and one we can confirm subjectively"
	- The cornerstone: values
-   Why is discernment considered to be a "method"?
-   What does faith in God have to do with the act of discernment?
