## Why you need to understand your market
- New founders often start out thinking, “Our market is huge! Everyone will buy our product!” The reality: there’s a specific market for every product. And selling to them—versus everyone in general—is a key distinction. 
- Before we dive in, here’s how we’ll be using the terms “market” and “customer” throughout this chapter:
	- **Market:** the broad group of people interested in a product, including both buyers (customers) and sellers (your brand and competitors)
	- **Customer:** the people most likely to buy your product, which make up a smaller, more segmented part of your total market
- Next, every company needs to do market and customer research:
	- **Pre-launch:** Research validates market demand for a potential product. It also uncovers new problems that need solving.
	- **Post-launch:** Research guides companies toward improving their existing product, getting more customers, and retaining current ones.
- Note that research is _especially_ important for early-stage companies facing “**market risk**”—that is, ==when you’re not sure if anyone wants your product enough to pay for it. ==
- Here’s a quick framework to find out if you should be focusing more on market and customer research:
	- Do most customers know your product’s main value props?
	- Do people group your product accurately with the right competitors?
	- Are people who rejected similar products willing to try yours?
	- Do customers recommend your product to others?
	- Would customers be upset if your product suddenly disappeared?
- If you’ve answered more than one question with a no, there’s probably some disconnect between your brand and your target customers—and you need to do more market and customer research to align them together. 
- Your brand is ultimately ==a reflection of how the market views it==, not how you view it.
