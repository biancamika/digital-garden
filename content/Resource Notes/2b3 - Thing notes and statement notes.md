title: "2b3 - Thing notes and statement notes"
---
When it comes to notes about ideas, there are two types:
1. **Thing notes** are concepts and any other noun-like "thing".
2. **Statement notes** are opinions and observations.

- You can make both of these types of notes into living, evergreen notes.  
- Many evergreen notes should be statements with a strong opinion. That’s because it forces you to really think about what you’re trying to say.  
- However, these **_statements_** need **_things_** to talk about!   What are these things?

## Thing notes
> Thing notes are concepts and any other noun-like "thing".

All of the following are examples of thing notes:
- **Concepts**: A concept is a pattern, truth, or mechanism recognized and given a name.
    - This can also include definitions, terms, and topics (even people, if we want to conceptualize someone).
- **Nouns**: People, places, or generally any other nouns.
- **Knowns**: The Magna Carta was signed in 1215 (which we can gently call "facts").
- **Standards**: Manuals, best practices, and other things that follow a process.
    - Examples include anything from mathematical formulas, to the basics of language, to the process of putting a bike together.

## Statement notes
> Statement notes are opinions and observations.

Statement notes force you to sharpen and evolve your thinking in rapid succession. ==If you want to generate more value, try sharpening your statement notes.  ==
  
Here are some random statement notes:
- Note-making is about the pursuit of truth
- The LATCH model doesn't leave out "relevance"
- Nothing tastes as good as a sharp mind feels

- How do thing notes and statement notes interact?
- As you make thing notes, you will naturally spin out ideas of your own.
- Convert some of your written ideas into new statement notes (preferably with strong opinions). For example:
	- Evergreen notes »»» Linking your thinking encourages leaps of insights
	- Positive Feedback Loop »»» Habits carry a ton of hidden inertia
- In this way, thing notes are sturdy dots—they are ==cognitive scaffolding==—that we build to support the leaps of insights that come from crafting statement notes.  
- It can also go in the other direction too. While watching something on Rodin's _"The Thinker"_, I had a personal insight and made the statement note:  
	- Great works are flavored by early works »»» Rodin and Beethoven
- Sometimes _things_ generate _statements_.  Other times _statements_ generate _things_. This is the LYT way: sensemaking through note-making!
