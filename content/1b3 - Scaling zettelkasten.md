[[LYT 10 MOC]]

While the Zettelkasten Method has given us the power to make **_fast_**, **_atomic_**, and **_linked_** notes, ==it doesn't naturally give us enough structure.== It only links directly from note to note. It doesn't provide a way to view our notes from a higher level.   
  
That's a problem that ==higher-order notes== elegantly solve. And the side-effects of using higher-order notes are actually even more exciting and powerful!   
  
> **_Higher-order notes not only allow you to structure your notes, they force you to develop them!_**

Please repeat that.  
  
Once we realize that there are basic notes, and then there are higher-order notes, we can begin to discover underlying patterns inherent in our link-based notes. If we understand this, we can masterfully manage and grow our link-based knowledge.
