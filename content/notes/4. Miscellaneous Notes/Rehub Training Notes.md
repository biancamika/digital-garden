**Plies**
+ STEP into first position, don't force the rotation
+ Don't be completely vertical when doing plies, be slightly forward
+ Lower back arch so that your hips have more space for turnout
+ When you straighten your legs think about ZIPPING UP
+ Arch lower back when doing forward bend until 90 degrees
+ After 90 degrees, round back, put both arms in fifth (don't leave hand on barre because uneven stretch)
+ During backbend, make sure you engage your stomach, ELONGATE! Before going back
+ And when you bend back, aim for LONG, not DEEP, so that you don't compress your lower back

**Tendus, Jetes**
+ Turning in and out to the side? Use your hips
+ To the back: make sure your weight is fully on the supporting foot.
+ When doing piques to the front, use your lower abs. Trying breathing it out so that your body can remember
