### Chapter 2: A Theology of Marriage
#### Prolegomenon
- Theological and historical context
- Eph 5: Paul gives additional context to marriage; it is not only a natural reality but also a =="mystery"==, an image of and a window to God's relationship with his people
- **Historical Introduction**
	- Coontz: Marriage is lived and understood by various cultures throug history
		- Not primarily about individual needs and desires; it had as much to do w/ ==acquiring good in-laws and increasing one's family labor== force as it did with finding a lifetime companion and raising children
		- Also organized the division of labor and power by gender and age
	- Marriage was not fundamentally about love; it was too vital an ==economic and political institution== to be left to two individuals
		- hence the involvement of matchmakers, government, and religion
		- love as the basis for marriage = serious threat to social order and stability
		- Derived from objective conditions and structures outside of marriage itself
	- Schil traces the root cause of these changes (marriage becoming more personal) to ==industrialization==
		- brought about greater mobility of populations and breakdown of extended family
		- Many functions of extended family have been taken over by state machinery 
			- E.G. health insurance, retirement homes, social security, education, daycare
		- The result...
			- It became more important that the choice of spouse be personal rather than imposed from the outside
			- The extended family's influence over personal decisions weakened

#### Marriage as a Human Reality
- **The Human and the Sacramental**
	- the sacraments are based on human realities and are ==religious/faith "interpretations" of these human realities==
	- the sacraments build on the human realities in order to make clearer and more concrete the religious and the divine realities
	- Human reality is =="chronologically prior"==; the religious interpretation does not modify/intrude/reshape the inner structure of the human reality
	- The relationship between the human reality and the divine truth is ==one of sign and meaning==
		- sign should not contradict the meaning
		- human reality as sign should be revelatory of the divine truth...proportinate and adequate to it
- **The human reality that is adopted as a "symbol" of the divine truth and which is given a religious interpretation is ==a good and a value in itself==, even apart from the religious meaning**
	- These human realities were chosen precisely because of their ==intrinsic goodness/value== already even as human realities
	- These values are realized in a special way in marriage
		- Procreative Potential
			- not only the bringing forth, formation, and education of new life
			- but also the spouses "recreating" themselves, becoming better versions
		- Community and Friendship
			- Establish a committed, loving, responsible, exclusive relation — different from any other relationship/friendship
		- Fidelity and Commitment
			- On commitment and freedom
				- freedom from and freedom for
				- freedom is not the ultimate value
				- freedom is only an instrumental value/potential; man is only in the state of "potency" (e.g. musician, athlete, etc.) this potential is realized as a person excercises freedom
				- unless this freedom is excercised, one is even likely to lose these potentials
				- ==commitment is freedom excercised==
			- Why should marriage be a committed relationship?
				- a better way towards maturity than other commited relationships is yet to be found...
				- unless the relationship is committed and this commitment is supported by the community via its values and enforced by its laws, a person could forever be skimming the surface of relations (pleasure-driven)
				- unless committed, a person could go through life in his self-centered ways, no responsibilities, just doing what pleases him, no "spiritual growth"
					- Scott Peck: effort and will norms
			- Any reason to withdraw from a committed relationship?
				- Fidelity and commitment: values related to the ultimate value that is the human person
				- Fidelity and commitment are not the ultimate value...conceivable that observance of fidelity could result in the ultimate value that is the human person
					- Self-sacrifice? Sacrificing something less (yourself) for something greater
				- CAVEAT: the claim that a relationship violates the human person is made more often than warranted
- **This is the human reality that "becomes" a sacrament by virtue of the baptism of the parties**
	- Questions:
		- What does baptism "do" to effect this "ontological" change?
		- How does baptism do this?
	- Answers:
		- Baptism puts the life of the person on a ==different plane of meaning==
		- Through baptism, a person takes on the ==new responsibility of participating in the prophetic mission of Christ and of the church==
		- The marriage of baptized persons has a special meaning
			- See *Infra*

#### The Sacramentality of Marriage
- **Marriage in general (as a human and natural reality) in SS**
	- According to Genesis...
		- Man and woman are different ways of reflecting God's image
		- Their union in marriage is part of God's plan and is thus good
	- According to Hosea...
		- Marriage is seen as an apt symbol of the covenant between Yahweh (ever faithful one) and Israel
		- Prophet Hosea was held as a "model" because of his fidelity to his wife Gomer
		- When a person is baptized, he also assumes a prophetic function in the manner of Hosea, ==to witness to and remind the world of God's fidelity to his covenant==
		- What does the Hosea-Gomer event say about marriage in general?
			- Capacity of marriage to be an ==adequate and appropriate language to be a symbol of God's fidelity==
			- Spouses like Hosea have to be faithful....otherwise Yahweh could not speak through them and their marriage
			- Emphasizes necessity of human responsibility and cooperation with Yahweh
			- Hosea and Gomer: predecessor of Christian spouses
	- According to Mark...
		- context of conversation: divorce in the Old Testament (DIY divorce)
		- Jesus says no to this DIY divorce
			- Moses only allowed this because of the hardness of your heart...but this was not so from the beginning
		- Jesus: Marriage should be stable, not easily breakable, certainly not easily as the DIY divorce
	- Summary and Conclusion
		- Being male and female and their union in marriage is part of ==God's plan==
		- Marriage has the capacity to be a ==language==
			- Has the depth and richness to carry a meaning beyond the natural reality
			- Yahweh used the Hosea-Gomer marriage to reassure Israel of his unconditional fidelity
		- Quality of marriage affirmed by Jesus in Mark is its ==stability==
			- This makes marriage a maturing context even as a natural reality
			- This same quality makes marriage an appropriate symbol and witness to God's fidelity to its people
- **Marriage as a Christian Sacrament (according to Ephesians)**
	- Overview
		- Paul reflects on the richness and depth of the reality of marriage, and attributes it to a special meaning
		- He interprets the "human reality" of marriage and sees God's presence and work in the loving, committed and responsible relationship between man and woman
	- Quotes
		- Genesis 2, 24:
			- Nobility of marriage — one leaves his family of origin to start his/her own family
			- Equality of man and woman — both man and woman shall leave their respective families, and now cling to each other
		- Mark 10: Jesus derived the conjclusion that ==what God has joined together, man must not separate== — the stability/indissoulubility of marriage
		- Paul's take on this text: marriage is a great mystery which refers to ==Christ and the Church==
	- Mystery in Paul summary
		- Eph 5, 32: the word is used to refer to the comparison of marriage to the union of Christ and the Church
		- There is a great hidden truth being revealed in the committed one-flesh relationship between man and wife, and this truth refers to the ==relationship between Christ and the Church==
		- The relationship between H-W should reveal this truth about Christ and the Church
		- H-W, like the apostles, and Hosea and Gomer, ==participate in this prophetic mission to reveal God's fidelity to his people==
	- Theological Reflection
		- Introductory Comments
			- General
				- The structure of the sacrament: like fully human acts, there is a ==material form (sensate)== and a ==meaning (supra sensate)==
					- E.G. bread and wine -> spiritual noruishment
				- There is a proportion of meaning and resonance between the symbol and the meaning
				- "Symbol" is not merely an external reality that stands in the place of its meaning as a substitute reality
					- E.G. blue eage on the facade of the gym, St. Ignatius Loyola kneeling down to offer his sword
				- The symbol has an ==intrinsic connection== with its meaning
					- E.G. flowers and gifts are symbols of your love
					- They are not mere external signs or labels of your love; they also make your love more real + deeper
					- "Efficient" signs that cause something in the relationship
				- The "symbols" in the sacraments were not Catholic inventions; they were taken over and transformed
					- E.G. Water and washing are human realities that lead themselves to symbolic interpretation
					- Old Testament: oil was used to anoint kings due to its preservative qualities
					- Chrisitanity took over these symbols and gave them new meaning
			- When we affirm that baptism, confirmation, Eucharist, marriage etc. are sacraments, we are affirming the ff. of them:
				- They are ==official acts of the Church==
				- They are a means to ==accomplish the mission of Christ== (salvific/redemptive)
				- They are a ==language== through which God speaks to us that we may know him better, a deeper heart-knowledge of God (revelatory)
			- Marriage was the last sacrament to be recognized as an official act of the Church due to some theological difficulties (not yet fully resolved)
				- What is the human reality that becomes a sacrament? Theological consenseus: ==the entire life of the spouses becomes the sacrament, not just the ceremony in the Church==
					- In the beginning, there was no (Catholic) ritual for marraige. The husband and wife just moved in togetehr and they were accepted as married by the community
				- Objection: Marriage includes sexual relations and sex can only be justified when done for procreation; but sex in marriage is not only for procreation so it is actually an opportunity for sin
			- a
		- Marriage as a Sacrament
			- Marriage is an ACT of the CHURCH
				- Marriage is a human reality that many people engage in and live, not just Christians
					- Love each other, raise their kids, fulfill their responsibiltiies, mature and become better persons...
				- When a person is baptized, he is incorporated into the community of the Chruch...==his entire life — actions, loving, being, growing — is collocated on a different plane==
					- E.G. identifying as Atenean, or joining the Glee Club
				- A baptized person assumes his repsonsibilities as a member of the Church...marriage specifices the general responsibility assumed in baptism
				- Christ speaks through the community of the Church to the world
					- He shows his fidelity to his people, his desire to save and to draw us to the fullness that he offers
				- By baptism, the baptized's married life becomes a language of Christ and the Church
					- It is not just their own life, but also of the Church to which they belong
						- E.G. being a Glee Club singer
			- Marriage is SALVIFIC
				- The historical development of the question
					- Augustine/1
						- Literal truth of Genesis 3: there were no uncontrolable passions because everything was according to reason/will of God; sex was only for procreation
						- The first sin created a rupture between man and God, between man and his better self
						- Breakdown in man's wholeness -> man finds himself drawn to different directions
							- Paul: I do what I do not want to do and don't do what I really want to do
						- The disruption of the relation between God and man also happened internally to man
						- Concupscience (state of rebellion of man against God) took this form: the sex act was now governed by pleasure rather than the desire to cooperate with God's will
						- Sex in marriage is not always for procreation...sex is inevitable in marriage, thus sin is inevitable in marriage
						- Marriage is the default vocation of the weak
					- Augustine/2
						- Over time, his theology softened
						- Marriage could be salvific in a negative sense
							- Each man should have his own wife...do not deprive one another so that Satan may not tempt you
							- Sex is limited to one's partner, making it less frequent
						- Marriage is redemptive in a negative sense
							- it limits sinfulness
							- it is a damage control measure
					- Gaudium et spes
						- The intimate partnership of life and love is rooted in the ==contract of the partners==, in their ==irrevocable consent==
						- Married love is uniquely expressed and perfected in the marraige act
							- noble and honorable
							- the truly human performance of these acts fosters the self-giving they signify and enriches the spouses in joy and gratitude
						- These paradigm-changing insights concern:
							- the understanding of marriage from *contract* (exchange of rights) to consortium totius vitae
							- breaks new ground in understanding the meaning of the sexual act
								- Augustine: 
									- original justice: procreation was faithful to God's intention
									- original sin: pleasure is sinful
								- GS: the marital act ==expresses conjugal love and perfects the love== between husband and wife
						- Comments about GS:
							- enlarged the understanding of marriage ==from mere contract to a life-partnership==
								- contract: rights, sexual rights
								- marriage: unrecognizable as a relationship between friends
							- Contract model saw sexual act as a right (biological POV). Considered moral when intended for procreation. Sexual act was sole ingredient of marriage, unrelated to other realities (e.g. care, understanding, responsibility, friendship)
							- Contract model is reflected in discipline of Catholic Church
								- E.G. minimum age for marriage (14 for girls and 16 for boys)
								- marriage is dissolved if not consummated
								- physical impotence is an impediment to marriage
							- Offers a broader and more human understanding as an intimate life-partnership
								- composed of many ingredientts like communication, trust, etc
								- not monolithic, but multifaceted
								- In this context, the sexual act ==can attain and be understood in all its depth and richness==
							- The marital act expresses and perfects the love of the spouses. It's not an isolated reality; ==its meaning is rooted in and arises from the life/love of the spouses==
								- sacramental structure: if the love is real, it must be expressed in an external way. at the same time, the external expression (as a sign) is set apart by the meaning it bears
								- Remember FC: a person is a body informed by an immortal spirit, and a spirit that expresses itself in a body
									- Sexual acts are fully human only if they are part of the love by which man and woman commit themselves to each other
								- The meaning of the act is not only in the act but in the life they live. 
									- Not merely a passing, momentary pleasure
							- 3rd possible meaning for the sexual act: expression and perfection of love.
								- The effect and cause of deeper love
				- In what way is marriage said to be salvific/redemptive?
					- Thesis:
						- There's a proportion and similarity in meaning between the ==natural reality (symbol) and the sacred (revealed)==
							- E.G. preservative quality of oil -> preservation of new life; bread and wine -> spiritual nourishment
						- Spouses can become better persons — ==marriage is a context in which spouses mature and grow==; they can learn to love and sacrifice
						- "Becoming better persons": good human quality to symbolize and make concrete "salvation" understood as fuller life with God
					- More positive interpretation of marriage is in response to what Waite and Gallagher call =="Myths of post-marriage culture"==
						- Divorce is usually the best answer for kids when the marriage becomes unhappy. *But is divorce always the best answer?*
						- Marriage is all about children; if there's none, spouses may as well break up. But marriage is not all about children; *getting and staying married has a powerful effect on the well-being of adults*
						- Rebutting the claim that marriage may be good for men but bad for women
						- Promoting marriage and marital obligation puts women at risk for domestic violence, and divorce can help women escape this; W and G cite a lot of studies that counter this
						- Marriage is a private matter, and no outsider should be allowed to interfere...
					- Practical consequences of this deconstruction:
						- As marriage ceases to be vital to children, single motherhood is elevated in status. It's no longer just a family tragedy; it's just another personal option in a freedom loving world
						- Higher expectations of marriage
							- Marriage becomes just one of the equally valid lifestyles
							- Marriage is demoted from uniquely honored relationship -> one of the possibile relationships (and no one should interfere)
						- For law practitioners: marriage is a part of continuum of commitment ratehr than a distinctive and distinct relationship
						- At the heart of this deconstruction: ==the attempt to demote marriage from a unique public commitment (supported by law, custom, society, religion) to a private relationship terminable at will==
						- This demotion is done in the name of choice and freedom, but ==reimagining marriage as a purely private relation does not expand anyone's choices==
						- Instead, it takes away from the individual marriage itself: the choice to enter a uniquely powerful and life-enhancing bond
							- way more durable than the immediate shifting feelings of two persons
					- The Marriage Bargain: Is marriage a public institution governed by laws and supported by society? Or is it merely a private emotional relationship built by two people for their personal/individual happiness?
						- If marriage is purely private: the government (or any external body) should not "privilege" marriage
							- You should be treated in the same way by others (whether married or cohabitating)
							- When dissatisfied, you should be able to walk away and find your happiness elsewhere
						- If marriage is a public instution: this changes the social world. 
							- creates obligations between partners, between them and others
							- makes it wrong to have an affair, beause it is wrong to break a vow
						- When married couples are treated differently, it's not discrimination but common sense
							- Married couples should be treated differently because ==marriage makes a difference==...it changes people's golas and behaviors in ways that are life-enhancing
							- It produces good thigns for spouses, children, and society
							- Even if not everyone lives up to their vows, ==the public promise of forever makes a big difference in the way people feel and behave==; it encourages actors to play their roles as responsible husbands and wives
						- This makes the vow liberating: the security of the contract frees individuals to make long term exchanges that leave each other better off
						- Like a contract, it has obligations
							- less freedom to act unilaterally v.s. unmarried persons (e.g. spending money, staying out late)
							- but in exchange, this makes each person more confident in the fidelity of the other
							- ^ less anxiety about sexual performance, less fears about sexual abandonment, less cause for jealousy
						- But it makes people better off because it constrains them from certain behaviors...these are attractive in the short-term, but don't pay off in the long run
					- ==PERMANENCE is key to marriage's transformative power==
							- People in permanent relationships organize their lives differently v.s. people who are less certain
							- This expectation leads to what economists call *specialization*
								- Spouses can develop some skills and neglect others because they can count on their partner (e.g. dividing chores)
								- partnerships increase the pool talent
									- each partner chooses what needs to be done based on their proficiency
									- the couple works like a team
								- Not gender roles...this overly rigid thinking can interfere with specialization
					- Primacy and exclusivity: marriage makes you better off because you become important to someone...someone who loves you and depends on you
							- This knowledge makes marriage the ultimate contract
							- We may have many emotionally fulfilling relationships...but the emotional relationship underlying marriage is fundamentally different from all of these because of the primacy and exclusivity
							- ^ this is expressed and enriched by the sexual act
						- Marriage is fueled by a magic ingredient: ==TRUST==
							- it reduces the need to monitor compliance
							- The public vow, enforced by love, law, custom, and religion is the driving force behind the bond that creates these life-enhancing changes
						- The COHABITATION DEAL
							- The prime difference: time horizons and commitment
								- Cohabilitation: temporary arrangement (2 years)
							- Cohabiting partner is in an awkward position (not children's father/stepfather, have no legal authority/reponsibility)
							- Risks becoming emotionally attached to kids
							- Children living with cohabiting couples show poorer emotional development
							- Cohabitation's biggest attraction: relatively easy exit, no well-defined responsibilities
							- Weaker commitment extends to other aspects of life, like sexual fidelity
							- Themes: Marriage -> Union v.s. Cohab -> Individualism
							- The cost of "freedom" is high
								- cohabitors don't get to enjoy the advantages of a deeper partnership
								- they don't regulate each other's behavior
								- forgo benefits of specialization
								- cannot plan together long-term because they are uncertain about the future
						- Monogamy makes sex better, physically and emotionally
							- Practice makes perfect: Partenrs increased their energy and attention that each devotes to the partner, developing "partner-specific" skills
							- Benefits
								- Proximity and convenience
								- Long-term contract
								- Exclusivity
								- Emotional bonding
					- So how is marriage again said to be *salvific*?
						- ==It is a context in which persons mature;== they learn to be responsible and to forgive, to grow, to become better persons
						- It is a ==human reality== in which believers ==see and recognize that God is present== and is ==working== in a very special and palpable way
			- Marriage as REVELATORY
				- SS: Marraige is used as an ==image of fidelity of God to his people==
				- Paul: the fidelity of God is witnessed and made more real in the world through the fidelity of the spouses to each other
				- Today, it's difficult to imagine God's fidelity to us because fidelity is such a rare commodity in the world (i.e. break-ups, betrayals, abandonments)
				- Mission of Christians: share the mission of Christ and of the Church to witness God's fidelity, that God does not abandon us, despite evil and suffering around us
				- Hosea: marriage is not automatically a symbol of God's fidelity
				- Rather, ==it is a reality that must be "erected from below"==, a work in progress that both partners must work at. This is responsibility assumed
				- Baptism: all Christians take on the responsibility to ==share the prophetic mission of Christ== as a member of the Christian community
				- This general responsibility is specified by the vocation, way of life we choose — married couples, single, religious, priests
- **The Role of Faith**
	- The difficulty raised by Mackin: ==the sacramentality of marraige seems "automatic", almost "magical"==
		- as if all one needs to do is to be baptized (C. 1055. 2)
	- The popular belief: our marriage is unhappy because we have not received God's blessing
	- Faith
		- Man's COMPREHENSIVE "yes" to God's revelation of himself and of his saving plan for us
		- Includes many elements, engages all the human faculties
	- Faith and the Sacrament
		- The sacrament is primarily the =="act of God"== (according to the DSD no. 46)
			- It is God's action in the ritual, God animates the fusion (of the human act and the cultural symbol) with his intention and meaning
			- He uses this fusion to do good things in the participants, acting in their whole persons in an effort to draw them to Himself
		- As an act of God, the sacrament therefore implies certanity, regarding which, the following must be said:
			- The CERTANITY PRINCIPLE ("opus operatum" or "ex opere operato")
				- It is God himself who works in the human reality
				- Not the priest who merely acts as an agent/intermediary
				- Not the ritual or the symbolic act
			- But emphasis on the certanity principle (that it is God himself who works in the sacraments) led to certain exaggerations that ignored the human responsibility and cooperation dimension
				- E.G. master of ceremonies turned missal to wrong page
				- This led to Mackin's criticism
			- Augustine and Pelagius' clarification: men are graced not against their will but according ot their cooperation
				- The water tank image?
				- Self-righteousness: the sin against the Holy Spirit (see Matthew 12, 32)
				- Jesus at the door (Rev 3, 20)
	- Faith and the Sacrament of Marriage
		- the intention to participate in any sacrament -> the intention to participate in a =="human ritual/reality"== in which we believe ==Christ is present and working==
			- Christian marriage: the intention to participate in the human reality of marriage acknowledged explicitly as a XT event (i..e. in which Christ works and is present to reveal and to save)
		- This intention is directed by a ==FAITH that BELIEVES in God who reveals himself in Jesus Christ==, who lives and works in the Church, a Church which continues his presence and work in the world precisely through human realities
		- Thus, the necessity of baptism — not merely in the fact of baptism, but baptism that is ==lived in our daily life==
		- Thus, not AUTOMATIC
			- it is a ==human endeavor to cooperate==
			- and so, ==human responsibility==
			- "Man is graced not against his will but according to his cooperation"
- **Summary and Conclusion**: Difference between sacramental and non-sacramental marraige
	- The difference is on the ==level of meaning== , not on the level of empirical reality. 
		- The marraige between the baptized is not necessarily better, or that between non-baptized necessarily worse, or little chance of success
	- On the level of meaning: the baptized spouses are aware of ==another level of meaning, of an added responsibility==
	- The witness of Christian spouses is clearer in this sense: ==it is not an individual/isolated "statement" but a witness of communities==...
		- ...all over the world and over time, of many people striving to remain faithful to each other, struggling to be good parents, striving to form their children in the values of Christ
		- We see couples encouraging and helping each other fulfill their responsibilties (e.g. Marriage encounter)
	- Because there is an added meaning, there is another level of responsibility incumbent upon the Christian spouses. Their married life is not just a natural reality but also a ==ministry, a participation in the salvific mission of Christ==
		- There is an awareness of the need to ==open== their hearts and minds, their dispositions, their marriage — their entire being and relationship — ==to God's grace and transforming action==
		- E.G. We study harder for a final exam because it has heavier weight; the Blue Eagles practice more seriously and play with greater effort and hassle in the finals than in elimniations. This is because of the ADDED meaning
		- The certainity principle means that ==God's presence and grace is most certainly present== in the "pipelines", and our stance is that of ==openness to God's action, our responsibility is that we desire that He act in our hearts and in our lives.== But God does not bulldoze his way into our hearts and sanctify and save us whether we like it or not. Thus, ==we are graced not against our will but according to our cooperation.==

#### Orals
**Guidelines:**
- 10 MINUTES MAX
- Introduce your thesis by talking about its location/context in the chapter (what went before, what follows)

**Thesis:**
Marriage is a Christian sacrament—an official act of  the Church; it is revelatory; it is redemptive/salvific. The redemptive capacity of marriage underwent a development, from  Augustine/1, Augustine/2, and finally to the game changing   insights of Gaudium et Spes 48-49.


**Outline:**
1. Provide thesis and its context
	1. General topic: the sacramentality of marriage
	2. What went before: Marriage in general in SS (old testament stories)?
	3. What went after: Waite and Gallagher on myths of post marriage culture (practical application)
2. Expound on redemptive capacity of marriage
	1. It helps spouses become better persons by providing them a context in which spouses mature and grow, by learning to love and to sacrifice
	2. It is a human reality in which believers see and recognize that God is present, and is working in a very special and palpable way
	3. The symbolization makes our  "salvation" with God more concrete -> with God, we have fuller lives
3. How did the redemptive capacity of marriage develop? (main)
	1. Augustine/1: Marriage is seen as the default vocation of the weak
		1. Genesis 3: there were no uncontrollable passions because everything was according to the reason/will of God
			1. sex was only for procreation; this is faithful to God's intention
		2. After the occurence of the first sin, which created a rupture between man and God, sex became an act governed by pleasure, instead of the desire to cooperate with God's will
			1. Manifestation of concupscience (tendency of man to sin; state of rebellion of man against God)
			2. Pleasure is sinful
		3. Sex in marriage isn't always for procreation -> sex is inevitable in marriage -> sin is inevitable in marriage
	2. Softened in Augustine/2: Marriage could be salvific/redemptive in a negative sense. How?
		1. Each man should have his own wife...do not deprive one another so that Satan may not tempt you
		2. Sex is limited to your exclusive partner, making it less frequent
		3. Limits sinfulness
		4. Damage control measure
		5. This can be seen in historical context: marriage was seen as a contract model
			1. Utilitarian + objective; collective needs > individual needs
				1. E.G. acquring good in-laws, increasing family labot
			2. Sexual act was seen as a right (biological POV)
			3. Sexual act was sole ingredient of marriage, unrelated to other realities (e.g. care, understanding, responsibility, friendship)
	3. Gaudium et Spes 48-49: 
		1. Overview:
			1. Marriage is expanded from mere contract model to life partnership. A broader and more human understanding
			2. Foundation of relationship is still the partners' contract, their irrevocable consent
			3. Expansion: The marital act expresses and perfects the love of the spouses. 
				1. How? the truly human performance of the act fosters the self-giving they signify and enriches the spouses in joy and gratitude
					1. Consortium totius vitae: reciprocal self-giving of the spouses
				2. It is no longer an isolated reality; its meaning is rooted in and arises from the life/love of the spouse
					1. Remember: marriage is a sacrament. 
						1. If the love is real, it must be expressed in an external way.
						2. At the same time, the external expression (as a sign) is set apart by the meaning it bears
					2. Sexual acts are fully human only if they are a part of the love where man and woman commit themselves to each other
					3. The meaning of the act is not only in the act but in the life they live. 
						1. not just passing pleasure
4. Summary and Conclusion
	1. As a Christian sacrament, marriage has the capacity to redeem us from not just sin, but from a reality where we're disconnected w/ God
	2. However, it wasn't always seen this way; exemplified by Augustine's writings, marriage was seen as an environment that encouraged sin because it enabled sexual acts -> individualistic pleasure
	3. Thanks to Gaudium et Spes, we understand marriage as a partnership, one of reciprocal self-giving. Now, these marital acts are seen as expressions + perfections of the spouses' love because they foster this self-giving. Not just limited to the act; their lives are also enriched with joy and gratitude. Hence its redemptive capacity.
