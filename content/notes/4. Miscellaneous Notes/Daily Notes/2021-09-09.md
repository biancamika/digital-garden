*What does it mean to be intense? How does our essence, tools, and longevity shape it?*

#personaldevelopment #life 

+ On intense people: how they think, act, carry themselves is something that's very them. In short, someone is intense because **they are in touch with their ==essence.==**
+ The problem is **most of life beats our intensity out of us.**

> Like physics, **civilization accumulates more tools as it progresses.** We don’t teach children the spirit of how to go about living life, but instead make them go through lengthy education (Not everyone needs college, but we all need better K-12). ==**We are pushed into shaping our lives with so many tools, without knowing that we can make our own tools or not use them at all.**== That’s how our intensity is diluted.

> Furthermore, when everything is at the click of a button, **we stop exercising our judgement and opt for the most convenient.** Instead of downloading MP3s and picking the best songs for our limited storage, we just let random Spotify playlists run through our minds. Instead of stumbling upon hidden gems we never knew we wanted in bookstores, we just rely on algorithms to find the bestsellers. “We shape our tools, and thereafter our tools shape us.” ==**When we fail to exercise our judgement in choosing our tools, what does that say about the person we become?**==

> It’s why working on longevity is important. **If we know life lasts for hundreds of years, wouldn’t we nurture our essence more and refuse to let the world lessen our intensity?** We would take time to curate and build tools fit for us, time to truly define our ambitions, time to shape the beautiful buildings that we want to create in this world.

+ Beautiful buildings are inefficient in the short term, but efficient in the long term
	+ Things built for the short temr will simply be torn down, and descend into cultural malaise
+ Related: Longtermism from EA
+ it's essential to invest time into making your inputs and environment reflect your essence, even if it seems unproductive on the surface. 
	+ spruce up your workspace
	+ seek new books
+ Breaking down how:
	+ Start with mindset: *"You have a hundred years left to live ahead of you"*
	+ sort through the inputs you receive from the world and make sure they are as unadulterated as possible.
		+ in a world of algorithmic dominance, choose small acts of rebellion
			+ timeline -> lists
			+ restaurant discovery without Yelp
			+ listen to only downloaded music
			+ pick up books you've never heard of
	+ Above all, **create.**

> Above all, create. Write, research, code — it's only through creating that you can extract your essence and manifest it into the world. **==Creating is ultimately an act of longevity.==** Your creations reflect who you are and you yourself become your creations. As you revise them through the feedback loops of the world, you refine your essence as well, waking up one day amazed at your transformation. That’s how you become more intense, more you. When you seek intensity, you might surprise yourself with versions of yourself you never imagined existed.

+ E.G. FAANG stocks
+ **the world rewards you for outcomes, not effort.** 
+ When you insist on working hard, even when it's not the most effective strategy, **you miss obvious solutions that are right in front of your eyes.**
+ Whenever you're trying to solve a problem, ask yourself: "What am I missing because it feels too stupid?"

> Writing about the precise quantification of time, John Gatto once said: "Bells destroy the past and future, rendering every interval the same as any other, as the abstraction of a map renders every living mountain and river the same, even though they are not."

#education #creativity 

+ school bells show how **the clock can crush the creative spirit.** You can't get lost in your work when you're hyper-aware of the clock.
+ To the creative mind, seconds are not equal. 
	+ An hour spent writing when you're sharp in the morning can be worth three hours of writing when you're tired in the evening. 
	+ An hour spent writing at the tail end of a retreat, when you have the context of an entire book loaded into your mind, can be worth ten hours of ordinary writing time.

**[You need a mission in life](https://www.radigancarter.com/dispatches/you-need-a-mission-in-life)**

To try doing: personal flywheel

> **How do you know you have a mission?**
> Do you want to do it more than you want to keep breathing?
> Are you that dedicated to it, that you value it more than the thought of continuing to live without it?
> If the answer is no, then you don’t have a mission, **you have a hobby.**

> **Your soul doesn’t crave a new espresso machine, ==it craves being at work in accomplishing the mission of your life==,** one where there it only ends when dancing pallbearers take you to your final resting place in a large above ground family crypt with plenty of sunlight streaming in so strangers walking through the cemetery know years later we didn’t live the same lives of their ancestors.
> We walk amongst those who just want to be normal, seek instant gratification, stare in their phones at fake outrage, have no standards, are inwardly ugly and outwardly miserable, forgetting what they were meant to do on this earth.
> We are not the same as them.
> **Our world is one of ==strength, freedom, responsibility, and building beauty== with vibrant colors.**

**[What if you just trusted yourself?](https://haleynahman.substack.com/p/what-if-you-just-trusted-yourself)**

> The famous neurologist, philosopher, and writer Oliver Sacks discovered that humans have far more senses than the classic five—taste, smell, touch, hearing, and sight.
> There’s also our ==sense of temperature, balance and time passing.== There’s our ==subconscious== and it often knows what we need better than intellect does.

> I’ve been thinking a lot about these **“gut feelings,” or the intelligence buried under our moods.** They’re the instincts that don’t necessarily line up with our more intellectual frameworks, which is why following them can feel risky or chaotic (backing away from that piece, in the moment, would have felt like giving up).
> But **when I think back to times I’ve dared to follow a gut instinct, ==they map almost perfectly to my most cherished decisions.==** Not just big ones, like moves and breakups, but even tiny ones, like haircuts and conversations with friends.

**[stop learning](https://www.nashvail.me/blog/stop-learning)**

> What do online courses, youtube tutorials, books about x skill, OnDeck fellowships, and graduate courses all have in common? **they delay action and discomfort from doing, while giving us the high of “productivity”.** Sure, they are great inputs to motivate you to action. And being around others acquiring the same skill sure helps. ==But they are no substitute for doing.==

> In Turning Pro, Steven Pressfield— the author— talks about something called **incapacity.** Incapacity starts with addiction.

> All addictions share two primary qualities:
> 1. They embody repetition without progress.
> 2. They produce **incapacity** as a payoff.

**[Why the classics?](https://octavian.substack.com/)**

> His thoughts on the alleged "impracticality" of the classics:
> **Reading great literature will prepare you for the truly human experiences** — love, grief, doubt, joy — in a way more superficially "practical" education will not.
> When your father dies, your accounting degree is not going to help you at all to process that experience. Homer will help you.

**[Life in the metaverse](https://reboothq.substack.com/p/metaverse)**

> **The point of the metaverse is not to create a more powerful digital opiate.** The point of the metaverse is not to manufacture digital status or extract more data from people. These are the current business models of the consumer internet, and would only lead to a metaverse as shallow, divisive, and invasive as the internet can be today. 
> I draw from three years, hundreds of nights, and thousands of conversations spent in social VR platforms. **Done right, the metaverse offers us recovery: an escape that helps people become more creative, empathetic, and connected. ==A renewal of community, imagination, and a return to humanity==**
