### Agency 
#### Marxism
> Men make their own history, but they do not make it as they please; they do not make it under self-selected circumstances, but ==under circumstances existing already==, given and transmitted from the past. The tradition of all dead generations weights like a nightmare on the brains of the living.
> 
> -- Karl Marx


> And just as they seem to be occupied with revolutionizing themselves and things, creating something that did not exist before, precisely in such epochs of revolutionary crisis they anxiously conjure up the spirits of the past to their service, borrowing from them names, battle slogans, and costumes in order to present this new scene in world history in time-honored disguise and borrowed language. Thus Luther put on the mask of the Apostle Paul, the Revolution of 1789-1814 draped itself alternately in the guise of the Roman Republic and the Roman Empire, and the Revolution of 1848 knew nothing better to do than to ==parody==, now 1789, now the revolutionary tradition of 1793-95. In like manner, the beginner who has learned a new language always translates it back into his mother tongue, but he assimilates the spirit of the new language and express himself freely in it only when he moves in it without recalling the old...

- enacting social change is like learning a new language
- there's a learning curve, it takes some time before you think in this new world order

#### Three Concepts of Agency
1. **Private:** Perry Anderson suggests that we can distinguish three ways in which human beings can be said to 'make history', each involving a different sort of goal for their activity. The first and most typical form of historical action is the pursuit of 'private' goals -- =='cultivation of a plot, choice of a marriage, exercise of a skill, maintenance of a home, bestowal of a name'.==
2. **Public:** The 2nd kind of agency, like the 1st, operates within the framework of existing social relations, pertaining to the kind of ventures involving 'public' goals, for example, =='political struggles, military conflicts, diplomatric transactions, commercial exlorations'==, that are the stuff of conventional narrative history.
3. **Global collective:** Finally, there is the 'unprecedented form of agency' involved in the collective pursuit of global social transformation, which first appeared in the American and French Revolutions but acquired full expression only with the emergence of the workers' movement and revolutionary Marxism: here, 'for the first time cllective projects of social transformation were ==married to systematic efforts to understand the processes of past and present, to produce a premediated future.=='

#### On Mode of Production
> The ==specific economic form, in which unpaid surplus-labour is pumped out of direct producers==, determines the relationship of rulers and ruled, as it grows directly out of production itself and, in turn, reacts upon it as a determining element. Upon this, however, is founded the formation of the economic community which grows out of the production relations themselves, thereby simultaneously its specific political form. It is always ==the direct relationships of the owners of the conditions of production to the direct producers== -- a relationship always naturally ==corresponding to a definite stage in the development== of the methods of labour and thereby its social productivity -- which reveals the innermost secret, the hidden basis of the entire social structure, and with it the political form of the relation of sovereignty and dependence, in short the corresponding specific form of the state.

- Unpaid surplus-labour -> the form of ==exploitation== in a particular society
	- How is unpaid labour extracted from the working class? In the past and the present
	- It replicates itself; it's generational
- **Relations of production:** where to locate exploitation â€” time, particular relationships *(think of the chronotype)*
- **Forces of production:** the different ways in which productivity is ensured
- **Extraction of surplus value:** people get rich by not paying others enough

#### The camera
> Cameras define reality in the two ways essential to the workings of an advanced industrial society: as a ==spectacle== (for masses) and as an object of ==surveillance== (for rulers).
> 
> -- Susan Sontag

#### The viewer
> The historical moment has arrived that allow us to grasp that ==looking is posited by capital as labor.== -- Jonathan Beller

> Cinema can be seen as part of an emerging ==cybernetic complex==, which, from the standpoint of an emergent global labor force, functions as technology for the ==capture and redirection== of global labor's revolutionary social agency and potentiality.
> 
> -- Jonathan Beller

- cybernetic: intersection of biology and technology

#### The camera and the viewer
> Needing to have reality confirmed and experience enhanced by photographs is an aesthetic consumerism to which everyone is now addicted. Industrial societies turn their citizens into ==image junkies==; it is the most irresistible form of mental pollution.
> 
> -- Susan Sontag 

#### 'Cinematic' mode of production
> It realizes capitalist tendencies toward the ==extension of the work day== (via entertainment, email), the ==deterritorialization of the factory== (through cottage industry, TV), the ==marketing of attention== (to advertisters), the building of ==media pathways== (formerly roads), and the ==retooling of subjects.==
