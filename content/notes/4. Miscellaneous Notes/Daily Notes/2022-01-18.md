## Irene Notes
IRENE NOTES
- antidote: just pick something in order to move forward
- deepen your skills and experience in something, could be anything, see what the universe brings to you
- cultivate choices, then make a choice
- summer before senior year is critical...opportunities at a startup or research lab...
- reach out to professors doing interesting research
-paths to abroad: graduate school or having a company sponsor your visa
- you may have to look for specific professors in order to get specific universities
- best litmus test: is this somehthing you feel really excited about? what makes your heart sing? what will help you grow? (find something that will burn you out because you love it so much).
- the ones who are most successful are singularly focused...
- aim to get at least 3
- ask yourself: what are you the most excited/curious about?
- strong/deep expertise > shallow generalist
