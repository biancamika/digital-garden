### Notes
+ **Pleasure Time**
	+ unstructured
	+ no sense that something should be happening
	+ openness to whatever happens
	+ not seeking to control what's happening
	+ Feelings that arise
+ Leisure as connection, to nature, to people, to inner self
+ "If you don't schedule maintenance time, it will be scheduled for you"
+ TED talk: Andrew Taggart on How Work took over the World
+ The pedestalization of work 
	+ [[Work can become a god in and of itself]]
+ Leisure doesn't feel like work
+ Wonderopolis: who invented weekends?
+ Time sensitivity
+ Buddhist Boddhisvata idea: doing work that feels urgent and happily taking it but from a place of wanting to, not from the obligation of shoulds
+ Hedonic treadmill, constant illusion that the next leap is the leap home
+ Don't be pressured to achieve at a young age
+ Comes from our inability to accept that we aren't immortal
+ Let go of what doesn't serve you...e.g. past selves
+ Who we are v.s. who we aim to be
+ Sunk cost fallacy
+ Give yourself permission to do less, and be less, and trust that it is enough and will be enough.
+ Kate Northup: Do Less
+ Treat the timeline as a stream of information, that you can take a sip from, no need to drown yourself. 
	+ Just like a buffet!
+ Restful rest vs mindless rest, active vs passive
+ The Oddysey: "there is a time for many worlds and there is a time for sleep"
