> The YouTuber Casey Neistat once said: “Expressing creativity using the most basic, accessible methods is the hardest thing to do and the purest. The very best steak houses serve their filet on a plate with nothing else. Shi*ty franchises cover theirs in sauce and other stuff to distract you from the fact that you’re eating dog food.”

### The Moral Theory of Confucius (551-479 BCE)
#### Homer Dubs, "Confucius: His Life and Teaching"
+ K'ung Fu Tzu 
+ First professional teacher of higher subjects in China
	+ Profession which Confucians have since esteemed and aspired to
	+ Made scholarship esteemed in China
		+ More books in China than the rest of the world (until modern times)
+ ==The service of the state== has been the great Confucian ideal and duty
+ **Objective:** To reform ==social and political life== and to relieve the ==suffering== of the common people
+ **Solution:** To revive the stress on ==moral education== and the observance of ==traditional rites==
+ begin with reform of individual person

> "The Ancients who wished to illustrate illustrious virtue throughout the kingdom, first ordered well their own states. Wishing to order well their states, they first regulated their families. Wishing to regulate families, ==they first cultivated their persons.==" - *Ta Hsueh (The Great Learning)*

> "The rites were not intended...to elicit particular kinds of behavior...the goal was to instill certain sensibilities, attitude and dispositons...The rites achieved this first by ==restraining excessive behavior== ina  way that instillted an attitude of humility in the practitioner." - *Philip J. Ivanhoe, Confucian Moral Self-Cultivation*

+ Reliance upon *li* (filial piety) was crucial in the view of prevailing politicla conditions during the time of Confucius. 
+ In contrast to rootless anarchy, *li* offered stabilizing roots to society, sunk deep into the soil of tradition.
+ Confucius didn't consider himself an innovator. Instead, he considered himself a ==reformer== advocating a return to the old ways and visions of ancient Chinese tradition.

#### Twofold Elements of Ancient Chinese Tradition
+ **Tao:** the way 
	+ the way of nature
	+ e.g. if you do not interfere with the seed, it will grow
	+ revealed by *yi*
	+ provides a universal and unwavering standard for judgement
+ **Te:** virtue
	+ human trait/quality considered as a gift or an endowment received by man from Heaven
	+ When *tao* acts in man, it becomes *te* or virtue and constitues his very attitude of mind and character

#### The Moral Tao
> "Have sincere faith and love learning. Be not afraid to die for pursuing the good way. Do not enter a tottering state nor stay in a chaotic one. When the *tao* prevails in the empire, show yourself; when it does not prevail, then hide."

> "When the *tao* prevails in your own state and you are poor and in a humble station, be ashamed of yourself. When the *tao* does not prevail in your state and you are wealthy and in an honorable position, be ashamed of yourself." - *Confucius, Analects*

> "Wealth and honor are what every man desires. ==Poverty and humble station are what every man dislikes.== But if they can be avoided only in violation of moral principles, they must not be avoided."

> "If a superior man departs from humanity, how can he fulfill that name? ==A superior man never abandons humanity== even for the lapse of a single meal. In moments of haste, he acts according to it. In times of difficulty, he acts according to it."

No excuses bitches

#### The Pursuit of Moral Character
+ **There is only one worthwhile purpose man can have in life. It is to be a good man, a complete or total man.**
	+ Is this pursuit possible?
+ **Chih:** a basic inclination to do what is right
	+ Human beings are by nature inclined toward the good, and if we reflect and accord with inclination, they will develop into full moral beings
+ **"a gift from above"**
	+ to develop oneself according to his nature is to fulfill a design inscribed by Heaven upon his heart
	+ *to follow the natural, therefore, is to obey Heaven, and to develop oneself is to serve Heaven*
+ **We are born with 'duans' or *sprouts*.**
	+ **Wen:** a nurturing, patterning, formative process
		+ The *chi* (a basic inclination to do what is right) is like a seed that needs to be nurtured and brought to fullness by man himself though a long process of *education* and *application*
	+ **Twofold Aspects of Wen**
		+ the gradual nature of the process
			+ should not be rushed
			+ naturally long and difficult
		+ the need for a certain environment
			+ an environment devoid of basic necessities and comforts, godo examples, and proper encouragement will prove impossible to overcome
			+ people will fail to develop natural moral sensibilities
+ **The moral man is the fully developed man who has the two elements - the natural endowment *(chi)* and the formative, refining process *(wen)* - combined in a harmonious balance.**
+ **Education, *Jiaoyu***
	+ how cultivation of morals happens
	+ Etymology words
		+ **Jiao:** teaching
		+ **Yu:** nurturing
	+ consists of study of ancient Chinese literature, repository of human wisdom and moral insight

> Education is not merely for the purpose of conveying knowledge, but also for shaping correct behavior patterns and internalizing them as part of one's character...A teacher's duty is not merely to teach, but also to serve as a model of ethical behavior. - Jiyuan  Yu, 

+ **Chun-Tzu**: the gentleman, the complete/superior man
	+ Nobility is a quesiton of conduct/character
	+ **Ren:**: humaneness
		+ sense of connaturality/respect, love and good will toward fellow amn
		+ most important moral quality
		+ Confucius uses this to refer to human relations; stresses social nature of virtue
		+ One rule Confucius recommends: the rule of the *shu*
			+ Using oneself as an analogy for arriving at what others like and dislike
			+ just a heuristic tool for putting into action the positive element, *Chung* (doing one's best in love of fellow man)
		+ Related values
			+ rectification of names (ching ming)
			+ Filial piety
	+ **Chih:** wisdom
		+ possession of two combined elements for learning (hsueh) and thinking (ssu)
		+ absorbinng learning isn't enough...it must be applied
	+ **Yung:** courage
		+ the overcoming of fear/indifference in pusuit of what is right

> "There are three things constantly on the lips of the gentleman none of which I have succeeded in the following: A man of humaness never worries, a man of wisdom is never of two minds, a man of courage is never afraid."
