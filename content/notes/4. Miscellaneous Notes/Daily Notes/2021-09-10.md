Post a screenshot of the doughnuts of the countries you compared and in 3-5 sentences post your takeaway by 10 September.

I chose to compare the Philippines and Singapore because they're both Southeast Asian countries on opposites sides of the development spectrum (third-world versus first-world). This difference can be seen in their models' social foundations; ours has a lot of shortfalls below social thresholds, while theirs is mostly full. However, their social performance comes at the cost of environmental sustainability, since they've overshot most of their biophysical boundaries. Overall, this graph showed me that taking care of citizens and the environment is a fine line to balance; thus, governments must exercise caution while conceiving of initiatives for developing their countries.
