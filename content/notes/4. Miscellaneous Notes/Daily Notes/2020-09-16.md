### Braindump

##### Inventor of Traditions
- modernity = contemporary
- modernity = self-mystification (intentional confusion -> jargon) of the fact that "we have never been modern"
	- any notion of *alternative modernities* must be rejected -> we have always been traditional
- **Alternative modernities:** characterization of a particular form of articulation between peripheral societies in the world system and centrally initiated capitalist processes
	- basically the integration of world societies and capitalism
	- Vary along two axes:
		- degree of ==transformative integration== into the global system
		- representations of the ==center as future, wealth, and well-being== (+ strategies) 
- So what really is **modernity?**
	- Alterity of modernities: ==result of new set of mixtures + contemporary sameness, spread across the world==
	- COMBINATORIAL in nature
	- all alternative forms are variations on the same basic themes: =="structures of common difference"==
	- cluster of phenomena that may or may not be systematically related to one another
- [[Where the future fades, people tend to invest in the past]].
	- Result: ethnification + cultural fragmentation
- even if the objects and actors are different, the mode of going about identifying others and the central issue of wealth accumulation and inequality is admittedly part of the =="old" logic==.
	- but this new introduction is crucial to modernity (the contemporary aspect)
#### Progress
- typical terms/fragments like nation-state and capitalism are associated with modernity because they act as ==signs?==
	- aspects of a ==unitary process== that inflects them all in a particular way (Friedman 1994)
- **Alterity:** founding dynamic of modernism
	- worldview where identity is reduced into a social role
	- springs from the fracturing of the person into ==private subject and public identity==
- Evolutionism: ordering of world in terms of degrees of ==developmental success==
	- can be equated to individual success
- Modernity: rationalist, universalist, progressive?
	- See [[Metamodernism]]
- The way people ==identify== over time is a function of ==global systemic processes.==
- ==Global/local relation:== double process of TRANSFORMATION
	- ==incorporation== of local structures into the reproductive cycles of an expanding capitalist system
	- cultural ==assimilation== of imported relations, cateogires, and objects into local strategies
- **Types of Transformation:**
	- local change is organized but initiated + challenged by global relations
		- Bigman strategies
			- E.G. Hawaii's entire society being replaced by colonial America
	- local structures replaced by dominant power
#### Political
- "==Revolutions== are linked to local dreams of progress, images of a future" -> French Revolution
- Confusion of contemporaneity and modernity
	- contemporary = RIGHT NOW
	- doesn't exactly mean it's a modern idea
	- "Capitalist penetration dissolves moral and other forms of social control and community is ==not identical to the politics of 'progress'".==
- E.G. of public identity = citizenship
	- a center of the world is created, but at the cost of individualization
	- The world is one because ==capitalism is now globalized.==
- "revolution" is made by ==capital==, and not by those who would oppose it
##### Economic
- modernity = set of modern products, specifically products of capitalism
- Spitulnik tries to avoid "modernity" as an indicator of progress due to its ethnocentricity
- things of outside world -> life processes of the local social order
- modernity is continuously restructured (==discursive space==)
- commercial capitalism = introduced new form of differentiation of wealth
- consumption is a primary means of ==social self-definition==
	- So...to be modern = to consume?
		- whether you consume media, culture, etc. if you're out of the loop, you're seen as not modern
- Modernity: ==cultural field of commercial capitalism, its emergent identity space==.
- Everyone who participates in ==world capitalism== is part of modernity
- driving force of change: ==globalization==  itself, the speeding up of circulation of goods, images, information, T-shirts, and cults, etc.
- capitalism = cultural phenomenon
- modernity as the contemporanous: integration within ==capitalist world  economy==
##### Intellectual
- modernity = cultural space
- Modernity: ==transhistorical== structure
- ^ consumption can apply here as well
	- E.G. The Enlightment: to be enlightened you had to consume
- ^ capitalism too
- globlization goes together with =="cultural continuity"==
- modernity in structural sense is the ==cultural parameters== of capitalist experience space, outgrowth of ==commodification of social relations.==
#### Myth of Contemporary Europe
- modernity= leading sector/region
- Desire for the things or the life, ==objectified in images of the West,== does not require the term "modernity".
- ==relations to Western goods== -> local gender relations + local interpretations of objects (also capitalist)
	- cultural assimilation (e.g. colonial mentality?)
- what is modernist in one place may be reactionary in another
	- e.g. fundamentalist Christianity is only traditionalist with respect to certain forms of social control
	- it's happening right now, but it's not exactly modern
- true ==ethnography==: venturing into native territory without the interference of the larger context (a.k.a. Eurocentrism)
- Europe is a center of capitalist accumulation
- There are many different ways of appropriating Western products that aren't contained within Western cultural logics
	- E.G. potlatching w/ sewing machines
		- not a different way of being modern, but a different way of ==connecting to a larger world.== 
- To ==identify continuity== is to ==deny the absolute contemporaneity and coevalness== of the entirety of the world's populations.
	- Basically, trying to find consistency through defining modernity makes us exclude others

### Takeaways (TL;DR)
- modernity shouldn't be equated to a globalized world
- because its definition is so contextual... see *alternative modernities*
- if we try to find consistency/unity within modernity, we'll just end up excluding others
