### Dreaming
> [O]ur reaction reveals as much about ourselves as it does about the movie we react against. It is, in part, a reflection of the extent of our ==alienation== from the mass of Filipinos who make up the *bakya* crowd. We cannot appreciate mass culture, we cannot even view it with sympathy and understanding, because we have been — by our social origins, our educational background, our cultural orientation — to regard as inane and inept whatever does not measure up to our exalted ==notions of art and culture.==

> [E]lectronic media] are resources for experiments with self-making in all sorts. They allow scripts for possible lives to be imbricated with the glamour of film stars and fantastic film plots and yet also to be tied to the plausibility of news shows, documentaries, and other black-and-white forms of telemediation and printed text. Because of the sheer multiplicity of the forms in which they appear (cinema, television, computers, and telephones) and because of the rapid way in which they move through daily life routines, electronic media provide resources for ==self-imagining as an everyday social project.==

> — Arjun Appadurai

> The image, the imagined, the imaginary — these are all terms that direct us to something critical and new in global cultural processes: the ==imagination as a social practice.== No longer mere fantasy (opium for the masses whose real work is elsewhere), no longer simple escape (from a world defined principally by more concrete purposes and structures), no longer elite pastime (thus not relevant to the lives of ordinary people), and no longer mere contemplation (irrelevant for new forms of desire and retroactivity), the imagination has become an organized field of social practices, a form of work (in the sense of both labor and culturally organized practice), and a form of negotiation between sites of agency (individuals) and globally defined fields of possibility. This unleashing of the imagination links the play of pastiche (in some settings) to the terror and coercion of states and their competitors. ==The imagination is now central to all forms of agency, is itself a social act, and is the key component of the new global order.==

#### Five major dimensions of cultural flow
1. **Ethnoscapes:** the landscape of persons who constitute the shifting world in which we live: tourists, immigrants, exiles, guestworkers, and other moving groups and persons... and appear to affect the politics of and between nations to a hitherto unprecedented degree
2. **Technoscapes:** the global configuration, ever fluid, of technology, and of the fact that technology, both high and low, both mechanical and informational, now moves at high speeds across various kinds of previously impervius boundaries.
3. **Financescapes:** "the disposition of global capital", as seen in currency markets, stock exchanges, and commodities
4. **Mediascapes:** the distribution of the electronic capabilities to produce and disseminate information (newspapers, magazines, television stations, film production studios, etc.)... and to the images of the world created by these media
5. **Ideoscapes:** ideologies of states and counter-ideologies of movements explicitly oriented to capturing state power or a piece of it
