- **Dikw Pyramid:** a model for representing structural relationships between data, information, knowledge and wisdom
	- Data is the bottom (1)
		- raw facts/basic stimuli
		- e.g. Red
	- Information is the bottom middle (2)
		- useful data
		- e.g. Red means stop
	- Knowledge is the top middle (3)
		- meaningful information
		- e.g. Traffic light has turned red
   - Wisdom is the top (4)
	   - e.g. I should stop because it turned red
- Designer: data -> information; consumer: knowledge -> wisdom
