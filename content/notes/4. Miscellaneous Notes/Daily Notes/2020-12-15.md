### Justice in Scriptures
- The Conversion of St. Augustine
- God's Special Revelation in Scripture
> As one of the special ways in which God reveals himself, ==Scripture== is considered as one of the 4 sources of doing theology, the other 3 being ==Tradition== (which, together with Scripture, form one deposit of Divine Revelation), ==Experience== (which we identified in Module 1 as the starting point of theology and of the Pastoral Circle), and ==Reasoning== (which uses the contributions of philosophy, social sciences, and other disciplines, including their insights on Social Analysis which we consider as the 2nd step of the Pastoral Circle method in Module 1). 
- **Overview of Justice**
- **Creation**
Normal
> On one hand, the insertion of the 1st story of creation, one of the last to be composed, at the beginning of the entire Bible introduces the themes of divine concern for creatures, the dignity of human beings, and the orderly division of creation into different habitats for different creatures, different times for different activities, and the importance of honoring God (during the 7th day or Sabbath day) in difficult times as well as moments of celebration.
> On the other hand, the 2nd creation story highlights the importance of relationships: God makes all the other creatures in an effort to provide a suitable companion for the human (v. 18). Only another human can offer that companionship, which finds its ultimate expression in marriage. 

Theologican
> At the beginning of the video, Bishop Barron answers the question, "Why does God create?" by quoting Vatican I's answer, ==". . . so as to manifest and share his glory." ==
> However, in the video below, theology professor Fr. Michael Himes, makes an interesting clarification on this answer by Vatican I and suggests a more satisfying answer which is worth listening to and reflecting upon. As you watch, take note of the theological shorthand for that reality which brings the universe into existence.
- Our Responsibility as "Images of God"
> In this final video related to Creation, let us reflect on our responsibility as people created in the "image of God," a theme that runs throughout the bible, culminating in Jesus Christ as our model of being new human, the one who exemplifies to us what it truly means to be an "image of God."  ==We are called to be a sign and instrument of God’s love, as individuals, and as a community of persons. We are called to reflect the perfect community of the Trinity in our social relationships.==

1. What specific theological view or religious truth conveyed by the 2 stories of creation in Genesis strike you the most?
3. How does this view/truth broaden my perspective about the nature of justice and the nature of God and all his creation in general?

The religious truth that struck me the most was that science/philosophy and religion go together. This is because of the assumption that most religious people are unscientific (e.g. vouching for Creation over Big Bang theory). This view broadens my perspective by making me realize that believing in God doesn't necessarily mean you have to restrict your world view. You can help contribute to the world through scientific/philosophical means (we are co-creators after all) while still believing in God.

### Original Sin
1.  Why is there sin and evil in the world?
The Bible teaches that sin and evil come not from God who created everything good, but from the willful disobedience of man who abused his God-given freedom at the dawn of history.
2. What does “original sin” mean?
“Original sin” can refer to two things:
•the first “originating sin” which brought evil and brokenness into the world; or 
•“originated sin,” or the actual sinful state into which we are born, the essence of which is the privation of sanctifying grace, and some of whose consequences are evident in the outside  sinful  situation (sin of  the  world),  and  the inner  effect  of  disordered  desires (concupiscence) we all experience within us.
3. What does Genesis teach about original sin? 
Genesis narrates the primordial account of the “originating sin” of Adam and Eve and its consequences for them as well as in the spread of evil in order to account for the evil which we all experience today.

4. What were the practical consequences of the first sin?
From the Genesis narrative, in rebelling against God, the man and the woman destroyed their original harmony with:
- each other (“they realized they were naked”),
- others (Cain murdered his brother Abel),
- the community (Tower of Babel),
- nature (“cursed be the ground…”),
and incurred death (“dirt you are and to dirt you shall return”).
5. What does Genesis add to many contemporary solutions to our social problems?
To today's social science approach to bringing peace, justice, and improved economic conditions, Genesis adds a serious consideration of the presence of SIN, and the “consequent monumental struggle against the powers of darkness which pervades our whole human history” (GS 37).
Put simply , effective programs for improving social conditions must face and work to overcome the deeper causes of social evils: our wounded human nature, our inclination to self-centeredness, which Genesis reveals.
6. What is the connection between original sin and death?
The science behind sin - The Boston Globe
Death as we know it -  the ultimate test of our lives, shrouded in mystery and thus often a source of deep fear and dread -  is due to sin, not God's intention.  God did not make death nor does he rejoice in the destruction of the living” Wis. 1:13-14. But with St. Paul, we hold that “Christ won the victory when he rose to life, for by his death he freed us from death” (1 Cor 15:57; GS 18).
7. How does Church teaching explain original sin? 
The Church clarifies that we do not inherit Adam’s personal sin, but its consequences, that is that as members of the human race, we are born deprived of sanctifying grace, into the sinful condition in the world with our weakened human nature resulting from his sin.
8. What is meant by “concupiscence”?
Concupiscence is that deep-seated disorder in our appetites and drives that is the root-cause of many of our personal and social sins; through God’s redeeming grace we are strengthened to overcome this disorder within us.
9. What is meant by “capital sins”?
Capital or “root sins” are basic evil inclinations or disvalues (pride, lust, anger, gluttony, envy, covetousness, sloth) which are the origin of many sinful thoughts, words or deeds. They manifest the evil tendencies within each of us which are the effect of original sin.
10. How does Baptism “take away original sin”?
Baptism “takes away original sin” by bringing to the baptized the gift of the Holy Spirit, God’s saving, sanctifying presence. 

The indwelling Holy Spirit in the baptized makes them adopted sons/daughters of the Father, coheirs with Jesus Christ, and incorporates them into his Body the Church.

1. Which biblical event/passage we have covered so far inspires you the most to be just and help create a more just society? Why?

2. How can you apply this passage in your own life and bring about a positive change in your  perspectives, values, or lifestyle.

A biblical event/passage that's definitely inspired me to practice justice is Jesus' sacrifice: taking the wound of humanity just to heal us. It's the most selfless thing I can think of; imagine helping those who hurt you. That's really justice at work. I want to apply this to my own life by practicing this with other people. "Do unto others what you want done unto you". E.G. Being gracious with others even if they aren't. Don't treat people the way you're treated. Treat people the way you want to be treated.

1. Currently, I feel like I am living self-centeredly. My treasure (money) is usually spent on impulse purchases for myself; I donate, but not as much as I have before. Since money is my top priority (worry for finances), this has led me to spending my time and talent in work, even if this detriments me.  
2. The specific strategies I can use to allot more of my time, talent and treasure to help uplift the lives and conditions of the poor and marginalized are time-blocking, weekly reviews, and budgeting. These all make use of reflection and planning, which can help me be more mindful. By being more mindful, I can allot more of my time, talent, and treasure to those in need.
3. My immersion sector is PDL: persons deprived of liberty, a.k.a. prisoners. These people may have done personal sins like theft, murder, etc. that landed them in jail. However, there are also social sins like police violence and corruption. On one end of the spectrum, this manifests as innocent people becoming prisoners due to being accused of drug peddling (knowing how Duterte is very anti-drugs). On the other hand, this manifests as unjust alliances between inmates and jail guards through bribery.
4. These social sins create an environment encouraging personal sins. Thus, they reinforce each other. It becomes an endless cycle of sin.
5. I believe these social sins can be replaced with life-giving structures by overhauling prisons to encourage rehabilitation over punishment. This in line with the Christian belief that all of us have value, being made in God's image. By treating PDL with the respect they deserve, we can breathe life into a sinful place.
