### CONSCIENCE: Man is called to do the good
*Based on: **O’Connell, Understanding Conscience***

TL;DR:
1. **Conscience/1:** characteristic
2. **Conscience/2:** process
3. **Conscience/3:** event

#### The experience of conscience
**The experience of conscience** (especially Conscience/1) is a good starting point because it's ==experiential==, and it reveals something fundamental about the =="default design" of man==

1. **The basic experience**
	1. Attraction towards good 
	2. The "good" understood on different levels
	3. Man's attraction to "good" is like the phototropic quality of plants
		1. Plants are attracted to the sun because it enables them to surive
		2. Part of the plants' "design"
		3. Doesn't reflect choice, but "design", just like with man
		4. =="Moral phototropism":== man is attracted towards the good because it is in the doing of the good that man becomes most fully himself.
2. This experience leads us to observe that there is a **connaturality between man and value**
	1. Connaturality: connected by nature
	2. E.G. Cellphone and SIM card, diesel engine and diesel fuel
	3. Means more than "bagay"; they are designed to function together
	4. This is the claim we make regarding moral phototropism
3. Machines have an **instruction manual**, while we humans did not come with this
	1. So how do we know the design of man? This is done by reflecting on the experience of conscience
4. What is the **experience of conscience?** 
	1. The experience of...
		1. Being drawn towards the good and being repelled by evil
		2. Fulfillment and satisfaction when we do good, etc
		3. Inner conflict and turmoil when we violate the good that we know
	2. Similar to voltage and "reaction"
	3. Sense of responsibility for the decision that one makes
5. What does this tell us about **the “design”  of the human person, what he ought to become, the Christian understanding of the human person,** in other words?
	1. Man becomes most fully himself in the doing of the good
	2. Man was designed to be fulfilled and satisfied in doing the good
	3. Man was "designed" refers to a creator, better to the Creator
	4. SIN, the doing of evil (violating good) is self-destructive
	5. "Doing of evil" not merely violation of the law, but also destruction or non-realization of a value, and ultimately the human person


#### Conscience as PROCESS
- demanded by the human characteristic
- even if we want to do good, this isn't always clear. why?
	- competing values (e.g. loving v.s. disciplining child)
	- ambiguous culture (e.g. seeking revenge obstructs the value of forgiveness)
	- incomplete knowledge (e.g. radioactive substances & the Curie couple)
	- changing circumstances (e.g. function of money from medium of exchange to productive good)
- our hold of the truth is ==fragile, tentative, and not quite absolute==
- this means that we need to be humble; there's always possibility for error and we need to adapt; ==constantly examine and re-examine our norms== (e.g. age of criminal responsibility)
- This responsibility is constant and societal
- What does a **sincere and concrete conscience** mean?
	- Sincerity: subjective quality of an individual who searches for the truth
	- Correctness: conformity to the objective good, "almost" the end-result of sincerity
- ^ Related
	- a sincere conscience always seeks to be correct....always seeking information/enlightenment (v.s. blissful ignorance)
	- sincerity may result in "objective" correctness, but not always
- The **Magisterium of the Church** are important in this process (seeking enlightenment)
	- long history of teaching and upholding moral values
	- trans-cultural character avoids cultural bias/narrowness
	- presence of Holy Spirit guides and enlightens the Church
- What does this process say about the **human person**? (Christian anthropology)
	-   It emphasizes the responsibility of the individual to consult and to be open to change; to have a well-formed and well-informed conscience.  
	- It underscores the centrality of stable fundamental **values**, as compared to **norms** that concretize and enforce these values.
	- ==norms may change; values remain==

#### Conscience as event/judgement
*concerning the good to be done or the evil to be avoided*

1. **The event itself**
	1. When we talk about "following my conscience", or that "my conscience is clear", etc...it is ==conscience/3== that we refer to
	2. It is the concrete judgement of a specific person in a specific situation
	3. Therefore, it is not ==universal==
	4. Conscience does not legislate norms but it applies the norms to a concrete situation (making it a proximate norm)
	5. Judgement of conscience is ==morally infallible==
		1. does not obviate/exclude objective or factual error
	6. What it means that the person acting according to best interests cannot be accused of acting in bad aith, immorally, or commiting a sin
		1.  Because a person's most ==serious obligation== is to do the good he knows, to follow a well-formed conscience
	7. ==Relationship== of Conscience/3 and the Magist of the Church
		1. the person must follow his consience because the Magist is exercised by human beings who can be ==subject to error==
		2. ==Autonomy of conscience:== man must make that decision himself; he cannot pass on the responsibility to anyone else
			1. If man is not held responsible, he is treated like a child, not taken seriously, robbed of dignity as a human person
2. **What does this say about the human person?**
	1. "Man's dignity lies in observing this law and by it he will be judged"
	2. ==Moral infallibility of conscience:== the moral quality of our judgements and the actions that follow thereform is determined by how much they conform with the judgement of a well-formed and well-informed conscience, the good as we know it
	3. A person's moral responsibility: to follow a ==well-formed== (honest, sincere) and ==well-informed== (correct) conscience
		1. Also implies a "prior" responsibility that the person must ensure his conscience follows this
		2. If the conscience is not well-informed, then it does not deserve the obedience that we say we owe it
		3. What if we emphasize the need for objective good...and trust decision making to external agents...we would end up making a false god, robbing people of their dignity
	4. The supremacy of conscience/3 is that the obligation of the human person (see above ^) underscores the ==DIGNITY OF THE PERSON==
		1. The person must make the judgement himself that he knows is in his conscience, and is ultimately responsible for that decision, and eventually for the kind of person that he will become

#### TL;DR
what conscience says about the "design" of the human person
		1. ==Conscience/1 (the experience of conscience):== indicates that man becomes most fully himself in the doing of the good
		2. ==Conscience/2 (conscience as process):== emphasizes the responsibility of the person to ensure that the conscience is well-formed (honest, sincere) and well-informed (correct)
		3. ==Conscience/3 (judgement):== underscores the dignity of the human person. The person decides and is ultimately responsible for the decision that he makes. He cannot pass on that responsibility to anyone else.
