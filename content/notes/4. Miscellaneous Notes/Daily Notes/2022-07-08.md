### Race in Cyberspace
#### On Objectivity and Harmless Play
- progressively immersive and interactive play
- intersection of race, representation, gaming activity, and new media commercialization
- play and discourse; gaming's interactive function that might be thought to intensify attitudes about racial difference; power to habituate gamers (both designers and players) to sexist and racist narrative structures
- race and mastery of the game; successful play
- an essential/privileged male gaming subject, "universalized" under the sign of whiteness

> Race was the ==structured absence== in the latest iteration of generation gap politics between parent and youth culture; "[t]he unmarked category against which difference is constructed...never has to speak its name, never has to acknowlege its role as an organizing principle"

#### Encryption/Decryption
- ideologies of difference construct practices of difference; potent constructs with sinister cultural causes and consequences
- games can be seen as reaffirming dominant and partriarchal conceptions of gender roles; fostering a culture of violence, especially against women, as acceptable
- it is crucial to be cautious against necessarily equating violent, misogynist, and racist gameplay with real-world behavioral effects
- however, it's important to address the risks and potential cultural injury inherent in the circulation of discourse within gaming and mass media; "the legacy of racism in the US"

> "Because the video game industry privileges 'boys in their pre- and early teen' years... my mature, black, female body is marked and thus marginalized as a shadow consumer" 

#### High-tech Blackface and Orientalism
- Blackface
	- estrangement/stereotyping: no characters "looked or behaved anything like him"
	- **market-centered perspective:** the racial and ethnic shorthand behind nonwhite characters might be intended for white computer gamers...[who] hunger for this experience
	- by inhabiting the *soul* of the virtual black character in a game, they can safely get a taste of urban-inspired cool (phrasing betrays idea)
	- still, this fails to address *structural racism*
	- racial diversity as a selling tool; at times, sex
	- gaming culture's...redployment of dominant culture's distillation of racial blackness down to criminality, violence, and victimhood
	- importance of *getting it right*, but for who?
	- lingering questions: authenticity and audience
- Orientalism
	- similar issues arise when it comes to Asians
	- persistence of Orientalism; homogenization of Asian diversity in the Western imaginary
	- "We are having *fun* with...Asian Culture"
	- "If this game offends you...go play another game"; judgement ultimately deferred to consumer tastes and preferences
	- Orientalism depends for its strategy on this flexible positional relationship with the Orient without ever losing him the upper hand
	- [F]etishistic encoding of superior Asian martial arts skill VS derogatory codifications of Asians
	- While readers/audiences can and do actively resist dominant plot structures, one can argue that part of the pleasure is reading the plot "correctly" and as intended; to get a win
	- The Occidental *self* VS the Oriental *other*
- Colonialism
	- The danger in gaming's "cultural re-inscriptions" is that, within particular social and economic contexts, the recognition of specific allusions makes certain intertextual relations payoff
	- [Results in the] reinforcement of dominant culture's racist hegemony[;] redeployment and reification of specious racial difference for new generations and...new media culture industries
	- Nearly every video game *hero* is/was white
	- Gaming's narratological and ideological recrudecence of Western colonialism and imperialism's white masculinist hegemony
	- In some strategy games, for example, "in the imaginary" colonialist realm, to say "native" is to automatically say "evil", implicitly or not
	- It is one of the functions of ideology to "naturalize" social reality, to make it seem as innocent and unchangeable as Nature itself
	- Ideology seeks to convert culture to Nature, and the 'natural' sign is one of its weapons
	- Recasting neocolonialism as peaceful, spreading the necessary light of the West

#### RTFM: Reading Clearly
- RTFM: Read the Fucking Manual
- Young white males as ideal consumers
- Privileging of white game characters
- Commercial imperatives make it difficult for the gaming industry to break out of [current] dominant culture's discursive formations
- However, this does not mean negotiated and oppositional reading practices do not exist
