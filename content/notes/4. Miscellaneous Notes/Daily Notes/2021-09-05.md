On John Gertner's *The Idea Factory*, which covers the history of Bell Labs
#innovation 
> **Innovation happens in problem-rich environments.** And conversely, in the absence of interesting demanding problems to solve in the market, meaningful innovation stops.

> First, if you can't build and distribute the new thing to lots of people, the circle of innovation can't complete.

> The second more interesting implication is that **if there isn't a ready market in demand of what you've just built, you haven't innovated.** You've perhaps discovered or invented something interesting, but innovation, at least by this definition, requires some impact on society which isn't possible without **large-scale transformative adoption.**

> To deliver on an innovative knowledge tool, I think this space of tool-builders as a whole needs to acknowledge that the world mostly does not care about knowledge management or tools for thought, and contend with that reality as we try to deliver attractive, accessible tools that improve people's lives in ways they truly care about.

On tools for thought

> Merely "shipping" interesting projects and raising lots of venture capital will not do. Innovation doesn't happen in GitHub repositories or in Twitter threads of thought leaders du jour. It happens on desks and in pockets of millions and billions of humans navigating their own, varied lives, and the tools that win will be those that end up on their desks and in their pockets. And to do that, I think it's worth taking some of the voracious energy that's been going into creating and imagining new solutions, and redirecting it to understand why, if these new inventions are so great, many people simply run their lives on their iPhone's Notes app.

So true

> innovation is the act of making the possible, probable.

Speculative design relation?

+ Jane McGonical, PhD game designer: games engage us because they put us in that “perfect state between feeling bored and feeling overwhelmed.”
+ a.k.a. the psychological state of flow
+ To go into flow, you need 3 things:
	+ Clear goals
	+ Unambiguous feedback
	+ A "Goldilocks” challenge—not too easy, not too hard
+ Most importantly, you can’t go into flow if you’re doing it for money or attention. You need an activity that you find **intrinsically rewarding.**
+ Unlike games, classrooms aren’t designed for flow:
	+ Goals aren’t obvious to kids, even with great lesson plans
	+ Feedback is ambiguous; they see displeased teachers, but they’re not sure why
	+ Challenges feel forced and arbitrary, not inherently interesting
+ **“pointsification"**: focusing on status and rewards instead of task
	+ Different from [gamification](https://email.mg2.substack.com/c/eJw9kEtuwyAQQE8TdrH42IAXLLrpNawxDA6qDRbgVL59cRJVQgyfGR7zLFRcUj7Nnkol1zTVc0cT8besWCtmchTMU3BGjIprzokzvWN60CSUyWfEDcJqaj6Q7Me8Bgs1pHgVcMp6Sh5mGJ2Qygo9eKc5HXvreAvSO6ckp_yNhcMFjBYNPjGfKSJZzaPWvdzE141_twEe5owLdDZtbbud93lNS1stsAX_Ad-f5b6nEGv5PyKhfYUzOlLBhFA961inhBLej0x5j1xSPTqgPchBaoUcJN56ui28K8dcKtifC0mymQNE22A_wLhuKcvV--uutT61uB0x1HPCCPOK7m2lvt2-PE0LRszNuZugGiYFlU2BFEqzt4Wmraeaj2IQpMFdalXRQIQ15fbqx8AfPPmS6A)
+ **How to design great learning challenges**
	+  Set up unnecessary obstacles for kids to voluntarily tackle
	+ Use themes your kids like
	+ Pick the right level of difficulty
	+ Select authentic rewards
