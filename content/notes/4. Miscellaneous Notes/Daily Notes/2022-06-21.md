### Philippine Cinema and Society
Three main areas of studies:
- The film text
- The audience
- The industrial structure in the context of history, society, and culture

#### History: Industry and Audience
- **The Cinematic Encounter: Beginnings and Transformations**
	- Philippine cinematic history begins with short films
- **Cinema as Colonial Technology**
	- In the wake of America's victory in the Pacific, the cinema entrenched itself in the islands as colonial technology.
	- Ethnographic films were made about the Philippines
		- cockfights, processions
		- gold mining in Paracale to the construction of the Manila Hotel
	- 3 important aspects of filmmaking:
		- censorship
		- the imposition of government taxes
		- international distribution
	- 3 developments that enmeshed Philippine cinema in the matrix of State and free market control mechanisms:
		- The Board of Cinematographic Censorship
			- Taboo topics: divorce, adultery, seduction, free love, sexual perversity
		- Taxes on picture-projecting devices were imposed on 1915
			- kinetoscopes, biographs, cinematographs, magic lanterns
		- In 1912, American film companies started to establish their distribution agencies in the country; the French company Pathe Freres institued theirs in 1915
- **Cinema as Hollywood Industry**
	- Early Philippine cinema stood at the intersection of ==colonial theater and Hollywood, elitist resistance and a growing film public, folk traditions and foreign technology==
	- Notions of genre and the star system would gradually take over the industry
	- PH romance, action, comedy, and fantasy would take on post-colonial dimensions
		- they dealt w/ tradition and the dislocation made possible by capital formation
- **Cinema as Nostalgia for Nation**
	- The Japanese Occupation made the industry realize that cinema as a social institution had power, seen by the State as a potent medium which must be reined in through censorship and unleashed through propaganda
		- Stage shows
		- Strict censorship guidelines
	- Guerilla-garrison genre
		- Japanese atrocities and the celebration of Yankee liberation and guerila struggle
	- Nostalgia for nation, a sense of mourning for the things lost in war
- **Cinema as Social Decadence and Dissent**
	-

**Guide Questions:**
-   What do we see on screen? What happens in the film? What do they signify?  How does the film create meaning?
-   What is the milieu of the film’s story, and of the film? What are the characteristics of this world/ these worlds? How will knowing its milieu enrich our understanding of the work?

#### Answer
##### Outline
**For Land from God:**
- Intro
	- line that encapsulates my appreciation: "An elder was asked, So where do you get your knowledge? And the elder answered, From the ancestors, from the land, from the time of creation." 
	- Why? 
		- it shows why they value their land so much...it's a gift to them
- Body
	- Form and content
		- TL;DR:
		- The title of the film comes from promised land, the biblical concept
	- Millieu (environment and social surroundings)
		- It's not just the Ati tribe. IPs are always being treated as the other, by both their fellow citizens and their own government.
		- Citizens
			- being made fun of in school for their looks
			- working class people
		- Duterte
			- 2018 was also the year Duterte started his Boracay rehab projects. He called it a cesspool, which was probably caused by its overdevelopment as a tourist attraction
			- surprisingly he gave the Ati their land
			- maybe it's for the sake of appearance?
			- because his treatment of IPs are terrible...
	- Director and means of production
		- Director Kevin Piamonte is Illongo
			- an outsider's perspective
		- "We will always be humbled by the experience this Ati village in Boracay gave us."
	- Reception
		- According to Letterboxd reviews, the film was able to get its message across despite the awkward storytelling
- Conclusion
	- humility....
	- we should be more aware next time we're travleling?

##### Writing 
Near the end of *Land of God*, this quote is shown on a black screen: "An elder was asked, So where do you get your knowledge? And the elder answered, From the ancestors, from the land, from the time of creation." This piece of dialogue best encapsulates my appreciation of the film because it showed me the motivation behind the Ati tribe advocating for their rights; it's because they're humble enough to admit that their ancestral lands and cultural heritage are the foundations of their knowledge. Thus, they work in protecting these in their own ways:  legally fighting for their land rights, teaching Ati children in school, upholding local traditions. However, the tribe is seen as the [Other](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Other_(philosophy)#Imperialism_and_colonialism) by their fellow citizens and government: they get made fun for their looks, they're considered unsightly for tourists, and they're seen as difficult to hire (because of factors like lacking social skills, inadequate education). Even if there've been some outside efforts that have helped the tribe, like [President Duterte distiributing a portion of Boracay to them](https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/11/08/18/duterte-distributes-land-to-ati-tribe-in-boracay), I can't help but feel that it's all optics; if the President truly cared about their rights, why does this not apply to other IPs like the Lumads? Thankfully, this film is different. Even if the director is also an outsider (being Illongo), he spotlighted many voices, from the marginalized tribe members to their gracious supporters. He recognized that he had a lot to learn from them (instead of the other way around), saying: ["We will always be humbled by the experience this Ati village in Boracay gave us."](https://www.facebook.com/1935087663246115/posts/direk-kevin-piamonte-visits-the-ati-village-in-boracay-as-part-of-his-christmas-/2733024816785725/) I think we, the audience, can also be humbled by this film because many of us take our surroundings for granted. What if we treated nature and culture as treasured gifts, instead of things we can simply consume for our own benefit?






In the film *Filipinos Retreat from Trenches* (1899), the gesture that best encapsulated my appreciation of it was Filipino soldiers making their last stand in the pits. This moment struck me because of how hopeful it seemed in the midst of dark times; despite knowing that they were essentially walking into a suicide mission ([since the Americans had an insurmountable military advantage over them](https://www.thoughtco.com/philippine-american-war-4846100)), they wholeheartedly committed to it. This can be seen in their wearing of white uniforms that 
contrast with their dark surroundings, along with defending their territory with "great stubbornness", as the film's description states. This film has a depressing ending that reflects a depressing reality: we are still victims of imperialism, and our conquerors get to define history (this can be seen in how this film was produced by an American company, and [how so many Filipinos grow up glorifying the West](https://www.reddit.com/r/Filipino/comments/hvi5lc/why_do_filipino_worship_whitewestern_culture_so/)). I believe this film also shows "[Filipino resilience](https://www.scmp.com/yp/report/latest-reports/article/3123941/opinion-resilience-natural-characteristic-philippines-or)": how Filipinos can consantly pick themselves up in times of disaster.  I personally don't like how glorified this trait is because it exempts higher powers from taking  accountability (i.e. our government, imperialist countries), but I also see how many people can draw inspiration from it. If we were able to get through centuries of colonization, perhaps we can make it through the dismal future that lies ahead of us, like a looming recession and a oligarch-controlled government.

### Task 2
-   With the films in this module as pretext, think about how they relate to the concept of **imagination** (whether collective or individual).
-   Drawing from your background or experience, if you have any related or tangential insights, please feel free to share as well.


How do both of these films relate to the concept of imagination? Despite their differences, they're both about Filipinos fighting for a dream future — one where they are truly free. This is a future they have to imagine because they haven't experienced freedom in so long, thanks to decades of foreign powers taking over what they truly own. Even if they don't know what it's like to be free, they still know that it's their right. This is what motivates them to make their imagination a reality. 

Related to this insight, I realized recently that my dream future is collective liberation: a radical future that's free of oppressive systems, and everyone gets to be treated with dignity and respect. This got me way more interested in critical theory! I'm quite the polymath, so I'm motivated to work towards this future in various ways, whether it's as an educator or a technologist.
