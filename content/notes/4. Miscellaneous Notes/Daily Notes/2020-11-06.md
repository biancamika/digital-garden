## Nutrition
- 1100 for 5 days, 1800 for 2 days
- ==Calorie Cycling==
- Fasting isn't sustainable for me hahah
- message him daily!
- hit consistently calorie goals, but use smart choices
- struggle with consistency
- learning your limits, knowing when to back off
- if you know that you lack sleep, resched your training
- less than 0.75: waist/hip ratio
	- lower the better 
	- measuring body fat (indirectly)
- 0.42-0.45: waist/height ratio (aim for 0.45)
	- higher the better
	- measuring muscle mass (indirectly)
