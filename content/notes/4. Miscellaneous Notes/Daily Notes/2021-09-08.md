### Doughnut economics
#economics #sociology 
[**A healthy economy should be designed to thrive, not grow**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rhcrbcg8HBw)
+ reimagine the shape of progress
+ GDP became overriding goal of policymaking
+ How did this happen? **"The Stages of Economic Growth: A Non-Communist Manifesto"** by 1960 classic by W.W. Rostow
	+ All economies need to pass through 5 stages of growth:
		+ Traditional society, where a nation's output is limited by its technology, institutions and mindset
		+ Preconditions for takeoff
			+ beginnings of banking industry
			+ mechanization of work
			+ belief that growth is necessary for something beyond itself
				+ like national dignity or better life for children
		+ Takeoff
			+ compound interest is build into economy's intitutions
			+ growth becomes normal condition
		+ Drive to maturity
			+ you can have any industry you want, no matter your antural resource base
		+ The age of high-mass consumption
			+ people can buy all the consumer goods they want
+ This plane (mass consumerism) can never be allowed to land 
	+ financially, politically, socially addicted to growth
+ 21st century challenge: **to meet the needs of all people within the means of this planet**
	+ can't be measured with money
	+ we need a dashboard of indicators
		+ health 
		+ wellness
		+ social connectedness
		+ ecological regeneration
		+ fluid exchange of goods and services
+ Hole in the middle is where most people aer missing
+ new shape of progress: circle (not linear); very balanced
	+ this symbol of well-being is present in many cultures (e.g. Taoist Yin Yang, Buddhist endless knot)
+ centralized -> distributed
+ If we can harness today's technologies (from AI to blockchain) in the service of distributive design, we can ensure healthcare, education, finance, energy, political voice reaches and empowers people who need it the most.

Making cities sustainable involves exploring ways of satisfying human needs that reduce the acquisition of commodities. Using insights from this module (poverty, inequality, consumerism, the doughnut economics), describe in 3-5 paragraphs your sustainable development plan for the city/municipality you call your home (identify the place in your answer).

I've lived in Las Pinas my whole life, and I know it to be a very polluted and congested place. As an example, here are some of my memories: being afraid to cross the street during traffic, and holding my breath to avoid smelling car smoke and sidewalk litter. I acknowledge that I have a lot of privilege, which means that I can afford to have securing housing and ride private transportation. If going outside is already a terrible experience for me, how about those who have to take public transportation or sleep on the streets?

What would I do if I was responsible for my city's sustainable development plan? I would towards creating a greener city. Think more trees, trashcans, and improved public infrastructure (e.g. more pedestrian + biker sidewalks). This vision can be implemented by tackling topics like education, housing, and income + work. Even if these don't seem related, I believe they can contribute nonetheless.

First, education can be done by teaching citizens the knowledge they need to know (e.g. proper waste segregation). Then, building housing sites for informal settlers will not only improve their health, but also keep the streets safer and cleaner. Finally, jobs can be provided to those working towards a greener city (e.g. garbagemen, construction workers). Overall, doughnut economics made me realize how interconnected everything is.
