## Reboot Community Spotlight: Nikhil
**Framework:**
1. SENSING - info intake, active reading
2. REASONING - asking questions, applying knowledge, critical thinking
3. ACTING - learning by doing

You need to be situated, embodied, etc.

**Good pedagogy should help you:**
1. Give info
2. Help you think about it
3. Give opportunities to use it

**Content-format relationship matters**: in math you might read a book to learn theory, reasoning is thinking about it, then you apply it to a problem
