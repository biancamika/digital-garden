	- consultant: you don't often see things all the way through, but you can think at a more strategic level, working with high-level stakeholders
- most important: growth trajectory
- graduate degree: follow what you're interested in
	- electrical engineering -> engineering, psychology
	- nowadays, it's more specialized
- just cultivate your curiousities
- depends on what your undergraduate degree is
- why people go to graduate school
	- deepen knowledge
	- switch fields all together
- **design as a practice is a spiritual endeavor**

	- balance between design thinking (process) and making (hard skills)
	- how important is it to have coding skills? believes its importants
		- know how software is made in order to design
		- technical aspects, psychology, priniciples of design (e.g. aesthetics)
		- soft skills: e.g. collaboration, facilitation
	- design programs in the US are all over the place
		- better ones emphasize on critique, idea generation, executing ideas
		- some focused on the process, others focused on the technology, but at the expense of aesthetics

- in next sessions, talk about your struggles
- as a design student, cultivate what you consider as good design
- schools don't teach you taste
	- specific to culture, taste

## SocSci: Other development metrics
#sociology #economics 
### Capabilities Approach
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BunGwSCuksE
+ Economic freedom should be focused on developing the capabilities of people in developing countries
+ According to Amartya Sen
+ typical economics model aims to increase incomes, but doesn't serve the marginalized
+ personal freedom in all aspects of way is a great way to enhance economic development
+ **5 Human Freedoms**
	+ Political
	+ Economic
	+ Social
	+ Transparency Guarantees
	+ Protective Security
+ E.G. if someone can't read, they'll struggle to use their money wisely
+ increasing freedom > productivity
### Gross National Happiness
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Zqdqa4YNvI
+ GNH: every human being aspires for happiness
	+ country's development should also be measured in citizen happiness
+ how to balance GNH with economic development?
+ a flourishing economy gives the government the funds to provide their citizens with a working health and education system, along with higher living standards
+ people get a lot of positive energy from being with others and sharing their interests
	+ e.g. arts & culture, heritage, religion
### Social Exclusion Model
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eejmYz0O3YE
+ We can have core society, but also have processess that drag/suck people away into the fringes of society
	+ as we move away from the center, people experience a greater degree of social exclusion
	+ derailing them from actively participating in society, denied access to many resources
+ Example magnets
	+ Poverty
	+ Ill health
	+ Discrimination
		+ race, gender, sexual orientation, culture, citizenship, politics
	+ Education
	+ Housing
	+ Employment
+ People who experience social exclusion often have many magnets around
	+ not isolated
+ Consequences
	+ ill health
	+ crime
+ Factors
	+ Segregation: separating people, giving separate resources
		+ "separate but equal"; history shows that this is rarely true
	+ Social isolation: community may separate itself from the mainstream
		+ religious/cultural preferences

Which of the three metrics above resonate with you the most and why?

Out of these three development metrics, Gross National Happiness resonates with me the most. It shows that human fulfillment takes more than meeting the essentials like healthcare and education, but also sectors like arts and religion. These sectors aren't as useless as others think them to be (as a dancer myself). Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs supports this, showing needs like love + belonging, esteem, and self-actualization above physiological and safety needs.
