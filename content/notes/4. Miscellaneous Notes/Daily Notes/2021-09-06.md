#philosophy 
> "A good philosophy is like a good diet. A good diet requires good ingredients, good recipes, good balance ... We need a post-consumerist philosophy of new ingredients, new recipes..." — Jacob Lund Fisker

#life 
> "The cost of a thing is the amount of what I will call life which is required to be exchanged for it, immediately or in the long run." — Henry David Thoreau (Walden)

[[Everything has a cost]]

## Farnam Street

> Often what seems like an expensive solution is a cheap solution (in the long run) and what seems like a cheap solution is very expensive (in the long run).

[[Every purchase is a bargain]]

> **ideas as people:** “the theory of relativity gave birth to an enormous number of ideas”, “whose brainchild was that”, “those ideas died off in the middle ages”, “cognitive psychology is in its infancy“

Envrironments full of trash

> "The future of plastics is in the trash can"

Gap in covrage when it came to front end
Not as many people telling the story of WHERE it comes from
Who's making the plastics in the first place and why? -> Oil companies

Plastics were initially a waste product (e.g. tupperware)
For human betterment? (throwaway living)

Plastics industry embraces "buy more" after Great Depression
was initially hailed as biggest innovation due its durability

Impossible to manage in the first place
Waste lowers life expectancy

60-40 percentage of plstic caught (in PH fish)
40% plastic

91 % of plastic has never been recycled
Most plastic is VERY HARD to recycle
most litter, or are incernated, or go into landfills
2% is effectively recycled; the worse are downcycled

FMCGs tying to convince them that their packaging is environemtnally friendly
China dealing with all the trash
Recycling as the solution, that puts all the responsibiltiy on China
until the National Sword ban

Citizens not to blame, instead resposnibility should be on macroinstitutions like corporations
Other countries don't have the capacity to deal with the trash

Trash from all over the world

This is about **survival**
This is affecting our ecosystem, our community

Invention of sachets: sustainability shouldn't be the burden of those who can't afford to think about it (e.g. the poor)
Nick Joaquin: tingi culture is pro-poor

Billionares are complicit in this crisis
Poor health (e.g. defects) are consequences of the chemicals coming from pollution
