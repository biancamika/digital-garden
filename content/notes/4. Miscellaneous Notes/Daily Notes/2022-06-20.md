### Technological Determinism
What is technological determinism anyways?
> _"Technology will generate ==social change== based upon the ==implicit values, virtues, or vices== possessed by that technology. Culture and society =='react'== to technological developments in a ==cause-and-effect== manner."_

While, at first glace, it is easy to agree with this assessment, there are valid criticisms we need to be aware of to balance our appreciation of this theory. Factors such as ==intent, need, profit, and motivation== to change current existing life-conditions should be considered when applying this approach.

- Digital technologies (e.g. the internet, the web, mobile digital technologies) are more than just 'technologies', ==they're a set of social relations which incorporate the use of tehcnologies with various results==
- The question of intentionality
- New technologies are looked for....
	- To satisfy need/problem
	- Change life-conditions
	- Profit
- Both intended and unexpected outcomes


### Base, Superstructure, Infrastructure
- Digital technologies are a ==system of infrastructure==
- They contribute to the ==economic base== of society (the relations of production)...
- ...upon which the ==superstructure== (e.g. culture, institutions, roles, rituals, etc.) is built
- This infrastructural base provides a framework under which new forms of organization, relationships, and experiences (such as virtual cultures) can emerge
