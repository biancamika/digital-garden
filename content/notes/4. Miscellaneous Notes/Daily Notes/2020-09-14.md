#### Question
- What makes the modern butler modern and different from the butler of old? What concepts come to mind? 
- How about you, what does being modern mean to you?
- Looking at the infographic of the modern waiter and considering your own idea of what it is to be modern, what characteristics make our experiences, technology, values, practices, or other aspect of our life modern? Just type in what comes to mind when we talk about modernity.
#### Answer
In my perspective, being modern means adapting/being relevant with the times. For instance, this current era is shaped by technological innovation. Everything from the abstract (i.e. short attention span, and how it affects our desire for shorter content) to the concrete (i.e. clothing popularized by social media) is shaped by this influence.
