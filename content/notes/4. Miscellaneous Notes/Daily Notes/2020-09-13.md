![[Dan Mall Talk Goals.png]]
- How do you get others to use your design system?
- UNEXPECTED KINDNESS
- describe technical terms in kind words
	- Avoid inside baseball talk to generate buy in
- **The best way to grow your design system is to continue focusing on creating customer value**
- design system graveyard: attemps at design systems that no one uses
- how genuises make systems:
	- make products that customers love (pilots)
	- extract components to put in 
- score:
![[Design System Criteria.png]]
![[Design System Scoring.png]]
- roadmap can be subjective; scoring helps make this more objective
- The most exciting design systems are boring
	- frees designers and developers to do new stuff, solve new problems
- Beavers: ecosystem engineers
	- interested in building platforms on which people/things can stand
- E.G. HTTP -> World Wide Web
	- systems makes things easier to build
- The Hot Potato Process
	- design and devs work back and forth
	- how quickly you can make smth if u collaborate well 
- https://danmall.me/articles/hot-potato-process/
- LEGO ANALOGY FOR DESIGN SYSTEMS
- reference sites are like starting at the back of the store; how can we know that it's for us?
- "Design systems are for people"

4. digital confidence

### Sheryl Cababa -- Designing Backwards: Using Outcomes to Avoid Unintended Consequences
- negative externalities are not inevitaable
- we need to anticipate and respond to the ramifications of our work
- THREE PRICIPLES:
1. Tech is not neutral
	1. e.g. Facebook
	2. "Youtube, the Great Radicalizer"
	3. people stay on the platform longer if they're fed more extreme content
	4. By focusing on a single metric (engagement), we are shaping people's behavior in unintended ways
	5. "We limit how much tech our kids use at home"
		1. Silicon Valley Nannies are Phone Police for Kids
2. Know your values and stick to them
	1. "Show me your budget and I'll tell you what you value"
	2. "Challenge things with what you think is more essential." 
	3. "Use your values to drive your decision making."	
	4. Be brave with data
![[Sheryl Cababa Values.png]]
3. Design for outcomes and think beyond the direct benefits of use
	1. Understanding outcomes is understanding what happens is when your design is out in the world, beyond your control
	2. GOOD DESIGN FINDS A WAY

### Arvi Raquel-Santos
- “People management is just relationship-building”. 
- Find friendtors! Friends, peers = mentors
- Ask for **answers**, not mentors. Then create a relationship and an ongoing conversation with people, both more senior or on the same level. People are generally happy to help and give their time to helping those who want to learn. Mentorship is a two-way street: the person giving advice also learns from the process of teaching the other, so make sure you also give value back to them by taking them through your process/es and learnings and how their advice has or hasn't affected you.
- “Knowing when to leave is learning when you’re probably not growing anymore.”
