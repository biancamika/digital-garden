### Derek Fidler: The Future of Digital Equity is Mobile-Only
- Design in Tech report 2018
- us designers can easily overlook those without computers
- larger the better kasi
- Adjacent User Theory
- We limit power features to the desktop experience
- We need to design for those who aren't existing users
- HOW TO BUILD EMPATHY
	- Be the adjacent user
	- Watch the adjacent user
	- Talk to the adjacent user
- Apply this to mobile-only users
- Design for the users you want to have, not the users you have

### Rannie Teodoro: Dear UX
- Handwriting letters
	- improve learning abilities
	- foster postiive outlook and mood
	- thoughtful sensory experience
- Perfect portfolio -> practice iterating
- Perfect experience -> practice weaving a non-linear narrative
- We're a practice  -- not a perfection.
- Break it down to a chapter. To a page. to a paragraph. to a word. Set a tiny, accomplishable goal
- Don't wait to be invited
