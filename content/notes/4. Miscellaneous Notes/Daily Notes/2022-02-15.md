### TL;DR
- _What does it mean if I know the structures and or patterns of these stories and narratives? Are we just going to map out stories for their structures?_
+ The "storyness" that Science upholds, as a discipline is this: **_Rational thought, allied to scientific reasoning would lead inevitably toward moral, social, and ethical progress._**
	+ This is why the Philippines did not move an inch from this global catastrophe right now. The current administration refuses to abide by this grand narrative of Science and instead, chooses to go against it. Makes you wonder then if these government officials did not watch enough sci-fi movies to know that an utter disregard for science and human lives only leads to chaos.
+ The idea was also to use the structure of stories to **resolve or deal with the _binaries_ of lives.** 
	+ As much as we have peace, we have conflict. It's stories that tell us how these binaries can be addressed and understood. 
	+ The narrative structure that every story has also pointed us into the future, teaching us a way to live our lives, where we eventually discover who we are, what it is we need, what it is we have to do to fulfill that need, who will help us along the way, and where it is we have to go before we can truly find ourselves home again.
+ Thomas says these stories **"provide us with scripts that help us to navigate and make sense of experiences that we all share as human beings."** This idea was reinforced by one of my favorite philosophers, Joseph Campbell:
> _The idea, since forever, has been that story is a conveyance, a vehicle, to use in order to think, to move forward through life. At the end of a life that has meaning, the point is not that one is perfected, but that one will still carry a view of self and the world that is divine—and not just some kind of lazy drift. The point is to ==have enough stories that guide== —that will allow life's closing act to end with one's heart still bright, despite the gales that have passed through it —so that it can be said that one has lived with ==spiritual audacity._==
