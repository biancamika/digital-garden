### Pastoral Circle
- pastoral and social theology method to assist groups in recognizing, reflecting on, and responding to ==social injustices & injustices==
- roots in:
	-  the “see, judge, act” method of Cardinal Joseph Cardijn and the Catholic social tradition 
	-  the 'hermeneutic circle' of Juan Luis Segundo
	-  the methodology of modern Catholic Social Teaching
	-  the spirituality of St. Ignatius of Loyola. 
- Pay attention to what is expected of the following phases:
	- Experience of Poverty
		- poor persons/communities marginalized in our society
		- see Christ in them
	- Social Analysis
		- understand the situation of the poor
		- find the root causes
		- what causes poverty? what causes injustice?
	- Theological Reflection
		- analyze with the eyes of faith
		- hermeneutic circle
		- read a lot of bible
		- think critically
	- Pastoral Action
		- how can we enact change
		- authentic faith is one that has conviction

- integrate action and reflection

#### Human Experience as Starting Point of Theology
- theology is always contextual
- first step of pastoral circle = human experience
-  And to facilitate a closer look into the situations of people, we are challenged as Christians to undergo insertion or immersion particularly with those who are poor and marginalized in our society.  
-  Because of this, this first moment in the Pastoral Circle, is also called as ==insertion experience.==

1. Start with the data of human experience. In other words, “the ==lived experiences of individuals and communities== must be the foundation for all pastoral responses. What people are feeling, what they are undergoing, how they are responding, these are the experiences that constitute primary data.” 
2. Describe the problem. (What is the lived experience?/What is happening to people?)
3. Are we listening to the people most directly affected?
4. Can we / do we share their experience?  Do we need to undertake exposure / immersion?
