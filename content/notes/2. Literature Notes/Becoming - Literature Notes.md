## Notes
#literaturenotes 
See [[Becoming - Book]]
- [[Growth is a never-ending process]].
> Now I think it’s one of the most useless questions an adult can ask a child—What do you want to be when you grow up? As if growing up is finite. As if at some point you become something and that’s the end.

  > Becoming is never giving up on the idea that there’s more growing to be done.
- ==Don't settle for less.==
>There are simply other ways of being.


  >Do we settle for the world as it is, or do we work for the world as it should be?

- [[Grief and resilience live together]].
>But what America got that night was a moment of release, a chance to feel its own resilience.

- Transformation is both ==patience== and ==rigor.==
>Becoming requires equal parts patience and rigor. Becoming is never giving up on the idea that there’s more growing to be done.

- We are transformed through allowing both ==ourselves and others to be heard.==
>There’s power in allowing yourself to be known and heard, in owning your unique story, in using your authentic voice. And there’s grace in being willing to know and hear others. This, for me, is how we become.
