## Notes
+ **Transnational education:** arrangements/partnerships between institutions and organizations where students are located in a different country to the insititution
+ Not what I'm covering in [[Fast Food Education]], but could be similar since distance learning
+ Educational institutions are unable to respond to increased demand and technological developments. This is because of...
	+ Institutional barriers
	+ Slow adoption of new technologies
+ **Benefits of transnational education:**
	+ increase capacity to meet demand
	+ bring needed experience and professional development to disadvantaged countries
	+ help to expand a higher education system
	+ increase country's supply of highly skilled workers
	+ adds variety and choice to domestic systems
	+ ^ by introducing competition and potential for greater innovation
	+ enhance range, quality, etc. of domestic programs
	+ reduce "brain drain"
		+ students can still keep in contact with homelands and participate in capacity building
		+ students can still contribute to local knowledge economy
+ Similar to [[Fast Food Education]]:
	+ bringing knowledge and experience to disadvantaged countries
