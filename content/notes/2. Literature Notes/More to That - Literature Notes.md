### The Information Lifecycle: How Three Filters Shape the Mind
#information #cognition
- [[Attention is a zero-sum game]].
- Information abundance simply means we have infinite opportunities to react to data.
>Whenever we point to “information abundance,” what we are really saying is that we have ==“endless opportunities to react to data.”==
- The process of unknown facts becoming perspective-changing beliefs is known as the ==information lifecycle==.

- The first filter of this is ==awareness==.
	- This is governed by ==curiousity==. Without it, we remain closed to facts in the first place.
	> Without cultivating curiosity, the awareness filter remains closed to any facts in the first place.
	- There are ==shades== to this curiousity; we can go from having tunnel vision to being too open.
- The next filter is ==reactivity==.
	- This processes ==data as information==. 
		- Usable knowledge
	- One can adjust this filter through the strength of their ==cognitive capabilities==.
	- Instead of curiousity, processing information requires ==diligence==. 

> Whatever passes through becomes data, but in order for that to be processed as information, it must pass through the filter of reactivity.


> What allows one to adjust the filter of reactivity is the strength of their capabilities. Data becomes information only when you have the cognitive capacity to interpret it as such.

>  Interpreting information has less to do with curiosity, and more to do with ==diligence.== Curiosity was the force that brought me to the book, but diligence is what will make that book a useful source of [knowledge](https://moretothat.com/framework-for-knowledge/).
- The final filter is ==identity==.
	- This gives you the option to incorporate it into our worldview, composed of ==beliefs, ideas, and truths.==
	- [[Identity isn't constructed independently]]; it's always constructed in relationship to something else that exists alongside you.
	- Our identities bring together those who are ==similar,== but break apart those who are ==different.==

> Once that information is processed, we then have the option to incorporate it into our worldview, or discard it altogether. This is decided by the final bottleneck: ==the filter of identity.==


> Identity is the collection of beliefs, ideas, and truths you hold to position yourself within the world. No matter how independent you think you are, identity is ==always constructed in relationship to something else that exists alongside you.==

> Identities organize the familiar, but divide the unfamiliar. ==The more we love the idea of “us,” the more we hate the idea of “them.”==
- We can avoid this division among ourselves by ==freeing ourselves from the notion of identity.==
	- [[Freedom from conditioning]]: letting go of all of ==society's influences== that have forced us into certain roles (e.g. gender stereotypes)

> Krishnamurti calls this “freedom from conditioning,” where we are able to let go of all the societal influences that have shaped and categorized us into certain roles.


- If we rely less on our identities for processing information, we can ==learn more about the world and our place in it.==
	- We need to be curious in order to open our awareness to facts.
	- We need to update our capabilities in order to process data into information.
	- We need to let go of identity in order to build on our perspectives.

> The less we need to rely on our identities to make sense of information, ==the more we can learn about the world, and uncover our true place within it.==


> Without cultivating curiosity, the awareness filter remains closed to any facts in the first place.


> Without updating our capabilities, we can’t react to whatever data we discover.

> And without letting go of identity, no amount of information will ever shift our perspective.
