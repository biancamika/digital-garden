### Community is dead, long live community!
- ==People and conversations== are at the heart of any community. This is what people often don’t see, or all too easily forget.
- Of course, you also need that thing to ==bring people together. A vision. A purpose.== A thing that people get excited over.
- You can have community where there are people and conversations exist. ==You don’t need a specific community tool to make this happen.== A website. An email list. A Twitter following with a community mindset.
- The pressure of maintaining and running a community within a platform is big. It’s a ==never-ending wheel of content and maintenance.== Most people just aren’t up for the job, either from a founder’s perspective or even the pressure as a community member to participate.
- Then ==community fatigue== will set in. People will tire. Not necessarily because they don’t want or value the community, but more because everyone is talking about it. The blame is then put on community.
- In reality, people should be thinking about ==how to bake community in without feeling obliged to calling it community.== They should give access to conversations. Provide value. Help and lift people up. Build and design their products with their people in mind.
