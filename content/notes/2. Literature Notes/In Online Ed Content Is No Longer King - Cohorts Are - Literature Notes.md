## Notes

+ We are currently in a ==post-content age==. 
+ In the past, educational content was scarce. This was a USP of universities & accelerators. 
+ Now, content is cheap and abundant (i.e. Youtube, newsletters, blogs, social media).
	+ Tons of alternative education programs (e.g. accelerators, incubators, low-cost/free online courses) have also emerged.
+ Because of this abundance, it's been difficult for instructors to make a living from their expertise.
+ On the other hand, most learners are worse off for all this abundance, because ==[[More access does not translate to more engagement]]==.
+ Self-directed programs (i.e. workout programs, diet plans, online courses) rely on ==learners' willpower & motivation== to stick through a course. This doesn't always work out; in fact, MOOC completion rate is just 3 to 6 percent. [[Willpower and motivation is finite]]
+ Difference between cohort-based courses and MOOCs:
	+ engaging and real-time v.s. just self-paced
		+ fixed start and end date
	+ community-driven, active learning v.s. solo, passive consumption
		+ social contract = cohort

### MOOCs v.s. CBCs: The shift from content to communities
+ MOOCs may provide more access to creators and learners, but they don't help with ==student transformation.== 
	+ [[The goal of education is transformation]]
+ Why was this pledge naive?
	+ **MOOCs are asynchronous and self-paced**.
	+ **MOOCs’ low (or no) cost colors the perception of quality**.
	+ **MOOCs convey “knowledge transfer,” but not necessarily higher-order skills**.
		+ **[[Higher-order skills]]:** those that require analysis, evaluation, synthesis, judgement, and creativity
			+ [[Critical thinking and skill development are not mutually exclusive]]
		+ E.G. Learning how to use Excel v.s. learning how to segmnt data strategicially to look for patterns and arrive at a recommendation
+ Summary:
	+ Dominant learning modality for MOOC platforms: passive content consumption
		+ no interaction
		+ no real community
		+ no time constraint
	+ Result: tiny percentage of learners who follow through

### The case for cohort-based courses

#### CBCs focus on active, hands-on learning
+ While this format takes more effort + is more prone to mistakes, this allows students to learn more
+ Versus just listening to a lecture, no matter how much of a star the lecturer is

+ CBCs also bring the network beneits of startup accelerators to a wider market
+ The value in accelerators isn't just content; it's also ==community==

#### Live, bi-directional learning leads to more accountability
+ [_Cooperative Learning_](https://www.amazon.ca/Kagan-Cooperative-Learning-Grades-450pp/dp/1879097109) by Spencer Kagan:
	+ The single most powerful approach to comprehension and retention is [[Interactive processing]], which occurs when “students ==engage in interaction with partners or teammates== over the content".
	+ Why is this approach so powerful?
		+ Classroom discussions and debates produce new ideas and points of view
		+ This back-and-forth holds student attention in a way that no lecture can
+ Cohort-based courses have more accountability because they're bi-directional. This indicates:
	+ Exchange of knowledge between instructor and students
	+ Students with fellow students
	+ ==It's a dialogue, not a static lecture.== See [[The State Change Method]]

![[Pasted image 20210723015209.png]]

+ [[Interleaving learning]]: where instructors mix different topics, ideas, and activities together during study, forcing students to intentionally switch between them rather than focusing on a single subject
	+ This can result in better learning outcomes for students
	+ E.G. BJJ athletes alternates practice between chokes, locks, escapes, and take-downs
	+ CBCs are inherently about interleaving; they give students a chance to engage in diferent modalities — breakouts, role-playing, discussions, debates — with the instructor, coaches, and each other.

#### Community building improves learning outcomes through social features
+ Continuing education and adult learning must be ==compelling and carrot-driven==, not stick-driven
	+ versus traditional education, which forces students to learn
	+ CBCs design can also be inspired by institutions outside education, which are "sticky"
		+ E.G. military, dance-a-thons, Crossfit, cults
+ Why would people pay more for a CBC v.s. an MOOC?
+ CBCs self-select for learners who are willing to (and can) pay a premium for the ==perceived quality of content and follow-through.==
	+ Those who need accountability + urgency, which come from time constraints & a peer group

#### A new model for creator monetization
+ It's hard for instructors to monetize their expertise, especially if they don't have existing followings/networks
+ Traditional social platforms create a divison between ==activities for monetization and community building.==
	+ Because of this, most creators give away valuable content, but don't have enough volume to make a living from advertising alone
+ CBCs help creators monetize their expertise directly, and without requiring volume.
	+ Not just for classic educators, but also "knowledge" influencers

+ New quadrant of creator monetization:
	+ **Instructors can make a healthy amount of money**
	+ **Creators get more leverage with a productized offering**
	+ **Consumers get more payoff, creators get higher monetization potential and scalability**
