- Optimizing leisure activities is a ==display of the ego.==
> Optimizing creativity and play as another goal to conquer is also a ==manifestation of an ego== that desires to remain in control and “be the best at x”.
- [[The antidote to the ego is awareness]].
>as we become more wise, we’re able to remain in ==equilibrium== through non-attachment to these peaks and troughs.
- We can apply this to life through the [[Sweet Spot]] concept, made by Mr. Money Mustache.

> You can see this in mindfulness/creativity, sports like running, fame, careerbuilding, and more

> Doing an audit of your most extreme experiences, can help you calibrate towards your sweet spot.

-  [[The Golden Mean]] is a sliding scale for ==determining what is virtuous.== A virtue is a ==trait of character== that enables a person to ==flourish.== Aristotle believed that being morally good meant ==striking a balance between two vices.==
-   Awareness (the solution to ego) requires balancing one’s ==lifestyle, character and virtue.==
> Taking responsibility for our lives means that we are not only in the drivers seat in finding the “sweet spot” in many aspect of our lives (money, career, fame, health, etc.), but also in ==our character.==
