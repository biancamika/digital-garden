### Outsider Innovation
- [[Brand mood]] can simply be defined as a brand's essence, which is captured through both the ==abstract (e.g. values, beliefs) and the concrete (e.g. aesthetics, people)==
> Brand mood is its aesthetic universe, ideas, values, beliefs, music, the energy of people and places, the crowd it gathers and the crowd that gathers around it.
- [[Art is the opposite of hype]]. 
	- This is because at its core, it's a ==critique== of the surrounding industry and world
> Art is social and cultural critique, a constant questioning of what’s going on in the industry and in the world, exploring and preserving one’s independence while doing so. Putting something in a museum doesn’t make it art.
