- Don't be a speed reader; be a **speed understander**.
 > You can’t understand the world better simply by reading about it as much as possible. You do so by being intentional about what you pay attention to in the first place.
- To have better ideas, you have to get better at ==curating== them.
  >  What   if   the   secret   to   having   better   ideas   that   clients   loved   was   to   get   better   at   curating   them   be- fore I needed them?
- Non-obvious thinking starts from a ==growth mindset.==
  > Engaging in non-obvious thinking starts with adopting a growth mindset.
  
  > Seeing the non-obvious makes you more open minded to change and can help you disrupt instead of getting disrupted.
- The first non-obvious mindset is to be **observant**. Practice this by explaining the world to ==children==, watching processes in ==action==, and putting your ==devices== away.
  > Non-Obvious Mindset 1: Be Observant Pay attention to the world, and train yourself to notice the details that others miss.


   > Being observant isn’t simply about seeing the big things. It’s also about training yourself to pay attention to the little things.


   > EXPLAIN THE WORLD TO CHILDREN.
   > WATCH PROCESSES IN ACTION. LOCATION
   > PUT YOUR DEVICES AWAY. LOCATION.
- The second non-obvious mindset is be **curious**.  Practice this by consuming =="brainful media"== (e.g. TED talks, unusual lectures), reading ==unfamiliar== magazines, and asking ==questions== constantly.
    > Non-Obvious Mindset 2: Be Curious Ask questions, invest in learning, and approach unfamiliar situations with a sense of wonder.


    >  CONSUME “BRAINFUL MEDIA.”  READ UNFAMILIAR MAGAZINES. ASK QUESTIONS CONSTANTLY.
- Curiousity is a prerequisite to ==discovery.==
    > why curiosity matters: It’s a prerequisite to discovery.
- The "[[curse of knowledge]]" occurs when knowing more about a topic makes it ==more difficult to think outside the box.==
    >The more we know about a topic, for example, the more difficult it becomes to think outside our expertise and broaden our view. Psychologists describe this phenomenon as the “curse of knowledge.” 
- The third non-obvious mindset is to be **fickle**.  Practice this by saving your ideas ==offline==, setting yourself at a ==time limit==, and taking ==shorter== notes.
    > Non-Obvious Mindset 3: Be Fickle Save interesting ideas for later consumption without overanalyzing them in the moment. 


    > SAVE IDEAS OFFLINE. SET YOURSELF A TIME LIMIT. TAKE SHORTER NOTES.
- When you brainstorm, don't dwell on individual ideas. Ideating and analyzing ==needs time to be effective.==
    > Any experienced facilitator or creative coach will tell you that the best way to kill the flow of a brainstorming session is to dwell on individual ideas. Ideation and analysis need a buffer of time between them for either to be effective.
- Being fickle is about ==freeing yourself from the pressure to recognize connections immediately;== this makes it easier to analyze ideas later.
    > Being fickle isn’t about abandoning ideas too quickly or being unable to focus. It’s about freeing yourself from the pressure to recognize connections among ideas immediately and making it easier to return to a collec- tion of ideas to analyze them later. 
- The fourth non-obvious mindset is to be **thoughtful**. Practice this by ==waiting== for a moment, ==writing and rewriting==, and embracing ==pauses.==
    >Non-Obvious Mindset 4: Be Thoughtful Take time to develop a meaningful point of view, and consider alternative viewpoints.
    
	> WAIT A MOMENT. WRITE.   THEN   REWRITE.  EMBRACE THE PAUSES.
- The fifth non-obvious mindset is to be **elegant**. Practice this by keeping it ==short==, using ==poetic== language, and breaking it into ==pieces.==
- A **trend** is a ==curated observation== of the ==accelerating present.==
   > if you want to get better at antici- pating the future, start by getting better at understanding the present.
   
   > A   trend   is   a   curated observation of the accelerating present.
- **Trends** typically describe human behaviors and beliefs that develop ==over time,== while **fads** describe things that are briefly popular but don't last. 
   > Although some trends may seem to spotlight a currently popular story or cultural event, they typically describe behaviors and beliefs that develop over time. Fads describe something that’s briefly popular but doesn’t last. Great trends reflect a mo- ment in time, but that moment is never fleeting, and the basic idea is more elevated. Good trends always focus on the shift in an underlying human behavior or belief. They don’t describe a sin- gle interesting story or a hot new product or industry. LOCATION: Page 46
- **Trend spotting** is simply collecting interesting ideas without understanding their meaning in a broader context.
    > Trend spotting isn’t the same as identifying actual trends. When you focus on spotting stories that stand out, you   gravitate   toward   collecting   interesting   ideas   without   understanding   the   broader   context   of   what   they   mean.
