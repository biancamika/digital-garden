## Notes
**"[[The cult of speed]]"**
+ coined by journalist Carl Honore
+ Fast and slow are shorthand for ==ways of being, or philosophies of life==
	+ Fast: busy, controlling, aggressive, hurried, analytical, stressed, superficial, impatient, active, quantity-over-quality
	+ Slow: calm, careful, receptive, still, intuitive, unhurried, patient, reflective, quality-over-quantity. It is about ==making real and meaningful connections with people== — culture, work, food, everything.

**[[McDonaldization]]**
+ coined by George Ritzer
+ also known as "need for speed"
+ the process by which the ==principles of the fast food industry are coming to dominate== more and more sectors of the world
+ Four characteristics of this worldview:
	+ Efficiency
	+ Predictability
	+ Calculability (quantifiable results)
	+ Control (or at least the illusion of it)

**McDonaldization of Education**
+ attempts to wipe out ==messiness/inefficiencies== of learning
	+ adapting shortcuts
+ reduces education into a ==commodity== that can be packaged, marketed, and sold
+ reduces learning to an ==assembly line==
	+ things are homogenized as much as possible
+ reality: imposing a ==mechanistic view of life== on an ==organic process== (learning) at a great cost
+ Efficiency
	+ responsible for these ideas:
		+ teachers can be replaced by Khan Academy
		+ drastic student to teacher ratios
	+ assumes that transition of information is the most important part of learning
	+ What about...
		+ developing children into thoughtful, ethical citizens who critically evaluate, rather than being swayed?
		+ creating citizens instead of consumers
	+ When learning is treated as one more product to be consumed, ==a horrible disconnect== occurs in our students.
		+ It becomes about the mark.
		+ It becomes about the diploma.
		+ It becomes about the end justifying a lot of terrible means.
+ Predictability
	+ causes the ==standardization of a curriculum and the way it's taught==
		+ with little to no regard for student interest, background, or ethnicity
		+ [[Digital learning exacerbates and reproduces inequality]]
	+ Every student must be able to display the same skill (or regurgitation of content knowledge) at the same time.
+ Calculability
	+ Important to calculate whether there's a difference being made or not, so ==system of high stakes testing== is introduced
	+ Just ends up stressing out and disengaging students more
+ Control
	+ Fear of...
		+ losing one's job
		+ losing funding
		+ having embarassing test results published
		+ having your child not being able to...
			+ get into college
			+ get a "good" job
	+ No idea of long-term cost
	+ Effects (Short-term)
		+ Lose a lot of new teachers in first five years
			+ Others quit early or need stress leave
		+ Children are more heavily medicated now than any other time in history

**[[The Slow movement]]**
+ originated from Slow Food
	+ abdicates industrial food conglomerates
	+ seeks to reconnect citizens to the richness of a common life with the neighbours who grow and prepare our food
+ The Slow movement is...
	+ a call for intentionality
	+ an awareness of our mutual interdependence with all people and all creation
	+ seeking to root people in their community
+ Not about having everything done as slow as possible, but rather seeking to do things well and at the right speed
+ Principles
	+ Good
	+ Clean
	+ Fair

**[[The Slow movement]] for education**
+ What it's all about...
	+ Reimagining what it means to be a community of learners
	+ Requires us to admit to and evaluate the organic messiness of learning
	+ Requires admitting that a large part of what is happening isn’t good for our children, our teachers, or our communities
	+ Rather than a top down industrialized and homogenized assembly line of education, we need a ==grass roots development of education that takes into account what real learning looks like and what children really need.==
+ Principles
	+ Authentic
		+ Not based on worksheets, standardized tedts, etc.
		+ Allows children to engage in real, meaningful work that matters to them and their community
		+ Empowes children with the opportunity to identify and seek solutions to problems in their community
		+ Consequence of these changes: re-educating communities to see students as authentic and active participants in community life
		+ Authentic education is also an ==act of justice==. [[Design justice]]
			+ allowing kids to explore social issues
			+ helping them become ethical citizens who speak out and make a difference
	+ Individualized
		+ No more ==homogeneity==
		+ Respond to ==real needs== of students
		+ Shift to using content to teach skills, student interest, and how to learn
		+ Student-centered
		+ Teachers must become co-learners, and let go of control. [[Teachers are facilitators]]
		+ Requires ==trust==: districts to trust administrators, administrators to trust teachers, and teachers to trust students.
		+ Supporting all of this is a community deeply connected to the life of the school
	+ Formative
		+ Marks (arbitrary symbols) -> summative assessments should be abolished
		+ No one really understands what grades mean
		+ The reason we don’t do what we know is best for our children because we don’t have the guts or because it’s too much work
		+ ==Formative assessment== allows kids to...
			+ Reflect on their learning
			+ Figure out how to create better
			+ Allows for more failure and less judgement
			+ Provides feedback and voice

> So what is the bottom-line of the slow education movement?
✓ We ==abolish== the busy, controlling, aggressive, hurried, analytical, stressed, superficial, impatient, quantity-over-quality ==education environment== that prevails today.
✓ We educate parents and communities about the ==risks of today’s current model==, including the drawbacks of “edubusiness.”
✓ We ==create learning environments== that are carefully crafted, receptive, still, intuitive, unhurried, patient, reflective, quality-over-quantity and engaging.
✓ We develop curriculum that has ==greater depth than breadth.==
✓ We make sure our curriculum takes into account ==local culture== and celebrates the uniqueness of our ==local community.==
✓ We don’t isolate skills development but ==let students grow their skills== as they engage with important content. [[Critical thinking and skill development are not mutually exclusive]]
✓ We construct learning environments that ==foster questioning, creativity and innovation==, such as the maker movement and project/problem based learning. [[Problem-based learning]]
✓ We find the courage to have serious discussions about ==abolishing standardized testing, classroom marks and grading, and the use of “birth year” as our primary criterion for sorting students.==
✓ We ==lobby our governments for funds== to assure true equality in education for all children.
✓ We ==discontinue the ranking== of teachers and schools.
✓ We ==replace our egg-carton grades with flexible, personalized learning== that takes into account when students are ready to engage in and acquire important skills.
✓ We ==make time for teacher collaboration== a top priority.
✓ We expect all classrooms to ==connect students globally== so they can learn from others around the world and apply what they learn in their own communities through meaningful projects and service.
✓ We ==make student voice and choice an integral part== of everyday teaching and learning.
