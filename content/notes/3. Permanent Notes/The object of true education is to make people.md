## Notes
> “I insist that the object of all true education is not to make people carpenters, it is to make carpenters people.
—W. E. B. Du Bois, The Talented Tenth”

> “Is the ultimate object to make people good coders, or to make coders good people?”

+ Are we satisfied with everyone learning to code if the end game is to produce coders who will primarily work to ensure the continued profitability of capitalist start-ups and tehcnology giants?
+ what if we advocate that people learn to code in ways that also push them to think more critically about software, technology and design and tha tprepare them to help reshape technology in the service of human liberationj and ecologial sustianability, rather than the matrix of domination?
