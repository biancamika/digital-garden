## Notes
-  It's always constructed in relationship to something else that exists alongside you.
-  Our identities bring together those who are ==similar,== but break apart those who are ==different.==


> Identity is the collection of beliefs, ideas, and truths you hold to position yourself within the world. No matter how independent you think you are, identity is ==always constructed in relationship to something else that exists alongside you.==

> Identities organize the familiar, but divide the unfamiliar. ==The more we love the idea of “us,” the more we hate the idea of “them.”==
