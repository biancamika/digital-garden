## Notes
- Marketing can be a form of generosity
	- >Marketing acts (interesting choice of word, acts) are the generous actions of people who care.
- >Marketers donâ€™t make average stuff for average people. Marketers make change. And they do it by normalizing new behaviors.
- >Lazy marketers try to buy enrollment with flashy ads. The best marketers earn enrollment by seeking people who want the change being offered. And they do it by connecting people to others who want the change as well. And that change is precisely what marketers seek.
