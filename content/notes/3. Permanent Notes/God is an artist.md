## Notes
   > God is a lavish, opulent,   extravagant   artist ,   and   creation   is   his   beauty   on   display.


   > As people made in his image — all work is artistic. All work is inherently creative. All work — from painting to parenting — is reshaping the raw materials of Planet Earth in such a way that it’s how God intended, how it’s supposed to be, all so humans can thrive as they see God’s glory.

- God's glory is about ==presence and beauty.==
  >  The   idea   behind   kavod   is   God’s   significance .   He’s   weighty,   as   in   important .   There’s   something   about   this God that we need to stand in awe of. And all through the Scriptures, God’s glory is about two things: Presence and beauty.
   
   > God’s   kavod   here   isn’t   his   fame;   it’s   his   presence   —   the   fact   that   he   was   there ,   not   far   away,   but   close.   Heav- en and earth were wed, if only for a moment. And it’s his beauty — this staggering sense of how good he really is.

- ==We are God's partners in creation.==
   >  As   people   made   in   God’s   image,   we   can   join   him   in   this   ongoing   creative   work.   As   his   partners,   we   can   re- shape   the   raw   materials   of   his   world   in   such   a   way   that   people   see   the   beauty   behind   the   beauty. 


    >  “Good design is putting our best forward; it is working hard to bring beauty into the world. When I see something that is brilliant it wrecks me in the best sort of way. I am also constantly returning to this idea that we were created with the ability to create and that makes our God the most generous of all. I’m humbled after I complete every new project, and as I stand there with a big silly grin on my face, I feel his presence and approval.”
