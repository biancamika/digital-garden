### How to deliver engaging live lectures on Zoom

+ **Monotony causes audiences to tune out. Movement causes audiences to become alert.**
+ **State Change Method:** _Aim for a state change every 3–5 minutes to break up the monotony of a monologue-style lecture. A state change is anything that punctuates an instructor’s monologue and offers a change in pace that causes students to perk up and snap back to attention._
+ State changes include:
	-   breakout rooms
	-   asking students to comment in the chat box
	-   switching from screen share back to gallery view mode, vice versa
	-   asking students to unmute to chime in
	-   literally having anyone else talk
	-   putting a question on the screen to ask students to reflect silently
	-   cracking a joke and adding humor
	-   giving the mic to other students to share
	-   asking students to pause to internalize what was said
	-   Q&A
	-   group discussions
+ built around modern audiences that are ==even more naturally restless==--and instead of blaming people for not being able to sit still, the ==responsibility is on the instructor== (that’s you) to make the lectures exciting enough to want to stay awake for.

#### **You are 50% instructor, 50% entertainer**
+ Goal as instructor: student transformation. 
+ If you’re 90% instructor and 10% entertainer, you’re a college professor.
+ If you’re 10% instructor and 90% entertainer, you’re a human incarnation of a BuzzFeed video.
 
**A conversation versus a performance**
+ You don’t “lecture” to a group of 5 people. You have a conversation with them.
+ When you’re in a small group, the dynamics are different because the tone is conversational.
+ On the other hand, lecturing to a room of 100+ people in Zoom is a different story. The instructor can’t personally jump in to save the conversation anymore. This is why I recommend instructors ==practice teaching to a large enough audience where they can’t just rely on personalized attention to individual students to carry the day.==

+ When you lecture for a larger group, the dynamics switch from a conversation to more of a performance. You still want to be conversational, but now you are ==performing for a group.==

#### Just say no to monologues

**1. Vary your pace/style: Fast and slow, loud and quiet.**

**2. Fight the urge to tell. Embrace the [[Socratic method]] and ask instead.**

**3. Add interactivity. And then add some more.**
