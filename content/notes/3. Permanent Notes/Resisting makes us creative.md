## Notes
- **By making us more attentive.**
	- Attentiveness that does not assume that there is something 'new' to be seen
	- Instead, it's deeply attuned to what we were too distracted to notice in the first place
- **By making us more open.**
	- True openness rejects the feeling that we as individuals, with our own abilities, are enough
	- It rejects the belief that observations alone in any moment are finished
	- It rejects the eagerness to dispose the ideas the reveal themselves to us
- **By making us less about the "next big thing".**
	- It encourages us to do the same things all over again, but that's okay
	- Creativity = revising, recooping, regenerating
- **By making us protective of time and space.**
	- Resisting the ways the world can distract us and clutter our mind
	- Add to Cathexis 5
- **By making us more receptive.**
	- Culturally, we're trained to analyze and judge too quickly, way too often. Resist against this!
- **By allowing us to participate in collective imagination and collaboration.**
	- NOT machinations of individual genius
	- NOT acting like self-sufficient lone wolves
- **By encouraging us to view everyone —ourselves included— as diffabled.**
- **By encouraging us to do more of nothing.**
	- More waiting > always looking for
