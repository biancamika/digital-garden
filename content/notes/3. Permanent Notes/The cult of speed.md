## Notes
+ coined by journalist Carl Honore
+ Fast and slow are shorthand for ==ways of being, or philosophies of life==
	+ Fast: busy, controlling, aggressive, hurried, analytical, stressed, superficial, impatient, active, quantity-over-quality
	+ Slow: calm, careful, receptive, still, intuitive, unhurried, patient, reflective, quality-over-quantity. It is about ==making real and meaningful connections with people== â€” culture, work, food, everything.
