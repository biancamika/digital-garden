## Notes
- **Meaning:** To save the lover's body
- When you see with your eyes, but you experience it emotionally -- feeling at one with it -- at the same time 
- E.G. The feeling astronauts get looking at Earth from afar in space, seeing it as fragile and precious
	- Makes all our petty struggles irrelevant
- We should bring purpose into our every action; how am I serving others with what I do?
