## Notes
- Marketing concept from Seth Godin
	- >The book presents Godin's personal belief that creative advertising is less effective today because of clutter and advertising avoidance.
- **Definition:** companies must build things ==worth noticing== right into their products or services
- > It’s almost impossible to spread your word directly. Too expensive, too slow. To find individuals, interrupt them, and enroll them, one by one . . . it’s a daunting task. The alternative is to intentionally create a product or service that people decide is worth talking about. I call this a Purple Cow.
- Addition to the ==traditional 5 P's of marketing:== product, price, place, promotion, and people
