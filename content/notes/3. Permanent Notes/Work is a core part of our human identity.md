## Notes
>  Because when we stop working, we lose a part of who we are. 

  > In   Genesis ’s   vision   of   humanness,   we   don’t   work   to   live;   we   live   to   work .   It   flat   out   says   we   were   created   to rule — to make something of God’s world. 
 
  >  your   work   is   a   core   part   of   your   humanness.   You   are   made   in   the   image   of   a   work- ing   God.   God   is   king   over   the   world,   and   you’re   a   king,   a   queen   —   royalty   —   ruling   on   his   behalf.   Gathering   up the creation’s praise and somehow pushing it back to God himself.
