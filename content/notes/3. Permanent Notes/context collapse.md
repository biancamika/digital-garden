## Notes
- **Context collapse** is the standardization of all events to fit in one generic timeline. Other definitions: ==flattening== multiple audiences into a single context, or multiple audiences revolve around singular communicative acts....etc. Basically lack of perspective. See Julie Zhou's Looking Glass.

> the ==standardization== of all events, no matter how big or small, delightful or traumatic, to fit the same mashed-together timeline.
