## Notes
- >The purpose of our culture isn’t to enable capitalism, even capitalism that pays your bills. The purpose of capitalism is to build our culture.
- To change a huge culture, start first with a ==small group.==
	- >In order to change a culture, we begin with an exclusive cohort. That’s where we can offer the most tension and create the most useful connections.
- A marketing asset (i.e. a brand) is made up of ==connection== and ==everything non-quantifiable.==
	- > If you want to build a marketing asset, you need to invest in connection and other nontransferable properties. If people care, you’ve got a brand.
- ==Direct marketing== is measurable and oriented towards action, while ==brand marketing== is unmeasurable and oriented towards culture.
	- >Direct marketing is action oriented. And it is measured. Brand marketing is culturally oriented. And it can’t be measured.
