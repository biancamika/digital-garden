## Notes
> My point is that as human beings, we have this slant to look to our work for significance we can only find in God. When we uncouple our work from God, work becomes a sort of god in and of itself.


   > Because the curse drives us to God. If it weren’t for the curses — on both the family and the field — we would look to whatever it is we do for work   or   rest,   and   we   would   find   it .   And   nothing   could   be   more   disastrous   for   the   world   than   God’s   image   bear- ers finding identity and belonging and even satisfaction apart from him.
