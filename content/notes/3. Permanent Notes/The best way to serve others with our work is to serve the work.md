## Notes
> A genuine, authentic love of excellence isn’t rooted in greed or narcissism or materialism — that’s dualism talking.   It’s   rooted   in   love ,   for   God   and   others.   A   desire   to   serve   God   and   his   world   well. 
    

> Dorothy Sayers, this spunky, rebellious British writer from half a century ago, said that the best way to serve others with our work is to “serve the work.”
    
> Do one thing. And   do   one   thing   well . And do that one thing well as an act of service and love for the world and to the glory of God.
    
> If you’re really good at whatever it is you do, you don’t need to tell the rest of us. We’ll know. Beautiful things don’t ask for attention.

- Summary: excellence is enough to serve others
