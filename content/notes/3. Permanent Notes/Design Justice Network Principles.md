## Notes
1. “We Use Design to Sustain, Heal, and Empower Our Communities, as Well as to Seek Liberation from Exploitative and Oppressive Systems”
2. “We Center the Voices of Those Who Are Directly Impacted by the Outcomes of the Design Process”
3. “We Prioritize Design’s Impact on the Community Over the Intentions of the Designer”
4. “We View Change as Emergent from an Accountable, Accessible, and Collaborative Process, Rather than as a Point at the End of a Process”
5. “We See the Role of the Designer as a Facilitator Rather than an Expert”
6. “We Believe that Everyone Is an Expert Based on Their Own Lived Experience and that We All Have Unique and Brilliant Contributions to Bring to a Design Process”
7. “We Share Design Knowledge and Tools with Our Communities”
8. “We Work toward Sustainable, Community-Led, and Controlled Outcomes”
9. “We Work toward Nonexploitative Solutions that Reconnect Us to the Earth and to Each Other”
