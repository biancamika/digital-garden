## Notes
-   Awareness (the solution to ego) requires balancing one’s ==lifestyle, character and virtue.==
> Taking responsibility for our lives means that we are not only in the drivers seat in finding the “sweet spot” in many aspect of our lives (money, career, fame, health, etc.), but also in ==our character.==
