## Notes
>A new language enables us to make the transition from where we are now, to where we need to get to. It lets us leap disciplinary boundaries. If we canâ€™t describe it, then we struggle to make it.
- How can you go somewhere new if you can't even describe what it is? Language is our map.
- Language is important because of its ==ability to shape the way we see and act in the world.==
