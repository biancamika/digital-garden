### What is popular education?
#### Key Principles
1. **Education is never neutral:** “it either maintains the current system of domination, or it is designed to liberate people;""
2. **Relevance:** “Pop Ed engages with issues that people care deeply about;”
3. **Problem-posing:** “all participants have the capacity to think, question, and act, and Pop Ed is about identifying the root causes of problems that people want to change;”
4. **Dialogue:** “no one knows everything, but together we know a lot, if we listen to each other;”
5. **Praxis:** “real learning takes places through the cycle of reflection and action to transform the world;”
6. **Transformation:** “Pop Ed is about engaging communities to transform individuals, communities, the environment, and the broader society.10”
