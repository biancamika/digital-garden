### What is Critical Pedagogy?
From [HOW TO IMPLEMENT CRITICAL PEDAGOGY INTO YOUR CLASSROOM](https://www.theedadvocate.org/how-to-implement-critical-pedagogy-into-your-classroom/#:~:text=Critical%20pedagogy%20is%20a%20teaching,structures%20of%20power%20and%20oppression.&text=In%20critical%20pedagogy%2C%20a%20teacher,families%2C%20schools%2C%20and%20societies.):
> Critical pedagogy is **a teaching philosophy that invites educators to encourage students to critique structures of power and oppression**

From the Design Justice Book:
+ It seeks to ==transform consciousness==, to provide students with ways of knowing that enable them to know themselves better and live in the world more fully.
+ The ==role of the educator== here is to pose problems, create spaces for the collective development of critical consciousness, help to develop plans for action to make the world a better place, and develop a sense of agency among learners.
+ **Critical community technology pedagogy:** an approach that “demystifies systemic power inequalities, involves a multi-directional learning process, results in transferable skills, and constructs a new world as it constructs knowledge.”
