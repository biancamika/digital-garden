## Notes
- >The alternative is to build your own quadrant. To find two axes that have been overlooked. To build a story, a true story, that keeps your promise, that puts you in a position where you are the clear and obvious choice.
- >The alternative is to find and build and earn your story, the arc of the change you seek to produce.
