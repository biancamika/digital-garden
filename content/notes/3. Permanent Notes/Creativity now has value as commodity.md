## Notes
- **Core Critique:** ==creativity has become an individual characteristic that can be traded. [[Creativity now has value as commodity]]==
	- Culture + creative industries are impacted by capitalism's appropriation of creativity for the sake of growth + progress
	- Irony & Crisis: Capitalism-enabled creativity represents & actualizes power, but are just:
		- continuations of a knowledge used towards profit
		- agency towards sales
		- desires to tickle our same individual fancies as consumers
	- But in the end, who gains from all this?
