    - 2. What did astronaut Edgar Mitchell have to say about beauty?

    - 3. The most beautiful question in the world
- the question of beauty takes us away from the surfaces to thinking about the core foundations of things.
    - 4. The roots of design
- all useful things should also be beautiful. God, as architect Mies van der Rohe said, was in the details and, you never know, an angel may come one day and sit on that chair – it had to be worthy of such an event.
    - 5. The enduring utility, honesty and beauty in Shaker design
- if you cannot describe a new destination, you will never get there.
    - 6. What world was Doug Engelbart trying to create?
- the limits of our language are the limits of our world. A new language enables us to make the transition from where we are now, to where we need to get to. It lets us leap disciplinary boundaries. If we can’t describe it, then we struggle to make it.

- ‘The greatest enemy of creative success is the attempt to fortify against failure.’

- Why does art endure? Because it always one way or another speaks directly to our senses.

- January 30, 2020
- 17. The master of materials

- Fourteen Practices to Create Enduring Beauty

- Fourteen Practices to Create Enduring Beauty
- Openness is a design tool offering new organisational, social and commercial capability. Openness is cultural – being open to new ideas. Openness is mutual – the sharing and redistribution of knowledge, information, data resources and wealth.

- 20. Time is earthed
- Some things can take the time they need. Not the time you think they need. Time, like the hedge, is earthed.

- 21. Love the work you do: Blitz Motorcycles
- Investing in loving what you do always costs time, money, and sometimes the odd scar and bruise. It repays that love with personal satisfaction, and in turn it inspires, guides and nurtures the spirit in others.

- Allowing people to arrive at their own conclusions of what needs to be done, and embracing what they create, is another form of wise leadership.

- Appendix I:
- Branby calls his worldview and philosophy ‘The Total’, as it encompasses ethics, business, production process, products and the world we inhabit. For him, ‘What we take, what we make and what we waste’ are in fact all questions of ethics. We have, he says, an unlimited responsibility for ‘The Total’, a responsibility that we try but do not always succeed in taking. One part of that responsibility is the quality of the product and how many years it will endure. Rather than designing in obsolescence, Branby designs it out.

- Appendix I:
- Meaning is created through a craft approach to life. And in many ways it is a gift that we give to ourselves and to others. So craftsmanship does not only exist in the manufacture of ancient tools; it exists, or should exist, in all that we do.
