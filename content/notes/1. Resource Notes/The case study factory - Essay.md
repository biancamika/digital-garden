## Highlights
Bootcamps skip on foundational disciplines due to lack of time.
> Because these bootcamps are by definition short programs, they tend to focus exclusively on the ==practical skills and methods== that a UX designer needs to find their first job. This means that such courses tend to skip what might be considered the ==foundational disciplines of digital design==, such as anthropology, philosophy, art history, and graphic design.

Short programs like bootcamps are output-focused.
> Instead, these shorter programs are designed with one key output in mind: the UX/UI case study.

Time-to-job is the most important KPI for short programs.
> Short design courses and bootcamps promise to place students in the industry as quickly as possible — making ==time-to-job the most important KPI== these programs are designed to meet.

Because of this KPI, schools have to standardize their curricula. This is reflected in the structured templates of their students' case studies.
> The myopic focus on shorter time-to-job metrics requires schools to ==standardize their design curricula== — a trend which is reflected in the ==structure of case studies== being produced.

> Most schools provide students with a template for their case studies

This standardization makes it difficult for students to diffrentiate themselves (i.e. unique thinking, skills, point of view)
> The similarities across case studies make it really hard for designers to demonstrate their unique thinking, skills, and point of view. How can you differentiate yourself when applying to a position, if case studies from other candidates look exactly the same at first glance?

[[Critical thinking and skill development are not mutually exclusive]]
> Is this formulaic approach to the design process endangering young professionals’ capacity for critical thinking?
