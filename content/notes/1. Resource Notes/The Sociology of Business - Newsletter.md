## Highlights
### Outsider Innovation
- ==Brand mood== is its aesthetic universe, ideas, values, beliefs, music, the energy of people and places, the crowd it gathers and the crowd that gathers around it.
- ==Art is the opposite of hype.== Art is social and cultural critique, a constant questioning of what’s going on in the industry and in the world, exploring and preserving one’s independence while doing so. Putting something in a museum doesn’t make it art.
