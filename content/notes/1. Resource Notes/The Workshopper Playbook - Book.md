## Highlights
**Recurring Problems:**
1. Teams didn't know how to best start projects
2. No clear, unified system in place for the actual running of a project
3. Poor communication during the prohect stifled creativity and progress

**Root Cause:**

> we (me, my clients, my previous employer, and virtually every company I’d ever come into contact with) ==didn’t have a recipe== for starting projects, structuring discussions, and committing to a plan of action to get meaningful work done.


> no systems for making big decisions, no systems for getting people to collaborate in a way that doesn’t make everyone want to kill each other

### Section 1: Becoming a Workshopper
> Without a facilitator, the Design Sprint is like an orchestra without a conductor, like a recipe for a complicated meal, without a chef to cook it.


> The facilitator’s role in a Design Sprint is to be the ==guide== – to be the person to run teams through the exercises in the Design Sprint, and take all the weight of the small decisions off their shoulders.

> the singular goal of a Workshopper is to ==unlock people’s superpowers==

#### The Essential Workshop Principles
1. "Together, alone"
2. Everything is anonymous
3. Creativity is nice to have but it is not essential

#### The 4 Steps to Becoming a Workshopper
1. Mindset and theory
2. Facilitation skills
3. The Toolkit
4. Battle-tested workshop recipes

#### Section 2: The Perfect Workshop Framework
##### The 4C's Framework
1. **Collect:** The Collect phase is where the ==scope of work for a project or challenge is defined.==
2. **Choose:** The Choose phase of the workshop ==gives clear direction== and ==acts as a foundation== for everything else.
3. **Create:** it’s time for team members to create solutions. Solutions don’t need to be final, or even well thought-out – at this point it’s more about ==creating multiple potential solutions.==
4. **Commit:** the Workshopper helps participants to ==commit to a small number of solutions== that will be executed on and discard/de-prioritize others, while also helping the team ==define the next steps==

###### Key Terminology
- **Workshop:** A combination of exercises that work together within a framework
- **Exercise:** An individual exercise that can be combined with others to make a workshop

###### Collect
> The goal of the Collect phase is to ==collect challenges and data from a team==, then ==visualize== it in a way that’s easy for everyone to ==understand.==

###### Choose
> To help a team choose what to work on, what to focus on and what to ignore for now.


> While the Collect phase is about quantity and volume, the Choose phase is about narrowing down and refining, so no new ideas or concepts should be generated or introduced here.

###### Create
> workshops democratize the creative space


> The goal of the Create phase of a workshop is to generate lots of solutions to the prioritized problem.

> By the end of the Create phase you want to have a handful of prioritized solutions to take into the next phase: the Commit phase.

##### Commit
> “[[Ideas are just a multiplier of execution]] . . . Ideas are worth nothing unless they’re executed.” 
> -- *Anything You Want*, Derek Sivers


> Companies don’t have a problem coming up with good ideas, no, companies have plenty of ideas! ==The problem is that they can’t choose which ones to commit to and execute and which ones to ignore.== They don’t have systems for commiting to ideas and really seeing them through, they often try to do every idea at once and never do any of them well.


> The goal of the Commit phase is to take our prioritized solutions and create a plan of action for actually making it happen.

###### Workshop Preparation
+ **Warm up the participants**
	+ Icebreaker
+ **Set ground rules**
	+ No judgement
	+ Break every 90 minutes
+ **Set expectations**
	+ It's common that this might feel too rushed
	+ Often it will feel like we're losing ideas because we're moving fast
	+ The exercises will feel weird/awkward, and that's totally normal
	+ Normal not to have any ideas yet
	+ Normal to feel like it's not going to work
+ **Get expectations**
	+ What are you hoping to get out of this?
	+ What will make this worthwhile for you?
	+ What do you hope to achieve today?
+ **Agenda and Structure**

###### How to Give Clear Instructions
+ **Formula for Clear Instructions**
	+ What (the exercise)
	+ Why (reason)
	+ How (instructions)
+ **Remember the 3X Rule**
	+ To minimize the chances of anyone missing a vital piece pf info, make sure to say important things 3 times
	+ No need to repeat exactlly thr same, judt make sure to reiterate your point or provide several examples
+ **Remove unnecessary options**
	+ More options only add confusion
	+ Only show one way of doing an exercise
+ **Show, don't tell**
	+ Examples help us understand concepts better since they take ideas from an abstract descriptionand make them concrete by giving them context
+ **Use insight statements**
	+ There's only so much the mind can absorb before losing focus
	+ While it's good to give a detailed explanation of a concept/excercise, make sure to summarize it with an insight statement
	+ An insight statement tells people the "why" and gives context for the task
	+ Examples:
		+ The big idea with this excercise is...
		+ The most important thing about this is...
		+ The way to do this excercise well is...

###### Principles of Remote Facilitation
1. **Energy**
	1. Bring way more energy than you normally would
	2. Leave time for a warm-up and icebreaker activity
	3. Put on some workshoppy music
	4. Have more breaks than you would in a normal workshop
2. **Communication**
	1. Slow down
	2. Buffer in a bit more time for discussions
3. **Guidance**
	1. Make use of progressive disclosure: only share information participants need to know
	2. Minimize the neec to switch between a video call and the remote collaboration board
4. **Sort Out the Tech**
	1. Have a plan B for every single tool you're using
	2. Prepare for the worst-case scenario, have several backups
5. **Simplicity**
	1. Keep it simple
	2. Don't overcomplicate
