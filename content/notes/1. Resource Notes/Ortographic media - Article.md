## Highlights
-  [[context collapse]] is the standardization of all events to fit in one generic timeline. Other definitions: ==flattening== multiple audiences into a single context, or multiple audiences revolve around singular communicative acts....etc. Basically lack of perspective. See Julie Zhou's Looking Glass.
> the ==standardization== of all events, no matter how big or small, delightful or traumatic, to fit the same mashed-together timeline.
- Questions to consider when dealing with social media: (related to [[Everyone always acts in accordance with their internal narratives]])
	- What would this platform look like with a re-established perspective?
	- Consider if the news matters to you and your community
>   First, what would it look like for a social media platform to ==re-establish perspective?== To attenuate the strength of signals over distanceâ€”not geographic distance, necessarily, but other kinds? (This is obviously related to my broad interest in adding more negative [feedback](https://platforms.fyi/) to these platforms.)
> Second, in the absence of any such attenuation, I think a practical and healthy thing that any user of social media can do when confronted with a free-floating cube of news is ask: ==how big is this, really? Does it matter to me and my community? Does it, in fact, matter anywhere except the particular place it happened?==
