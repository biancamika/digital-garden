	+ credentialing ==work over background==
	+ records your work, impact, peer review, so that you can get paid for it
	+ other traits:
		+ free syllabi and lectures
		+ assignments -> points
			+ how can we avoid [pointsification](https://afabrega.com/my-blog/gamification-vs-pointsification)?
		+ peer assessors also earn points for awarding NFT prizes
		+ points + nfts earn tokens from protocols, w/ extra apy for signing job contract
		+ protocols pay to recruit students
	+ notes: 
		+ objective assessment (jobs completed) shows quantity, not quality
		+ subjective assessment (awards) is decentralized metric of quality for creative work
		+ asessments sadly needed to spare recruiting time, but all work is ==on-chain ==and open to ==alternate credentials==
+ **Web3 Book Club**
	+ learn-to-earn: anyone can pursue education + work in meaningful ways
	+ people learn web3 by ==taking classes through DAOs and participating in DAOs==, while getting paid for it
	+ other traits:
		+ ==public/open-source== syllabi, lectures, podcast discussions
		+ any DAO can use these to build community, generate insights
			+ E.G. KERNEL by Gitcoin
		+ readers find DAO book clubs through marketplace
		+ DAOs pay readers for completing book club
		+ you get cut of pay
	+ Essentially a ==marketplace protocol== that lets:
		+ people create book club materials
		+ DAOs offer them to their communities
		+ DAOs draw and pay memebrs for ==building community==, the most important work people can do for DAOs
	+ Principles:
		+ Build community in ==public==
			+ All materials + meetings are free & open-source
			+ this lets anyone learn, drawing more attention for DAOs and material-creators
		+ Learn-to-earn
			+ Inspiration: DAOhaus bookclub, Rabbithole drawing users to protocols
			+ Additional elements:
				+ anyone can create materials
				+ creating an ==on-chain resume== of empathetic community building
		+ DAO composability
			+ ==positive-sum==, supporting one another
			+ protocol can be...
				+ DAO of creators monetizing by sharing materials w/ other DAOs
				+ tool for DAOs to build materials to share w/ other DAOs
