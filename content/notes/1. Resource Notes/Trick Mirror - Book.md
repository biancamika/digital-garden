## Highlights
- As more people began to register their existence digitally, a pastime turned into an imperative: you had to register yourself digitally to exist.
    - The I in the Internet, p. 5
- The call of self-expression turned the village of the internet into a city, which expanded at time-lapse speed, social connections bristling like neurons in every direction.
    - The I in the Internet, p. 7
- Where we had once been free to be ourselves online, we were now chained to ourselves online, and this made us self-conscious.
    - The I in the Internet, p. 7
- But you can’t just walk around and be visible on the internet—for anyone to see you, you have to act.
    - The I in the Internet, p. 8
- our world—digitally mediated, utterly consumed by capitalism—makes communication about morality very easy but makes actual moral living very hard.

- The internet reminds us on a daily basis that it is not at all rewarding to become aware of problems that you have no reasonable hope of solving.
    - The I in the Internet, p. 11
- five intersecting problems: first, how the internet is built to distend our sense of identity; second, how it encourages us to overvalue our opinions; third, how it maximizes our sense of opposition; fourth, how it cheapens our understanding of solidarity; and, finally, how it destroys our sense of scale.
    - The I in the Internet, p. 12
- The self is not a fixed, organic thing, but a dramatic effect that emerges from a performance. This effect can be believed or disbelieved at will.

- Online, your audience can hypothetically keep expanding forever, and the performance never has to end.
    - The I in the Internet, p. 15
- The representation of an activity will vary in some degree from the activity itself and therefore inevitably misrepresent it

- an open-ended, affinity-based, generative online identity is hard to keep alive.
    - The I in the Internet, p. 22
- But the internet brings the “I” into everything. The internet can make it seem that supporting someone means literally sharing in their experience—that solidarity is a matter of identity rather than politics or morality, and that it’s best established at a point of maximum mutual vulnerability in everyday life.

	- December 28, 2019
	- Always Be Optimizing, p. 65
- She can believe—reasonably enough, and with the full encouragement of feminism—that she herself is the architect of the exquisite, constant, and often pleasurable type of power that this image holds over her time, her money, her decisions, her selfhood, and her soul.

- women, formed in a way that makes us inextricable from social and technological machinery, could become fluid and radical and resistant. We could be like cyborgs—shaped in an image we didn’t choose for ourselves, and disloyal and disobedient as a result.
	- December 29, 2019
	- Always Be Optimizing, p. 92
- Resistance to a system is presented on the terms of the system. It’s so much easier, when we gain agency, to adapt rather than to oppose.
	- December 30, 2019
	- Always Be Optimizing, p. 93
- Technology, in fact, has made us less than oppositional: where beauty is concerned, we have deployed technology not only to meet the demands of the system but to actually expand these demands.

	- Always Be Optimizing, p. 93
- a girl is a “human being before becoming a woman,” and she “knows already that to accept herself as a woman is to become resigned and to mutilate herself.” This is part of the reason these childhood characters are all so independent, so eager to make the most of whatever presents itself: they—or, more to the point, their creators—understand that adulthood is always looming, which means marriage and children, which means, in effect, the end.

- affidamento, or “entrustment,”
	- December 30, 2019
	- Pure Heroines, p. 125
- When two women “entrusted” themselves to each other, they prioritized not their similarities but their differences.

- Entrustment was a framework that not only allowed them to understand themselves as both woman and human, but consciously predicated the second identity on the first.
- December 30, 2019
- Pure Heroines, p. 128
- The heroine’s journey, or her lack of one, serves as a reminder that whatever is dictated is not eternal, not predestined, not necessarily true. The trajectory of literary women from brave to blank to bitter is a product of material social conditions. The fact that the heroine’s journey is framed as a default one for women is proof of our failure to see, for so long, that other paths were possible, and that many other ones exist.

- But even the suggestion that I was making something out of nothing made me wonder if I was, in fact, making something out of nothing. I started wanting things to happen to me, as if to prove to myself that I wasn’t crazy, wasn’t hallucinating. Spiky with resentment, I glared at men who looked at me too closely, daring them to give me another event to write down in my little secret file of incidents, daring them to make visible the dawning sense I had of women living in a continual state of violation, daring them to help me realize that I wasn’t making any of this up.

- the story didn’t need to be clean, and it didn’t need to be satisfying; that, in fact, it would never be clean or satisfying, and once I realized that, I would be able to see what was true.
