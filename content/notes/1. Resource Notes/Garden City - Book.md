## Highlights
- Because when we stop working, we lose a part of who we are.

- In   Genesis ’s   vision   of   humanness,   we   don’t   work   to   live;   we   live   to   work .   It   flat   out   says   we   were   created   to rule — to make something of God’s world. 
	- LOCATION: Page 21
- your   work   is   a   core   part   of   your   humanness.   You   are   made   in   the   image   of   a   work- ing   God.   God   is   king   over   the   world,   and   you’re   a   king,   a   queen   —   royalty   —   ruling   on   his   behalf.   Gathering   up the creation’s praise and somehow pushing it back to God himself. 
	- LOCATION: Page 35
- But   in   a Genesis -shaped   worldview   —   all   of   life   is   worship. 
	- LOCATION: Page 42
- work is “rearranging the raw material of God’s cre- ation   in   such   a   way   that   it   helps   the   world   in   general,   and   people   in   particular,   thrive   and   flourish.” 
	- LOCATION: Page 44
- Good culture is the result of even better people hard at work, rearranging the   raw   stuff   of   Planet   Earth   into   a   place   of   delight. 
	- LOCATION: Page 44
- creation   was   a project ,   not   a   product. 
	- LOCATION: Page 45
- You are a modern day Adam or Eve. This world is what’s left of the Garden. And your job is to take all the raw   materials   that   are   spread   out   in   front   of   you,   to   work   it ,   to   take   care   of   it ,   to   rule ,   to   subdue ,   to   wrestle,   to fight, to explore, and to take the creation project forward as an act of service and worship to the God who made you. 
	- LOCATION: Page 47
- The   word   vocatio   can   also   be   translated   voice .   Man,   that   says   a   lot.   Your   vocation   is   your   voice. 
	- LOCATION: Page 52
- Calling   isn’t   something   you   choose ,   like   who   you   marry   or   what   house   you   buy   or   what   car   you   buy;   it’s something you unearth. You excavate. You dig out. And you discover.
	- LOCATION: Page 52
- Because   in   a   Hebrew   worldview,   all   of   life   is   spiritual. 	
	- LOCATION: Page 69
- All   the   word   ministry   means   is   “service.” ⁸   Your   ministry   is   your   service   —   it’s   the   part   you   play,   the   slot   you fill, the place you do your thing to work for a Garden-like world.

- The   idea   behind   kavod   is   God’s   significance .   He’s   weighty,   as   in   important .   There’s   something   about   this God that we need to stand in awe of. And all through the Scriptures, God’s glory is about two things: Presence and beauty. 
	- LOCATION: Page 83
- God’s   kavod   here   isn’t   his   fame;   it’s   his   presence   —   the   fact   that   he   was   there ,   not   far   away,   but   close.   Heav- en and earth were wed, if only for a moment. And it’s his beauty — this staggering sense of how good he really is. 
	- LOCATION: Page 84
- Our job is to make the invisible God visible — to mirror and mimic what he is like to the world. We can glorify God by doing our work in such a way that we make   the   invisible   God   visible   by   what   we   do   and   how   we   do   it. 
	- LOCATION: Page 87
- When   we   see   the   world   in   the   shape   that   God   intended,   the   way   it’s   supposed   to   be,   God   gets   glory,   without a   word . 
	- LOCATION: Page 89
- As   people   made   in   God’s   image,   we   can   join   him   in   this   ongoing   creative   work.   As   his   partners,   we   can   re- shape   the   raw   materials   of   his   world   in   such   a   way   that   people   see   the   beauty   behind   the   beauty. 
	- LOCATION: Page 88
- God is a lavish, opulent,   extravagant   artist ,   and   creation   is   his   beauty   on   display. 
	- LOCATION: Page 89
- As people made in his image — all work is artistic. All work is inherently creative. All work — from painting to parenting — is reshaping the raw materials of Planet Earth in such a way that it’s how God intended, how it’s supposed to be, all so humans can thrive as they see God’s glory. 
	- LOCATION: Page 91
- We   are   fractured   and   pulled   in   a   thousand   different   directions. ADHD, stress, workaholism, burnout, connectivity — these are just words we come up with to name a world that is unraveling at the seams. 
	- LOCATION: Page 97
- Discipleship   is   about   learning   how   to   become   a   good   human   being.   And   how   to   live   into   both   your   callings, to   make   disciples   and   to   create   culture.  
	- LOCATION: Page 99
- To   focus,   we   need   to   know   what   we’re   called   by   God   to   do,   and   what   we’re   not   called   to   do.
	- LOCATION: Page 103
- To borrow from the language of Jesus, you gotta figure what the “work the Father gave you to do” is. And   then   you   need   to   learn   the   art   of   saying   no.   To   good   things .   A   smart   man   once   said,   “Good   is   the   enemy of   best.” ¹⁷
	- LOCATION: Page 106
- A genuine, authentic love of excellence isn’t rooted in greed or narcissism or materialism — that’s dualism talking.   It’s   rooted   in   love ,   for   God   and   others.   A   desire   to   serve   God   and   his   world   well.
	- LOCATION: Page 107
- Dorothy Sayers, this spunky, rebellious British writer from half a century ago, said that the best way to serve others with our work is to “serve the work.”
	- LOCATION: Page 108
- So we all have gifts, but we don’t all have the same dosage of grace. Some of us have more; others have less. And that’s okay. Your   job   isn’t   to   be   the   best   in   your   field,   just   the   best   version   of   yourself.
	- LOCATION: Page 108
- Do one thing. And   do   one   thing   well . And do that one thing well as an act of service and love for the world and to the glory of God.
	- LOCATION: Page 111
- If you’re really good at whatever it is you do, you don’t need to tell the rest of us. We’ll know. Beautiful things don’t ask for attention.
	- LOCATION: Page 112
- “Good design is putting our best forward; it is working hard to bring beauty into the world. When I see something that is brilliant it wrecks me in the best sort of way. I am also constantly returning to this idea that we were created with the ability to create and that makes our God the most generous of all. I’m humbled after I complete every new project, and as I stand there with a big silly grin on my face, I feel his presence and ap- proval.”
	- LOCATION: Page 112
- My point is that as human beings, we have this slant to look to our work for significance we can only find in God. When we uncouple our work from God, work becomes a sort of god in and of itself.
	- LOCATION: Page 120
- Because the curse drives us to God. If it weren’t for the curses — on both the family and the field — we would look to whatever it is we do for work   or   rest,   and   we   would   find   it .   And   nothing   could   be   more   disastrous   for   the   world   than   God’s   image   bear- ers finding identity and belonging and even satisfaction apart from him.

- Sabbath   isn’t   just   a   day   to   not   work ;   it’s   a   day   to   delight   in   what   one   Hebrew   poet   called   “the   work   of   our hands.” ³   To   delight   in   the   life   you’ve   carved   out   in   partnership   with   God,   to   delight   in   the   world   around   you, and to delight in God himself. Sabbath is a day to pull up a chair, sink into it, look back over the work of the last six   days,   and   just   enjoy .
	- LOCATION: Page 134
- The Sabbath has a life-giving ability to procreate — to fill the world up with life.
	- LOCATION: Page 136
- But   rest   refills   us   —   with   energy,   creativity,   vision,   strength,   optimism,   buoy- ancy, clarity, and hope. Rest is life-giving.
	- LOCATION: Page 136
- It’s   a   day   for   rest,   and   it’s   a   day   for   worship. When I Sabbath, I run everything through this grid — is this rest? Is this worship? If the answer to both questions is yes, then I delight in it; if the answer is no, then I hold off until the next day. Because the Sabbath is not the same thing as a day off.
	- LOCATION: Page 138
- These are the signs of a life without rest.
	- LOCATION: Page 140
- The   point   is   that   there   is   a   way   the   Creator   set   the   creation up   to   thrive.   A   way   that   God   set   you   up   to   thrive.   And   when   we   Sabbath,   we   tap   into   God’s   rhythm   for   human flourishing.
	- LOCATION: Page 141
- The Sabbath is a day to embrace this reality, to let it sink in, to own it, to celebrate it. To celebrate our weak- ness,   our   mortality,   our   limits .   To   celebrate   our   God   of   strength   and   immortality   and   limitless   power.   To   rest with   him   and   to   rest   in   him.
	- LOCATION: Page 142
- Everything   we enjoy costs something. And if it doesn’t cost us, it costs someone else.
	- LOCATION: Page 149
- The Sabbath is about leaving Egypt behind. About emancipation from Pharaoh’s suffocating rule. It’s about freedom.
	- LOCATION: Page 150
- It’s   a   way   to   remember   and   never   forget   that   what   we’re   craving,   and   even coveting, isn’t found in the world of space, but in the world of time — in God himself.
	- LOCATION: Page 155
- The Sabbath is more of an art form than a list of dos and don’ts.
	- LOCATION: Page 160
- the   Sabbath   is   a   day   for   healing.
	- LOCATION: Page 163
- Jesus is the embodiment of the Sabbath. He’s the seventh day in flesh and blood. We can come to him and find   rest ,   not   just   on   the   Sabbath,   but   all   week   long.
	- LOCATION: Page 166
- Sabbath isn’t just a Pause button — it’s a full, complete, total system restart.
	- LOCATION: Page 166
- Sabbath is a chance to take a long, hard look at our lives and to retune them to the right key. To make sure that our life is shaped around what really matters. And when we see stuff in our life that is out of whack, then we turn to Jesus, and he comes and does his healing Sabbath work.

- our   eschatology   shapes   our   ethics.
	- LOCATION: Page 180
- Work   isn’t   a   means   to   an   end;   it   is   an   end.
	- LOCATION: Page 182
- Our   work   in   this   life   is   practice   for   our   work   in   the   coming   life.
	- LOCATION: Page 183
- Some of the good work we do will actually last into God’s new world.
	- LOCATION: Page 184
- So   we   work   in   the   present   world   —   right   in   the   middle   of   all   the   chaos   and   entropy   and   suffering   and   pain   — for   a   glimpse   of   the   future   world,   set   free   from   evil   and   death   itself.

- Do your work as an expression of love and service, ultimately to God, and then to your neighbor.
