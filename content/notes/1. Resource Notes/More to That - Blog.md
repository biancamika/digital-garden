### The Information Lifecycle: How Three Filters Shape the Mind
-  Attention is a ==zero-sum game.==
-  The moment an unknown fact passes through awareness, it becomes data, not information. This distinction is important. ==Data does not have to be processed, whereas information does.==
-  The utility of data lies in ==our ability to react to it.== If we have either the ==intellectual or emotional capacity== to process it, only then does it becomes information.
-  Whenever we point to “information abundance,” what we are really saying is that we have ==“endless opportunities to react to data.”==
-  This whole process of ==previously unknown facts eventually shaping one’s perspective== is what I call the information lifecycle.

-  The first filter is ==awareness.== This is governed by ==curiosity.==
	-  There are ==shades== to curiousity, from its purest form to its most restrictive.
-  Whatever passes through becomes data, but in order for that to be processed as information, it must pass through the ==filter of reactivity.==
	-  What allows one to adjust the filter of reactivity is the ==strength of their capabilities.== Data becomes information only when you have the cognitive capacity to interpret it as such.
-  Interpreting information has less to do with curiosity, and more to do with ==diligence.== Curiosity was the force that brought me to the book, but diligence is what will make that book a useful source of [knowledge](https://moretothat.com/framework-for-knowledge/).
-  Once that information is processed, we then have the option to incorporate it into our worldview, or discard it altogether. This is decided by the final bottleneck: ==the filter of identity.==
	-  Identity is the collection of beliefs, ideas, and truths you hold to position yourself within the world. No matter how independent you think you are, identity is ==always constructed in relationship to something else that exists alongside you.==
	-  Identities organize the familiar, but divide the unfamiliar. ==The more we love the idea of “us,” the more we hate the idea of “them.”==
-  The only way we could break away from this (balancing inclusivity and exclusivity) is to ==free ourselves from the notion of identity as much as possible.== Krishnamurti calls this [“freedom from conditioning,”](https://amzn.to/3gskMDy) where we are able to ==let go of all the societal influences== that have shaped and categorized us into certain roles.
-  The less we need to rely on our identities to make sense of information, ==the more we can learn about the world, and uncover our true place within it.==
	-  Without cultivating curiosity, the awareness filter remains closed to any facts in the first place.
	-  Without updating our capabilities, we can’t react to whatever data we discover.
	-  And without letting go of identity, no amount of information will ever shift our perspective.
