## Highlights
### Introduction
> The question *are we human?* is from the beginning a hesitation about the relationship between ourselves and everything around or inside us.

> If the human is a question mark, design is the way that question is engaged. An archaeology of design is an archaeology of curiousity.

### 1. The Mirror of Design

> Design always presents itself as serving the human but its real ambition is to redesign the human. 

> The history of design is therefore a history of evolving conceptions of the human. To talk about design is to talk about the state of our species.

> We literally live inside design...design has become the world.

> To think about design demands an archaeological approach. You have to dig...Digging, documenting, dissecting, discussing -- digging, that is, into ourselves.

> [Archaeology] is a kind of reverse engineering of design.

> Design is a form of projection, to shape something rather than to find it, to invent something and think about the possible outcomes of that invention.

> The human might be the only species to have systematically designed its own extinction, and seems to be getting close to accomplishing the goal.

> Our self-image is multiple and ever-shifting, as if we look into a vast multifaceted mirror in which the surfaces keep moving.

> The ability to see so much more is equally the ability to be seen much more...Self-monitoring is a huge part of human activity -- and is insperable from design.

> Artifacts become truly transformative by exceeding what was expected of them, exceeding our grasp. It is precisely in challenging us -- triggering the potential of new ways of seeing, thinking, grasping, and acting -- that design plays its role in redefining the human.


### 2. The Plastic Human

> Human is an unstable category, even an unstable being...it is defined by its diversity and plasticity -- its ability to modify its own abilities...it is this plasticity that is the basis of its massive impact...in redesigning itself, it redesigns the planet.

> What makes the human human is...in our interdependency with artifacts...the human is insperable from the artifacts that it produces...the human emerges in the redefinition of capacity provided by the artifacts. In a sense, the artifacts are more human than the human.

> Artifacts are therefore never simply the representstives of human intentions and abilities. They are also openings, possibilities of something new in the human, even a new human. There is always a gap between intentions and what is produced. The artifact offers something unexpected, some additional quality or resistance. This excess opens up new ways of thinking, new modes of design.

> ...histories of the human are histories of artifacts and the interactivities between artifacts, seen as potentials rather than accomplishments, as if the Earth is a vast design studio in which human capacity is being tinkered with in unexpected ways.

> Artifacts are interfaces, enabling different forms of human engagement with the world but equally enabling the world to engage with the human differently.

> The archaeology of design is...the history of a question mark.

### 3. Blows of Design
> The objects were not just made, they were thought...they are human artifacts because the regularity of the shape "surely implies design, the application of forethought, and an intelligent purpose." The physical implement is first and foremost an instrument of thought.

+ We're older than we think...and more intelligent too.... we challenged religious notions by discovering  prehistory
+ Charles Darwin: "unity of design" is not because of divine intelligence, but because it is a product of the essential mutability of all species
	+ Countless incremental adaptations increase the chances of survival in changing environments

> Natural selection is design without a designer.

> The human hand is uniquely adapted to make and use tools. The inherited structure of the body ultimately altered by its technological extensions...human designs eventually redesign the human. We are gradually redesigned by our tools.

> The sustained attempt to develop and promote a concept of "design" in everyday objects as a necessary response to the massive impact of industrialization on human life was made during the dramatic encounter with the design of the very first tools and with a destabilizing sense of intimacy with apes and the extended organic world.

> Design itself was understood as the very principle of human evolution in an uncritical celebration of progress -- as if nothing was more human than the ability to modernize oneself.

> The concept of modern design...was part of the ongoing testing of [established concepts of human biological and technological evolution].

> In the end, the design of the earliest tools might be as much about their ornamental beauty as about defined function, visually striking designs to help the survival of the craftsperson's genes by attracting mates.

> If design is the first sign of the human, it is the beginning of a permanent question.

### 4. The Invention of the Human
> The human becomes human in seeing itself in the things it makes, or seeing its possibility in those things. So the human doesn't simply invent tools. Tools invent the human. More precisely, tool and human produce each other. The artifacts that prosthetically expand thought and reach are what make the human human.

> The body itself is only human by virtue of technology: "the human hand is human because of what it makes, not of what it is."

> The human brain is therefore an effect of new tools rather than the generator of new tools.

> ...a tool is not produced to carry out a defined utilitarian task. Tools are born as challenges to existing concepts of utility. They open up new understandings of what could be useful. Utility is not a given unambiguous need. Ambiguity about utility is what drives new forms of utility.

> ...the main driver of human accomplishment is simply a unique human capacity for variability, an impulse to generate a multiciplity of ways to do things in reaction to different cirumstances...this variability itself can be understood as design capacity...Humans continuously imagine different ways even in the same context, to the point of malfunction.

> The human brain itself is a malleable artifact whose circuits are continually rearranged through engagement with material culture. It is an unfinished project with a forever uncertain future and an equally uncertain beginning.

> Design is by definition unevenly distributed in space and time, often flickering as some innovations disappear for a very long time only to be reinvented again.

> The human is permanently suspended between being the cause and effect, between designing living things and being designed by them.

> What is human in the end is neither the designer nor the artifacts but their interdependency.

### 5. The Ornamental Species
> The symptoms of recognizably human behavior were the sophistication and complexity of tools, symbols, rituals, and techniques. Even then, this acceleration only became exponential in the last 12,000 years, when "humans redesigned themselves as organic beings," as John Hoffecker puts it, with abstract thinking, composite tools, long-distane networks of production and exchange, cooperative labor, and so on. Countless inventions steadily transformed the species and dramatically altered its relationship to the environment through the "domestication (that is, *re*designing) of plants and animals."

> Ornaments are a key symptom of the human ability to externalize its thoughts in symbolic form -- generating and sharing information rather than simply processing it.

> Ornament both marks and expands the human. It is both a sign of the ability to invent and the very mechanism of invention.

> Ornament...is both a tool of communication and the opening to new forms of tool...

> The human is that species that keeps reflecting on the possible uses of its artifacts and communicating these reflections by making new artifacts, flickering back and forth between ornament and tool.

> ...this multiplicity and malleability...is evidence of the capacity to invent that makes us human, that invents the human even.

> ...what is seen as ornament is doing the real work and what looks like a tool is really for show. And the vibration between them is the very engine of design.

> Design routinely constructs digital inequalities...it is everywhere, and it engineers concentrations of wealth and privilege.
