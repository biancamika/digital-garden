## Highlights
> While most have heard of the World's Fairs, few know how important they were in shaping our culture. Drawing more than 60 million guests in the 1960s alone, these 6-month long mega-events gave us a place to celebrate our achievements and experience the future up close and in person. ==They promoted a collective vision for a better world — reminding us how connected we were and how far we could go if only we went together.==

> We now have the tools, resources, and means of coordination to reach heights that seemed impossible just four decades ago. Imagine the problems we could now solve and the feats we could achieve if we began to pursue a new, collective vision for the future.

> And to arrive at this vision, we must have a ==global conversation== about the world we want to live in. However, holding that conversation today is even harder than in the past. ==The digital dominance of the 21st Century has sorted us into our own tailored versions of online reality, where we drown in ads and information.== It's overwhelming, noisy, and ephemeral. It's hard to have a simple conversation, let alone align the globe on a future worth building.

> This is why we must look to the past — to the World's Fairs — to build the future. By stepping out of the virtual world and into the physical one, ==we can literally create common ground for the people of the world to discuss nuance, and channel their focus — at scale.==

> Through compelling pavilions and exhibits, awe-inspiring art and architecture, and incredibly immersive experiences, we can design ==a physical space where everyone can feel, touch, and see the future==. We can take advantage of our existing digital infrastructure and the latest virtualization technologies to deliver ==a complementary experience that spreads the future to billions of people, allowing voices from all walks of life to participate in the conversation.== We can build a new World's Stage — the intellectual equivalent of the Olympics — where heroes and role models are created, where dreams are born, and where we celebrate achievement over superficial influence. We can build a new medium that keeps us pointed towards a North Star: helping us find our next great step, focus on it, and celebrate its achievement together.
