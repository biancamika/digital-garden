[How Roblox is Exploiting Young Game Developers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gXlauRB1EQ)

> “With most of the games on the platform being made by minors and ==a revenue split that's just one third of the industry standard==, we looked into whether these young developers were in fact being exploited.” (Traditionally, game stores have taken a 30 percent cut of revenue that publishers earn on their platforms, and hand 70 percent over to the devs. _Roblox_ [gives developers](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/articles/developer-economics) just 25 percent, plus payouts based on engagement.)

> People Make Games’ analysis of _Roblox_’s economics highlights the chasm between _Roblox_’s promise as a way for kids to become game developers and the reality: ==It is very challenging to make money on _Roblox_, and _Roblox_ profits from people trying.==

> _Roblox_ provides a lot for its developers: server space, marketplace infrastructure, cross-platform capability. Roblox Studio is, like the game, free. Developers can make money through _Roblox_ with its [Developer Exchange program](https://www.roblox.com/develop/developer-exchange), or DevEx, which gives developers 25 percent of a game’s earnings. (Part of _Roblox_’s [justification](https://venturebeat.com/2017/07/21/the-deanbeat-robloxs-kid-developers-make-enough-robucks-to-pay-for-college/) for this split is its huge investment in infrastructure for these devs.) _Roblox_’s VP of marketing [told](https://www.alistdaily.com/strategy/roblox-discovering-future-game-developers-entrepreneurs/) _AListDaily_ in 2018, “From the very beginning, it was about having kids develop games for other kids.” DevEx’s [terms](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005718246-Developer-Exchange-Terms-of-Use) require users to be 13 or over.

> It wasn’t easy. To withdraw money earned through microtransactions in a game, a developer must earn a ==minimum ==of 100,000 Robux, the platform’s in-game currency. Buying 100,000 Robux through _Roblox_’s store costs $1,000.= Selling 100,000 Robux back to _Roblox_ earns you just $350. ==Withdrawal is not even possible unless these developers pay a five-dollar monthly fee for a _Roblox_ Premium Subscription.== (_Second Life_ and _Entropia Universe_, which also allow players to sell items, respectively have $10 and $100 minimums for withdrawing money.)

> Smith believes ==this setup disincentivizes users from withdrawing Robux. They’re devalued off-platform, so why not spend them on other _Roblox_ games?== Smith compares _Roblox_’s currency to mining camps’ company scrips, a now-illegal currency used by miners to purchase goods at company stores. Miners were encouraged to spend their money on their employers’ goods because, elsewhere, the scrip was moot.

> A _Roblox_ spokesperson tells _WIRED_ that ==“building experiences on Roblox teaches the fundamentals of coding, digital civility, and entrepreneurship and has helped many begin their careers in STEM.” ==_Roblox_ gave developers $129.7 million in the second quarter of 2021, and according to the spokesperson, over 600 developers earn over $85,000 a year from their _Roblox_ creations. The company also hosts programs and offers Developer Relations professionals to help developers succeed.
