## Highlights
- You can’t understand the world better simply by reading about it as much as possible. You do so by being intentional about what you pay attention to in the first place.
	- LOCATION: Page 20
- What   if   the   secret   to   having   better   ideas   that   clients   loved   was   to   get   better   at   curating   them   be- fore I needed them?
	- LOCATION: Page 22
- Seeing the non-obvious makes you more open minded to change and can help you disrupt instead of getting disrupted.
	- LOCATION: Page 26
- Engaging in non-obvious thinking starts with adopting a growth mindset. 
	- LOCATION: Page 29
- Non-Obvious Mindset 1: Be Observant Pay attention to the world, and train yourself to notice the details that others miss.
	- LOCATION: Page 30
- Being observant isn’t simply about seeing the big things. It’s also about training yourself to pay attention to the little things.

- Non-Obvious Mindset 2: Be Curious Ask questions, invest in learning, and approach unfamiliar situations with a sense of wonder. 
	- LOCATION: Page 34
- why curiosity matters: It’s a prerequisite to discovery. 
	- LOCATION: Page 34
- The more we know about a topic, for example, the more difficult it becomes to think outside our expertise and broaden our view. Psychologists describe this phenomenon as the “curse of knowledge.”

- Non-Obvious Mindset 3: Be Fickle Save interesting ideas for later consumption without overanalyzing them in the moment. 
	- LOCATION: Page 37
- Any experienced facilitator or creative coach will tell you that the best way to kill the flow of a brainstorming session is to dwell on individual ideas. Ideation and analysis need a buffer of time between them for either to be effective. 
	- LOCATION: Page 38
- Being fickle isn’t about abandoning ideas too quickly or being unable to focus. It’s about freeing yourself from the pressure to recognize connections among ideas immediately and making it easier to return to a collec- tion of ideas to analyze them later.

- if you want to get better at antici- pating the future, start by getting better at understanding the present. 
	- LOCATION: Page 46
- A   trend   is   a   cu- rated observation of the accelerating present. 
	- LOCATION: Page 46
- Although some trends may seem to spotlight a currently popular story or cultural event, they typically describe behaviors and beliefs that develop over time. Fads describe something that’s briefly popular but doesn’t last. Great trends reflect a mo- ment in time, but that moment is never fleeting, and the basic idea is more elevated. Good trends always focus on the shift in an underlying human behavior or belief. They don’t describe a sin- gle interesting story or a hot new product or industry. 
	- LOCATION: Page 46
- Trend spotting isn’t the same as identifying actual trends. When you focus on spotting stories that stand out, you   gravitate   toward   collecting   interesting   ideas   without   understanding   the   broader   context   of   what   they   mean . 
	- LOCATION: Page 47
- The Haystack Method is a process for curating trends that starts with gathering stories and ideas and sorting them into groups that make sense (the hay), then analyzing each of the groups to see whether they reveal an underlying trend (the needle). 
	- LOCATION: Page 47
- The HayStack Method: STEP 1 Gathering Gathering is the disciplined act of collecting stories and ideas while taking notes of why they are interesting. 
	- LOCATION: Page 48
- The key is to give yourself a reminder of what you found interesting about the story when you saved it. This will make your notes more useful when you return to them later. 
	- LOCATION: Page 49
- FOCUS   ON   INSIGHTS. 
	- LOCATION: Page 49
- Don’t try to summarize everything about the article or idea; instead focus on what made the idea memorable or any insights you had at the moment you saved it. 2. ADD   LABELS.   Use   “note   boxes”   to   make   your   notes   easily   skimmable.   Write   a   few   key   words   in a box next to your notes as a reminder why you chose the article or idea.

- Perspective often comes from the passage of time and the patience to allow patterns to emerge on their own. The HayStack Method: STEP 2 Aggregating Aggregating is the process of grouping ideas together to uncover bigger themes. 
	- LOCATION: Page 53
- During this stage, you need to resist grouping ideas by industry or topic. Instead, aggregate ideas and articles based on human motivations or broader themes. 
	- LOCATION: Page 54
- START WITH HUMAN NEEDS. 
	- LOCATION: Page 56
- the basic human need for belonging fuels many activities that people engage in online, from sharing their images on social media to join- ing online communities. • RECOGNIZE THE OBVIOUS. 
	- LOCATION: Page 56
- SAVE UNUSUAL IDEAS. 
	- LOCATION: Page 56
- The HayStack Method: STEP 3 Elevating Elevating involves identifying the underlying themes that align a group of ideas to describe a single, bigger con- cept. 
	- LOCATION: Page 56
- Your aim in this step should be to identify bigger ideas that bring many stories together.

- MASHUP WORDS. 
	- LOCATION: Page 65
- The   best   mashups   are   easy   to   pronounce   and   sound   as   close   to   a   real word as possible. • ADD ALLITERATION. 
	- LOCATION: Page 65
- GO FOR A TWIST. By taking an obvious phrase or a commonly used term and inserting a small change, you end up with   a   name   that   surprises   and   stands   out.  
	- LOCATION: Page 65
- The HayStack Method: STEP 5 Proving Proving entails seeking out data, stories, and conversations to validate whether a collection of ideas can justi- fiably be described as a trend. 
	- LOCATION: Page 66
- My team and I evaluate trends using a framework of three key elements: the core idea of the trend, its impact, and its acceleration. 
	- LOCATION: Page 66
- FOCUS ON VARIETY. 
	- LOCATION: Page 69
- If a trend is going to describe how business is done or how con- sumers behave, it should be supported by examples or cases in many industries. • WATCH YOUR BIASES. 
	- LOCATION: Page 69
- Non-obvious trends are not self-serving. • USE AUTHORITATIVE SOURCES.
	- LOCATION: Page 69
- if you are going to hone your ability to curate trends, you must embrace the notion that sometimes you will be wrong.

- As individualism rises globally, people are carefully cultivating how they are perceived both online and off- line, chasing stardom, and making themselves vulnerable to criticism in the process.

- Amplified Identity
	- LOCATION: Page 100
- Studies indicate that instead of making us self-centered liars, social media may be giving us the one thing we need to shape our identities in a digital world: power over our stories.
	- LOCATION: Page 104
- by engaging in public shaming, we are “defining the boundaries of normality by tearing apart the people outside of it.”
	- LOCATION: Page 107
- A growing worldwide shift toward individuality and the means to control our stories is driving us all spend more time thinking about how we present ourselves.

- CONSIDER   THE   IDENTITY   DIVIDE .
	- LOCATION: Page 111
- Remember that at the core of most social media activities is the normal desire to find one’s own identity and share it with the world. That’s not narcissism. It’s human nature.

- Ungendering
	- LOCATION: Page 115
- Traditional gender divisions and labels are getting replaced with a more fluid understanding of gender iden- tity, forcing a reevaluation of how we see employees, customers, brands and one another.
	- LOCATION: Page 115
- In the information economy, our attention is our most valuable resource, leading us to be more skeptical of those who manipulate us to get it, and instead seek out and trust those who communicate in more authen- tic ways.
	- LOCATION: Page 131
- Attention Wealth
	- LOCATION: Page 131
- Stories are a powerful tool because the human brain is more in- clined to pay attention to an engaging narrative than to a bunch of facts. Knowing this, brands are trying to win our attention and earn our trust by sharing their back stories and vulnerabilities.
	- LOCATION: Page 135
- Technology that helps people or companies with self-serving intentions manufacture content that captures our attention and distorts the truth will continue to grow more sophisticated. As a result, we will become more skeptical of content in general, even that produced by seemingly legitimate fact-checked sources.
	- LOCATION: Page 137
- “outrage porn.” The term refers to stories and headlines intentionally written in a way to pro- voke anger. It is a technique used frequently by liberal-leaning and conservative-leaning media outlets alike.
	- LOCATION: Page 138
- When the world is supposedly on fire, why waste time worrying about it until you can smell smoke? Unfortu- nately, even when that smoke arrives, there are plenty of people who suggest it’s just a smoke machine. I have referred to this state of affairs as our “modern believability crisis,” when we are unsure of whom and what to be- lieve or where to place our attention.
	- LOCATION: Page 139
- Surrounded by so much noise from brands, media outlets, and politicians vying for our attention and blurring the line between what’s real or not, we’ve become good at selectively focusing out of necessity. To do so, we are turning inward to our core beliefs and aligning ourselves with those who share them. In the process, we are also   becoming   more   closed   off   to   perspectives   that   differ   from   our   own,   a   trend   we   called   Truthing   back   in 2018. One of the effects of this introspective trend is that we are increasingly entrusting our attention to individual curators to help spotlight where we should spend our attention wealth.

- In an information economy, attention is the currency.

- Purposeful Profit
	- LOCATION: Page 146
- As consumers and employees demand more sustainable and ethical practices from businesses, companies re- spond by adapting products, taking stands on issues, and putting purpose first.
	- LOCATION: Page 146
- Two voices leading the connection between purpose, mindfulness and organizational performance are Dr. Eliza Shah and Paresh Shah, founders of Lifter Leadership. Their groundbreaking research has identified “Lifters,” an emerging segment that spans all age groups and can be trained to drive purpose, innovation, work- place health and change. Lifters are positive, purposeful workers who simultaneously uplift their co-workers, customers, communities and their company.
	- LOCATION: Page 146
- In the past, brands would limit themselves to “soft branding” of cause-related initiatives—preferring to take a quiet role as an invisible supporter rather than taking a public stand. This was once the best way for a corpo- ration to support initiatives that aligned with its core values without feeling overtly promotional.
	- LOCATION: Page 148
- Data Abundance
	- LOCATION: Page 152
- The growing ubiquity of data and the myriad ways it can be collected raise big questions about how to make it truly useful, who owns the data, and who should stand to profit from it.
	- LOCATION: Page 153
- In addition to all this data collected by organizations and information shared online by individuals, there is one other source of considerable data that is increasingly being made publicly available: “open data.” This term refers to the vast stores of data dumped online by companies and governments in the name of transparency or regulatory compliance.
	- LOCATION: Page 154	
- When it comes to data, quality is far more important than quantity
	- LOCATION: Page 158
- A   story   in   the   Washington   Post   reported   that   teenagers   are   curating   their   accounts   on   Instagram   and   deleting old photos that either did not get many likes or no longer were wanted on their profiles. But when users delete old posts, that alters their page views and engagement time stats, skewing the data that Instagram is trying to monetize. The less accurate their data, the fewer opportunities there are to sell advertising. Desperate to stop users from deleting the data its business model depends on, Instagram introduced a feature that allows users to archive their old images instead of deleting them. As we continue to generate more data, there will be growing urgency to ensure the data is in good enough shape   to   be   usable.

- In other words, having access to a treasure trove of data collected by wearable devices doesn’t necessarily translate to health providers finding meaning in it. Even patients struggle to find real value in the data beyond “feel-good stats.” The devices provide plenty of pats on the back, for example, displaying celebratory firework icons every time the user reaches an arbitrary goal, such as walking 10,000 steps in a day. The result is plenty of data collection, yet potentially little impact on long-term health or happiness from it.
	- LOCATION: Page 164
- Although we willingly trade our data, we remain concerned about how such details are used, a point I wrote about   back   in   2014   with   a   trend   we   called   Privacy   Paranoia .   Still,   the   reason   we   do   it   is   because   we   are   under   the influence   of   what   behavioral   economics   call   benefit   immediacy :   We   share   information   willingly   because   the benefits of doing so are immediate while the risks are delayed.
	- LOCATION: Page 169
- Protective Tech
	- LOCATION: Page 173
- As we increasingly rely on predictive technology that keeps us and our world safe and makes life more conve- nient, we must contend with the privacy trade-offs required to make it work.
	- LOCATION: Page 173
- The tension between the desire for smart tech to help us manage our lives—in this case, our health—and our worry that it might infringe on privacy will only grow as this tech becomes more ubiquitous. It raises a natural question: Should we cede so many health and life decisions to machines?
	- LOCATION: Page 178
- As   the   Protective   Tech   megatrend   plays   out   over   the   coming   decade,   a   generation   of   young   consumers   will   ex- pect technology to optimize every waking moment of their lives. But as they become dependent on technology to take care of the mundane tasks of adulting, will they also lose the ability to handle more nuanced parts of having human relationships and turn to technology for those as well?
	- LOCATION: Page 181
- Predictive smart technology already makes our lives more convenient and safer. But in order to provide real- time utility, these technologies have to “listen,” collecting information about us and our environment 24/7. As protective tech becomes more sophisticated, it will lead to more debates about how much of our daily lives should be trackable and how important personal privacy and individual liberties are when weighed against the broader interests of society.
	- LOCATION: Page 182
- As learning technology gets smarter, it’s evolution will largely come from watching humans and parsing the media that humans create—which leads to an unusual chal- lenge for humanity. Just as we must serve as role models for our children, increasingly we will need to serve that same role for our technology as well.

- Flux Commerce
	- LOCATION: Page 184
- As the lines between industries erode, how we sell and buy anything changes constantly, leading to a con- tinual disruption of business models, distribution channels, consumer expectations and even innovation it- self.
	- LOCATION: Page 185
- The enthusiasm around a “fad” has always been intense and viral. But fad fatigue has had a tremendous ef- fect on how we buy (or not buy) products. We are simply moving on to the next flavor of the month faster and faster. This has put companies under tremendous pressure to find new ways to innovate. They are trying to find the “next big thing” and fear that nothing less than a complete overhaul of their business will be necessary to assure their relevance and survival. It has led some of the more desperate to naively look to recreate exactly what   they   see   more   innovative   competitors   doing—a   trend   we   described   as   Innovation   Envy   in   2019.
	- LOCATION: Page 191
- Often, companies will mistake invention for innovation. They are not the same thing. This com- mon mistake can lead to shallow ideation, one-dimensional product or service ideas, and undif- ferentiated engagement with your customers. Look beyond products to consider new business models that integrate greater purpose and deliver more robust experiences that delight cus- tomers.
	- LOCATION: Page 191
- Likeonomics Brands, products, and services succeed by being more human, mission driven, and personally likeable through their policies and people, gaining an advantage over less empathetic competitors.

	- LOCATION: Page 329
- Forward-looking brands redesign their loyalty programs and try delight to inspire loyalty.
	- LOCATION: Page 333
- seeing the world in a narrow or one-dimensional way is even more damaging than a doomsday prophecy, because it often leads to people make flawed decisions today —not   just   spread   empty   dread   for   our   distant   future.
