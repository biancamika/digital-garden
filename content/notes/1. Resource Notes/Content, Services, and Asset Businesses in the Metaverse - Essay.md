## Highlights

> The Metaverse will also revolutionize categories which, for the most part, have ==avoided disruption throughout the internet era. ==Education is a great example. Technologists have long argued that in-person colleges and trade schools would be fundamentally reconfigured and displaced by remote learning. But if COVID has done anything for this movement, it has proven how truly awful Zoom-based learning and digital quizzes are, and ==how critical a sense of individual presence and rich socializing is to development.==

> Whether it’s 3D animated characters viewed through a 2D iPad screen or 360° virtual reality, the Metaverse will enable students to attend ==richly populated educational environments==, with ==full agency and autonomy==, as well as rich facial and body animations. This won’t replace the in-person experience, but it will close the gap considerably, while also helping those who suffer with social anxiety. It will also enable society to get far greater leverage on one of its most scarce and valuable resources: ==incredible teachers.==

> In addition, virtual immersive classes offer ==the ability to learn in ways that aren’t possible in any classroom — especially at underfunded schools.== And this means more than just visiting Rome in VR, which was long promised as a “killer app” for XR but turned out to be rather stale. Instead, the Metaverse will enable students to learn about the construction of Roman aqueducts by helping to build them. Rather than just reading about physics, children will build [Rube Goldberg machines](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/lesson-plans/create-a-rube-goldberg-machine-in-fortnite-creative) (on Earth, and on Mars), and construct LED screens the size of buildings. None of this requires education at a distance, but it certainly improves it. What’s more, ==schools will be designed to augment these capabilities _through_ a physical classroom.== Altogether new companies will be formed to build virtual schools and lessons, with teachers and performers hired to administer them live via motion capture.
