## Highlights
> “==I like to say we’re giving kids the tools that they need to lead successful lives in the digital age—and preparing them for the coming of the metaverse==,” said Ed Fleming, founder of a long-running [computer camp](https://www.flemingcamps.com/) based in Philadelphia. The metaverse, a term coined by science-fiction novelist Neal Stephenson, refers to an all-encompassing 3-D digital space that resembles those of today’s massive multiplayer games.

> It may seem ironic that some educators see the solution to online learning loss as more online learning, but both Fleming and his students say the experience is different. ==Game design and other technology-related topics, they say, translate well to online spaces like Zoom.==

> “I was actually surprised at how much better it was than taking school online,” she said. Since most of the classwork is in game design and related fields, ==“you can team up with other people in games and work side-by-side with them, kind of like you’re close to them.”==

> Dave Kramer, who has taught at the camp, and whose 13-year-old son Aiden attends it, said creating media, not just consuming it, was a huge motivation. The boy was eager to attend once he understood that ==“you can be the person making those videos or making those games … instead of you just watching someone playing someone’s game. That really did intrigue him.”==

consuming -> creating

> In 2018, Epic Games [released](https://www.engadget.com/2018-12-05-fortnite-is-getting-a-big-new-creative-mode.html) a ==“sandbox”== version of _Fortnite_ that allows players to modify the game’s features and create their own “islands,” mini-games, and other assets.

> Isaacs, a serial education entrepreneur who has also produced content for [Minefaire](https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/minefaire-oaks), a massive Minecraft “fan experience,” saw an opportunity for educators. Last year, after more than two decades in the classroom, he retired and now leads a [team at Epic](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/calling-all-teachers-take-part-in-hour-of-code-with-epic-games?fbclid=IwAR11lzTbxT1mcWcje0VZ8x3RFrg5DQDlxMnjqqNMEfcEy7nq2SquVKzrNPc) that runs boot camps that train teachers on how to use Fortnite and its underlying engine for learning.
