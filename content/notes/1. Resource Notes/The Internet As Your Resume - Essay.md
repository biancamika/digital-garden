## Highlights
Graduating from a university means that you spent X amounts of money––to solve Y number of problems––for 1 credential. School is there to prove that:
-   We’re capable individuals who are responsible members of society
-   We can finish what we start

Those are two ideal traits employers look for in new graduates, yet those incentives no longer apply; see wage stagnation and unemployment

The most indebted generation in history is ==without the dependable jobs it needs to escape debt==


### Social Capital is Online Reputation
+ The internet today is outdated and incentivizes us to assume reputation rather than justify it.
+ Reputation is [capital](https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2019/2/19/status-as-a-service)
	+ "Social capital is, in many ways, a leading indicator of financial capital, and so its nature bears greater scrutiny"
+ Social capital is internet reputation. By building an online audience, you become more reputable to people.
	+ E.G. building a portfolio, producing vlogs, educating people, commisioning paintings
+ In short:
	+ **Reputation** is justified based on what you do online and in real life
	+  **Social capital** is achieved based on how well you use the internet

### The Web3 Experiment: A Decentralized Internet
#### Web2 Problems
1. **The server problem**
	1. Centralized infrastructure
2. **Host-based addressing model**
	1. lack of interoperability

#### Web3 Solutions
1. **Blockchains**
	1. Blockchains solve the central server issue by letting users collectively validate the information. There’s no need for a single entity authorizing every user transaction.
2. **Merkle trees**
	1. prove media authenticity
	2. content is transferrable since it's all addressed in one network
### Onchain = Internet Resumes
> Chris Dixon describes blockchains as =="special computers that anyone can access but no one owns".==
+ content owned by users rather than platforms
+ changes the incentives to create by letting users earn ==royalties== rather than money. 
+ Not only can users earn equity, but they can logically ==prove social capital== through their content

#### Crypto wallets are passports to Web3
Anyone who has your public key can do things like:
+   Review your [on-chain activity](https://etherscan.io/txs)
+   Consume content you’ve [published](https://etherscan.io/enslookup-search?search=rushil.eth)
+   Send crypto directly to your [wallet](https://www.coincenter.org/donate/)
+   See what [investments](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0BC3807Ec262cB779b38D65b38158acC3bfedE10) you’ve made
+   View your [NFT collection](https://www.egirlcapital.com/collectibles)

> On-chain transactions get triggered every time users interact with the network. Since the activities are public, you can reveal evidence of what you’ve done, and when. That’s what employers look for when hiring potential candidates. ==Judgment, skills, and participation are all demonstrated through your crypto wallets. It’s like a dynamic resume that upgrades based on how well you use the internet.==

> Wallets are the next social networks

>==Crypto-wallets are a passport to web 3 applications.== Every time you participate on a platform, your public key gets stamped on a blockchain and tracked by merkle trees. This proves how actively you produce online. Whether it’s through internet consumption, curation, publication, or investing — your web 3 passport will prove your online travels:

> A difference between reputation on web 2 and web 3: **Social capital on-chain would be justified, not assumed.**

### Earning Crypto Credentials
> In the crypto world, ==media can be rewarded as a form of social capital.== NFTs can be encrypted as a qualification like degrees, diplomas, certificates, or badges to participants. As more applications scale to use NFTs, people may earn a reputation like online bounty hunters, based on their on-chain activities:

### Closing Thoughts
With the scaling of blockchains, merkle trees, NFTs, and on-chain analytics, we now know that:
-   People can display ==proof of reputation== based on how well they use the internet
-   Skills can logically be measured through ==crypto wallets, public, and private keys tracked on-chain==
-   Creative work will progress as verification and authentication are automated
