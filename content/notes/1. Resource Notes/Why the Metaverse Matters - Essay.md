## Highlights
### What is the Metaverse and why does it matter?
+ it will create ==meaningful human connection== and ==unprecedented access to opportunity,== no matter where you are.
+ Traditionally, physical location has dictated how we live.
+ The Metaverse solves this problem: it's the next iteration of the Internet that brings a ==sense of place== and ==facilitates rich human connection.==
+ **This is what the Metaverse means to us.** The Metaverse is about how people interact with each other and the spaces they create. It's a virtual layer that gives a sense of place, and connects people across many different contexts. Ultimately, it will change the way we think about physical location, and create opportunity and connection for people, no matter where they are.

### Building the Metaverse correctly
+ The Metaverse was not missing R&D or a protocolâ€”it was ==missing products and platforms that would provide concrete value to people.== To achieve this, we'd need a lot of resources.
+ Values essential for building the best possible Metaverse:
	+ **Our North Star is the collective, positive impact of the broader Metaverse**.
		+ "Collective impact"
			+ we don't only optimize for the impact we create, but also the ==impact created by the broader ecosystem== of organizations and creators working towards the Metaverse. 
			+ We care less about what fraction of the pie we capture, and instead focus on making the pie as large as possible.
		+ we seek to ==collaborate== with mission-aligned organizations to push forward the broader Metaverse.
	+ **The Metaverse should be open and decentralized.**
		+ anyone should be able to innovate
		+ too important to be controlled by a singular central authority
		+ we need ==many entities== to build and govern the Metaverse, representing the diverse population it will serve
	+ **Align our incentives for the good of our users.**
		+ done through business models and mechanism design
		+ the best way to prevent bad outcomes is to ==remove them as options entirely==
