## Highlights
### Web3's Shared Challenge: Growing Our Own Timber
*We need to develop a system that onboards people to Web3 in meaningful ways enabling them to contribute as their best selves while forging their own narratives.*
+ Concerns
	+ talent gap
	+ adoption gap
	+ super fast pace of innovation

### Education Must Become a Public Good
*Education is historically not scalable because it ultimately relies on teacher-to-student ratios and limted class sizes, limiting it to being a merit good. However, this could be changed with Web3, as activities can become publicly accessible and participatory.*
+ education is a merit good
	+ positive externalities when consumed
	+ tend to be underconsumed and underprovided
+ negative examples:
	+ endless advertisements on trading 
	+ biased education efforts where the focus is on users to become motivated to trade
+ Core characteristics of public goods
	+ non-rivalrous: accessible to everybody; one person's use of the good does not impact its availability to others
	+ non-excludable: it should be impossible to exclude anybbody from using the good
+ Current web3 educational content does not fulfill these
	+ rivalrous
	+ excludable

### Develop Positive Externalities
*We can carry out activities that create benefits for parties that were not directly involved by making Web3's resources understandable, searchable, and accessible.*

+ Making a metaDAO to coordinate these efforts
+ What can be done...
	+ Make Web3 resources understandable
	+ Make Web3 resources searchable
	+ Create accessible Web3 resources
	+ Create benefits with talent-matching

### Incentivise Collective Support
*If governments have budgets for education and corporations ahve training budgets, why not DAOs?*

+ Improve incentives for participation
	+ dKudos, mini CLR
	+ participation as anti-fraud
	+ encouraging curriculum and content designers to post their work as NFTs, so that they can obtain royalties when content is licensed
+ Grant funding gap
+ Demonstrate collective benefit of education
	+ develop a framework to evaluate impact
+ Make teh DAO generate reveneue for sustainability

### Conclusion
Web3 enables us to ==tweak incentives== to make education a ==sustainable digital public good== for the first time in human history through ==decentralized credentials and coordination==
