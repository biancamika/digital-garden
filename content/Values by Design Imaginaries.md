## Highlights
- Primary data collected from: qualitative interviews with UX professionals and field observations at UX meetup events
	- Second, designers’ professional practices, including their values-related practices, extend beyond the individual workplace. Some of these practices include sharing stories and resources at local “meetup” events, or sharing and learning about resources in online settings. These networked practices across sites suggests looking for entry points into these networks, rather than searching for a particular bounded location (Burrell 2009). This led me to conduct interviews with UX professionals and conduct observations at meetup events where UX professionals from different organizations come together to meet each other and learn from each other.
- Design workbooks - imagine a website version of this? Something interactive
