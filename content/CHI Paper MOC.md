title: "CHI Paper MOC"
---
## Overview
- Basically like my thesis (See [[Thesis MOC]]) but with a different methodology
	- Thesis: researches creates AI art 
	- CHI Paper: participants create AI art
- Goal: Full paper submission to CHI 25? and/or WIP paper submission to CHI 24

## Ideas
- Workshop where participants create AI art based on the following prompt: "Imagine a day in the life in 2040 for the Filipino"?
- Must come with education beforehand (e.g. how to write good prompts)
- maybe involve not just AI art, but AI writing as well?

## Questions
- Logistics of running a workshop or a sprint, especially in a remote setting
