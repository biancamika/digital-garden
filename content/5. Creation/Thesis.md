## Thesis
### Advisor Notes
#### 9/12/22
##### Feedback
1. Title: Currently, does not define or hint what "Collaboratively Imagining" would entail. Consider a more effective title for a future version. Also, promises a collaboration.
2. How is Afrofuturism constructed? What are its foundations? 
3. Questions of curation and power of curating. 
4. Collaboration would entail human participants. 
5. Questions of how it becomes Filipino Futurism. 
6. Collective worldbuilding: see Relational Aesthetics. Questions of tension between "collective national dream" and propaganda/ideology.

**Instructions:**
1. Formulate your questions/objectives soon. 
2. Decide what specific frameworks to use.
