#BIO21i 
## Concept Paper + Pitch
### Instructions
- Write a 2-6 page proposal paper for **your own original biological _novum_** that you wish to feature in your final project, as well as the **form** the project will take: the **mode, platform, or genre** with which you want to showcase your _novum_.
- The _novum_ has to be biological, and you should discuss it briefly in terms of **Suvin's concepts (i.e. how it displays [[Permanent Notes/Cognition]] and [[Permanent Notes/Estrangement]])** as well as the **framework of a sign (i.e. what scientific ideas and science fiction tropes it uses as signifiers, what socio-cultural concepts and/or experiences it signifies, and how these elements interact in the final _novum_)**.
- We suggest beginning with a simple formulation to ground your proposal: something like **"My project will focus on a [_novum_] that uses [biological concept/s] as signifiers to stand for [social/cultural idea/s] as signified."** 
	- If you're proposing multiple _nova_ at this stage (perhaps to get our feedback on which one/s we think might be viable), do one for each one you're proposing. 
	- For example, the writers behind _The Last of Us_ might say, "My project will focus on a zombie outbreak that uses the ant-zombifying cordyceps fungus as a signifier and uses it to stand for ruthless, inhuman survivalism in a crisis as the signified."
- When you tell us what form/s you're considering, please also walk us through how you imagine the project working or progressing: if it's a narrative work, walk us through the story and how the plot will engage and reveal the _novum_; if it's a piece of visual art, tell us how you'll produce it and how that will showcase the _novum_ you're working on.
- It would help to think about how the _novum_ and the form of the project will interact. 
	- If you're working on a disease _novum_, for example, or a creature with multiple stages in its life cycle, you might want to choose a form that allows you to highlight progression, like a short story or an audio drama. 
	- If you've got a flair for art or design, you might want to make a _novum_ that's visually arresting and cool to look at. That sort of thing. This should be a coherent project, which means form and content interacting well with each other.

### Writing
#### Version 1
##### Weight Loss Pills
My project will focus on weight loss pills that uses genetically engineered parasites as signifiers. They will be used to signify misinformation-fuelled diet culture and its victims: people who will resort to desparate measures just to get their desired bodies.

One inspiration behind this *novum* is my mother, who happens to be one of these people. Being overweight is one of her greatest insecurities. Rather than committing to sustainable healthy habits, what she'd often do instead is buy all the popular diet powders, teas, pills, etc. She'd even offer these to me as well, knowing that I also want to lose weight. Whenever I'd question her on the effectiveness of these products, she'd never be able to defend them properly (she'd always gain the weight she initially lost from trying them); however, even after being reminded of their unreliability, she'd still continue buying them. Thus, I can't help but recognize this kind of cognitive dissonance whenever I see a popular diet supplement.

Another inspiration is the dangerous tapeworm diet. I find it disturbing how people — particularly women — have been purposefully infecting themselves for years (even since the [Victorian era](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/the-horrifying-legacy-of-the-victorian-tapeworm-diet)) despite all the unpleasant side effects. Aside from tapeworms, I am also considering the giardia parasite as the signifier. Here is an interesting excerpt from Schrage's ["High-Tech Tapeworms Could Be the Diet Fad of the Next Century"](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1991-09-19-fi-3549-story.html): 

>Actually, it turns out that tapeworms are probably the wrong parasite for weight management. “There’s a lot of mythology surrounding tapeworms,” says Dickson Despommier, a Columbia University professor of public health and microbiology. “They don’t really induce weight loss; they don’t eat enough to compete with our digestive systems for food.”
>
>However, Despommier points to _giardia lamblia_ as a parasite with potential. A protozoa (basically, a flagellate with an attitude) that’s responsible for creating particularly nasty cases of diarrhea, giardia does have one fascinating property: It generates a chemical that prevents the human digestive system from absorbing animal fat.
>
>The trick, says Despommier, would be to figure out giardia’s active ingredient and synthesize it. “That would be outstanding,” he says. “If you could find out from giardia what its molecular secret was to prevent the absorption of animal fat . . . it’s a straightforward logical extension for the biology of this organism.”
>
>Theoretically, you could create “anti-fat” pills from this agent or even cultivate specially bred bowel colonies of giardia that block the fat without generating the runs. It’s not clear if pharmaceutical companies have begun to explore this parasite’s potential--but there’s no question that such research would be both technically feasible and possibly enormously profitable.

Consuming parasites already makes weight loss terrifying and bizarre, but it's still too close to reality (unfortunately). Genetically engineering parasites to become symbionts would bring weight loss pills into the realm of the unreal. However, I worry that removing all the negative side-effects of infections would diminish the *novum*'s signified. To tackle this, I'm considering making zombification the pills' main consequence (similar to [Mira Grant's *Parasitology* series](https://www.goodreads.com/series/99015-parasitology)). Perhaps taking these pills would turn wannabe dieters into perpertual salespeople; their living days would be fully consumed by trying to market these pills to others (Yes, I'm cracking down on MLMs. Looking at you, USANA!).

For the form of this project, I want to make a website for promoting the fictional weight loss pills. This would feature the benefits of these pills, results from clinical trials, and success stories shared by customers. These main parts (along with other sections like FAQ and Disclaimer) will be used to showcase the *novum*.  I am still debating whether I want to make this website look professional, or as scammy as possible (through dark marketing tactics).

##### Mail-to-order Partners
My project will focus on artificially made mail-to-order brides/husbands. Human reproductive cloning and genetic engineering are used as signifiers to stand for the commodification of life and love, along with the unequal power dynamic behind many transnational relationships.

The main inspiration behind this *novum* is [Yvette Tan's "Seek Ye Whore"](https://web.archive.org/web/20220811151400/https://yvettetan.com/2019/02/11/seek-ye-whore/), which features siquijorbrides.com: a fictional website for inhuman mail-to-order brides. The protagonist, a middle-aged American male, orders one to use as a servant and blow-up doll, and ends up getting more than what he wished for. While reading this story, I was reminded of how acquiring this kind of relationship is so easy nowadays; technology (the Internet) mediates it, media (*90 Day Fiance*) promotes it, and culture (colonial mentality) sustains it. Aside from this, I also find inspiration in  AI humans like [Star Labs' NEONs](https://neonlife.ai/) and [Replika's companions](https://replika.com/). I'm intrigued by technologies behind these creations and people are reacting to them. A notable example: Replika's recent shutting down of its erotic roleplay functionality left much of its community devastated, to the point that [many of its members were sharing suicide prevention resources](https://knowyourmeme.com/news/replika-ai-shuts-down-erotic-role-play-community-shares-suicide-prevention-resources). Putting these two inspirations together, I can't help but think about how  dehumanization seems utterly inescapable in a capitalist system; even non-human species like monsters and robots don't seem to have a chance. What better way of reflecting this truth than the production of humans for the sake of "marriage"?

Thus, this project will be centered on a biotech company making and selling such humans, aiming to provide everyone in the world (who can afford it) the perfect match. However, since perfection is contextually dependent, the company will be providing a variety of humans to choose from. The only characteristic shared by all the models would be their physically optimal condition (i.e. youthful and healthy, high libido). A particular question I'd like to explore (inspired by Ted Chiang's "The Lifecycle of Software Objects") is the personality expression of an artificially made human: if a person purchases their dream partner, would this partner come with a personality or not? While I think the buyer would be able to dictate certain inclinations (e.g. less aggressive, more social), I believe that the partner's personality would develop further when they're already in contact with the buyer.  

For the form of this project, I will make a website for  selling these mail-to-order partners. The design of this will be based off existing dating websites, where potential partners can be filtered by physical characteristics (e.g. age, ethnicity, height and weight, hair and eye color, body type, etc.). If a user doesn't find anything they like from the ready-made selection, they can choose to order their own. The made-to-order page will allow a user to choose the physical characteristics they'd want for their partner. The website will also contain pages (such as "Learn More" and "FAQ") that dive deep into the production process of these partners. I'm planning to use AI-generated art for the visuals of these partners in order to make them look both perfect and uncanny.

##### Influencer Hivemind
My project will focus on a human hivemind consisting of content creators that uses eusociality, nanotechnology, and the group mind as signifiers to signify the exploitative nature of the social media industry — for both influencers and their audiences.

For the form of this project, I will write an exposé that also serves as an interactive article (similar to [the Guidon's interactives](https://interactive.theguidon.com/)).

##### Writing
My project will focus on weight-loss shakes that involve genetically engineered tapeworms as signifiers. They will be used to signify misinformation-fuelled diet culture and its victims: people who will resort to desparate measures just to get their desired bodies.

**On the Novum**
In a world saturated with diet products, Shapeshifters Co.'s Trim Tonic™  weight-loss shake is the latest gamechanger, reknown for its unprecedented efficiency and effectiveness. Instead of following a routine for 7 or 30 days...all you have to do is drink this once, and let it do its magic! Over the span of a month, your metabolism will drastically increase in speed, making burning fat as easy as pie. This change comes with no harmful side-effects (unlike most laxatives), and it will remain long-term for sure. Forget about exercise programs and meal plans; all you need is one drink to change your life. It costs just $200 — a bargain price for a worthy investment.

Marketing voice aside, the secret ingredient behind this powerful shake is its special tapeworms. Each ready-made shake comes with its own eggs. Once these are consumed, they go to the consumer's intestines; here, they hatch and develop in adults over the course of 3 weeks (a sped-up growth rate thanks to genetic engineering). They then attach themselves to the intenstinal walls  in order to start absorbing nutrients from food digestion. This is when the consumer will start experiencing rapid weight loss. 

Besides the intestines, the tapeworms are also designed to migrate and attach themselves to the brain. These would then influence the consumer to become an avid network marketer for the company: buying, promoting, and selling the shakes so that more people would try them out. The company, Shapeshifters Co., altered the tapeworms this way in order to use them as a growth strategy; why spend millions on influencer marketing when you can make your customers do it for free? All the aforementioned behaviors are also advantageous for the tapeworms (in a reproductive perspective), so they encourage these by hijacking the brain's reward system (a.k.a. the mesocorticolimbic circuit). Pleasure is experienced everytime a sale is made, and motivation is high for relevant activities like finding leads. 

However, this modified system can also turn on the consumer; if they aren't succeeding with sales for a certain period of time, they can experience withdrawal-like symptoms such as irritability, depression, and anxiety. These effects on mental health are further exacerbated by the consumer's infected intestines, given that [the gut and the brain are intimately connected](https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/the-gut-brain-connection). When it comes to real-life multi-level marketing, [many people trapped in the system feel addicted to it](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiMLM/comments/8kg5gj/mlm_and_addiction/); thus, I thought it would brain-hijacking parasites would be a good signifier for this.

Despite their secret, Shapeshifters Co. is able to make these shakes without problems. The Food and Drug administration (FDA) [does not have the authority to approve dietary supplements (for their safety and effectiveness, and/or for their labelling) before they are marketed](https://www.fda.gov/food/information-consumers-using-dietary-supplements/questions-and-answers-dietary-supplements). It is the company that is responsible for ensuring that their supplements meet safety standards. However, the FDA still plays a role in regulating these supplements (e.g. inspecting manafacturing facilities, reviewing product labels, monitoring adverse reports). To ensure secrecy, Shapeshifters Co. utilizes genetic engineering techniques to make the tapeworms difficult to detect using traditional testing methods. Aside from this, the product's label hides this from the ingredient list (which is already difficult to read). Misleading health claims and testimonials are also used to make the product look legitimate (thanks ChatGPT for the suggestions).

- Possible names:
	- Trim Tonic
	- Lean & Mean


**On the Form**
This project will consist of two components: a website that promotes the fictional weight loss shakes, and an article that aims to expose the shakes' secrets.

The website will feature the benefits of these shakes, results from clinical trials, and success stories shared by customers. These main parts (along with other sections like FAQ and Disclaimer) will be used to showcase the _novum_. Along with the website, I will be designing the label of the product, along with possible advertisements. For this, I think I will be taking inspiration from  the designs of "gym bro" supplements, "natural" detox products, and vintage tapeworm diet advertisements.

The article will serve to show the progressive stages of the parasite. It will be a post published on a fake r/conspiracytheories; I'll recreate a single page of the subreddit through design and code. This post will include a link to the Shapeshifters website, connecting both of this project's components as one interactive experience. The story will start with background context on the product's popularity, showing screenshots of Instagram posts and Tiktok videos from fictional influencers. Then, this will segue to the writer's mother, who tried out the shake for herself. The author then witnesses her mother become a whole new person. At first, she experiences rapid weight loss and is raving all about it. However, she also starts having an obsessive personality; all she cares about now is sharing the shakes everywhere. Concerned, she acquires a shake from her mother just to investigate it herself, being a medical school student. She is then shocked to find tapeworm eggs inside (To be honest, tapeworm eggs look a lot like rice grains...and rice shakes exist so...). Aware that her mother wouldn't believe her (she wasn't open to criticism at all), the author resorts to desparate measures by sneaking antiparasitic medication in her mother's food. While this sends the mother to the bathrooom (and keeps her stuck there), her mind is still on hyper-salesperson mode. Lost, the author asks the subreddit for help, unsure of what to do next. I'd imagine the comments are filled with people confirming the effects of the shakes, along with those theorizing what they do.

- Context
	- GMOs are all the hype now. From engineered food -> engineered supplements
- Product Manual: taking care and marketing ur tapeworm
	- make sure to eat enough! (to sustain ur worm)
- Honestly I think you're dead-on in that spotlighting the tapeworms rather than hiding them might be a more interesting direction. It arguably makes the fight against marketing and disinformation harder if there isn't a super obvious lie. If that's the direction you take, ==figure out what's being hidden, what's not being hidden, and what's actively being marketed.==
	- What's hidden: the mind control
	- What's not being hidden: the presence of tapeworms
	- What's actively being marketed: the fat-burning potential
- should the video be like...reality tv show snippet....or health influencer vlog?
- similar to *Microbiota and the Masses*...everyone has their own microbiota? or organism in their body? or at least doing something for them

		- Human alcohol targets (of which there many) are molecular channels that bind alcohol in the body, triggering the whole spectrum of drunken behaviour.
		- "Our findings provide exciting evidence that future pharmaceuticals might aim at this portion of the alcohol target to prevent problems in alcohol abuse disorders," says Pierce-Shimomura. "However, it remains to be seen which aspects of these disorders would benefit."
		- The researchers even speculated that one day they might be able to develop a “James Bond” drug that would enable spies to drink without becoming intoxicated - although its use outside of spycraft would be uncertain; if drinkers couldn't feel the effects of alcohol they might never stop.

		- "You can introduce a foreign gene into an organism's genome, or you can knock out a gene using this technology and colleagues of ours in the US have recently applied this to parasitic worms," he said.

### AI Research
- One possible way that this future could end up happening is by imagining a scenario where ==genetic engineering becomes more advanced and accessible==, and people start to modify not only plants and animals, but also themselves and their children. You could explore the ethical, social, and environmental implications of such a world, as well as the potential conflicts and challenges that might arise from it. For example, you could ask questions like:
	- How would people’s identities and relationships change if they could alter their appearance, abilities, or personality traits?
	- What would be the benefits and risks of creating new species or hybrids of existing ones?
	-   How would the natural ecosystems and biodiversity be affected by the introduction of GMOs?
	-   What would be the legal and political issues involved in regulating GMOs and protecting human rights?
	-   How would different cultures and religions react to GMOs and their creators?
	-   What would be the role of science and technology in this society?
- There are different factors that could influence the popularity of GMOs in the future, such as:
	- The **demand** for food: As the world population grows and urbanizes, the demand for food will increase, especially for animal products and processed foods. [GMOs could help meet this demand by increasing crop yields, enhancing nutritional quality, and reducing food waste](https://www.statista.com/topics/2062/genetically-modified-crops/)[1](https://www.statista.com/topics/2062/genetically-modified-crops/)[2](https://www.fda.gov/food/agricultural-biotechnology/how-gmo-crops-impact-our-world)
	- The **environmental** challenges: Climate change, water scarcity, soil degradation, and biodiversity loss are some of the environmental challenges that threaten food security and sustainability. [GMOs could help address these challenges by improving crop resilience to stress, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and conserving natural resources](https://www.statista.com/topics/2062/genetically-modified-crops/)[1](https://www.statista.com/topics/2062/genetically-modified-crops/)[2](https://www.fda.gov/food/agricultural-biotechnology/how-gmo-crops-impact-our-world)[3](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/the-future-of-eating-gm-crops.html)
	- The **innovation** in biotechnology: Advances in biotechnology could enable the development of new and improved GMOs that offer more benefits and fewer risks. [For example, gene editing techniques such as CRISPR-Cas9 could allow more precise and targeted modifications of crops, animals, and microorganisms](https://www.statista.com/topics/2062/genetically-modified-crops/)[1](https://www.statista.com/topics/2062/genetically-modified-crops/)[2](https://www.fda.gov/food/agricultural-biotechnology/how-gmo-crops-impact-our-world)
	- The **regulation** of GMOs: The regulation of GMOs varies widely across countries and regions, depending on their policies, laws, and public opinions. Some countries have strict regulations that limit or ban the cultivation and consumption of GMOs, while others have more lenient or supportive regulations that encourage or facilitate their use. [The regulation of GMOs could affect their availability, affordability, and acceptance in the future](https://www.statista.com/topics/2062/genetically-modified-crops/)[1](https://www.statista.com/topics/2062/genetically-modified-crops/)[2](https://www.fda.gov/food/agricultural-biotechnology/how-gmo-crops-impact-our-world)
	- The **perception** of GMOs: The perception of GMOs among consumers, farmers, and other stakeholders is influenced by various factors, such as their knowledge, beliefs, values, and emotions. Some people have positive perceptions of GMOs and see them as beneficial and safe, while others have negative perceptions and see them as harmful and risky. [The perception of GMOs could affect their adoption, consumption, and advocacy in the future](https://www.statista.com/topics/2062/genetically-modified-crops/)[1](https://www.statista.com/topics/2062/genetically-modified-crops/)[2](https://www.fda.gov/food/agricultural-biotechnology/how-gmo-crops-impact-our-world)
- Some people may prefer to avoid GMO supplements for various reasons, such as health concerns, environmental issues, or ethical values. ==However, there is no conclusive evidence that GMO supplements are harmful or unsafe for human consumption==. [The FDA, EPA, and USDA maintain that GMOs are safe and regulated](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/gmo-pros-and-cons)[2](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/gmo-pros-and-cons)
