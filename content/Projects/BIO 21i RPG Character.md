#BIO21i 
## Guidelines
- _**Origins of Life and** **Species**_: 
	- Tell us about **at least one unique** **milestone in the evolution** of your species from its ancestors. 
		- The first step is to identify and describe an ancestral species. It doesn't have to be the direct ancestor; you can establish that the available fossil records do not reveal what that direct ancestor is! 
		- From that ancestor, what is at least one major evolutionary change that resulted in your character's species? How are these changes reflected in the species' in-game traits?
	- Additionally, talk a little about **how (and whether) these milestones inform your species' culture.** How do they perceive and respond to their ancestry?
- **_Biological Processes_**: Pick one of two:
	- Tell us about **a species that causes disease in or parasitizes on** your species. Talk about the evolutionary arms race between the two species. Is this evolutionary relationship reflected in any way in the species' in-game traits? How has your species' society learned to deal with this relationship?
	- Tell us about your species' societal and cultural concepts of **gender and sex**, if any. Is this reflected in any way by their biology, and what are the implications for how they mate and how their culture views reproduction?
- **_Biology and_** _**Society**_:
	- Design a **biotechnology-based enhancement** that your species uses and/or that your character would be interested in obtaining. Give it a name, describe what it does (not required, but if you can use D&D game terms in terms of its effects, that would be cool), and tell us how easy or difficult it would be to obtain (i.e. in terms of general accessibility--is it out in the open market or is it more of a black market thing?--and cost). Talk a bit about **how this enhancement interacts with your character's physiology as well as its value in their society and culture.**
- _**Ecology and Worldbuilding**_:
	- Tell us about **the world that you character and their species call home**. Describe some important details about the planet before focusing on your character's (or the species') **home environment**. Describe that environment's climate, major flora and fauna, and other interesting ecological features. Make sure that these are consistent with the traits of your species! Additionally, talk about **how this has influenced your species' culture and society**, keeping in mind what we know about them so far.

			- The concept for the imagery came from a dear educator I met from UP College of Fine Arts who said that Filipinos are the cockroaches of the world due to our ability to adapt to other lands and external pressure. He said this with utmost respect and love for our countrymen. And given the weight of this article, it is the best time to shed light on possible issues that could come from our go-getter attitude (see: martyrdom) to prove ourselves worthy of the opportunities we have, despite these being exploitative and inhumane.
			- _I hired Town, a nonbinary Filipino artist, because I knew that this piece on OFWs needs an authentic Filipino voice to illustrate it. I was a little surprised when they proposed the concept of the illustrations: cockroaches! But once they told me their rationale, it made so much sense. I think it was a stroke of genius, if a little unusual: In one fell swoop, the imagery portrays resilience as well as the racism that OFWs often experience abroad, as they are looked down upon by everyone but nonetheless persist in any situation. I’m quite aware of the mockery that foreign domestic workers face, and I think having a Filipino artist reclaim the imagery of cockroaches speaks plenty to the agency of Filipinos in this complex phenomenon we are portraying._

			- If we're sticking with official playable races (so Thri-Kreen is out), it would be a toss-up between a Warforged (hard natural armour, resistance to disease and poison), or a Simic Hybrid (and have them take cockroach-ish features like Carapace, Nimble Climber and Grappling Appendages). Probably the latter, I'd say.

Or, if there's an earthquake and a building crashes, Liang says, deploy them to the second floor for search and rescue, "so when they reach there, they can work as a vehicle. If they can carry any sensors, cameras, they can collect information for us."

## Writing
### Dump
- Origins of Life and Species:
	- AD 3XXX: The increasing inhospitality of the Earth pushes humanity to scout and terraform planets for future habitation. Despite its necessity, the nature of space exploration renders this scouting mission lifelong, isolating, and possibly deadly. Thus, most of the people who enlist are criminals sentenced with life imprisonment/death row, along with desparate people who want to pay off massive debts for their families. 
	- Accouting for space's extremely harsh conditions (e.g. radiation, negative temperatures), humans  experiment with integrating cockroach DNA into these scouts' bodies. These turn them  into human-cockroach hybrids.  ==Talk more about in-game traits they gained==
	- ^ They were acclaimed as heroes....
	- This initial batch of scouts gave rise to the Blattodeans, who now  proliferate the galaxy centuries later. In the societies they inhabit, they typically act as scavengers and salvagers. Considered an "untouchable" race, they are looked down upon by other species. 
	- Together, Blattodeans make up tight-knit communities. Large families (including grandparents, aunts/uncles, and cousins) are packed together in single households. They also don't have their own leaders, since everyone sees each other as equals; whenever a decision needs to be made (e.g. choosing where to forage or make nests), it is done collectively. Being social is essential to their survival; Blattodeans who grow up alone end up physically and emotionally stunted.
- Biological Processes:
	- The main differentiator between male and female Blattodeans are their wings. The males' wings span their full body length, while the females' wings are only half this size; thus, only the former is able to fly. This dictates their typical functions. Males take on jobs that require a lot of mobility (e.g. scouting for food), leaving females with the jobs that don't require as much movement (e.g. caretaking). This is also reflected in their mating process; males are the ones who actively search for partners, while females just have to choose.
	- Mate with sugar
- Biology and Society: 
	- When the first batch of Blattodeans were sent out into space, they were provided   specially-made Space Suits that would allow them to survive in unterraformed planets. First, these regulate body temperatures so that they can bear extreme heat or cold. Second, these provide limited supplies of oxygen and water. Finally, they come with dual sensory communication systems; audio technology enables them to relay sounds, while olfactory technology enables them to transmit pheromones. These systems allowed them to commmunicate not only with each other, but also an external mission control team. 
	- What also differentiates these Space Suits from normal ones is that they're ultra-light; they were sculpted for Blattodean morphology so that they wouldn't hinder mobility. 
	- However, one lesser known feature of these suits is that they came with a remote-control mechanism. This ensured that the Blattodeans would not step out of line. Whenever a scout was misbehaving, control of their suit was taken from them. 
		- Inspired by cockroach backpacks
	- Significant progress over time (i.e. extensive evolution of the Blattodeans; increasing number of terraformed planets) has diminished the need for these Space Suits. Most Blattodeans would not be able to experience wearing one due to a lack of necessity and/or capability to travel outside of their home planet.
	- Now, the primary value these Suits would offer would be as historical artifacts -- concrete reminders of the early days of space exploration.
- Ecology and Worldbuilding:
	- Blattodeans do not have a home planet, being scattered all over the galaxy. They prefer planets with tropical climates (either wet or monsoon) due to their biology. One reason is that they can only go one week without water, which requires them to live in humid or high-moisture environments. Another reason is that they are cold-blooded, which bar them from thriving in extremely hot or cold temperatures.
	- They are most likely to be found in settlements like cities, towns, and villages — anywhere trash is produced.  Some Blattodean populations can also be seen in the wild, living in forests and caves.
	- They have flexible diets, which adapt to their environments. Blattodeans in urban areas typically consume processed foods, while those in the wild eat fallen fruit, decaying plants, and small carcasses.
	- No matter where they stay, Blattodeans play an essential role in the ecosystem. Without their scavenging, places would be quickly consumed by tons of rotting food, trash, sewage and junk.
