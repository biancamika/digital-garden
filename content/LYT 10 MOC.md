## Curriculum    
### Unit 1: **Enter the age of the linked note**
***Enter the age of the linked note.*** Unit 1 sets the scene of Personal Knowledge Management.

-   We will explore the transition from only using folders, to systems that allow for robust linking.
-   We will identify how note-taking practices fail us, and how note-*making* is needed.
-   We will define how to make relationships between notes.
-  We will reflect on our PKM personality and what that means for our PKM goals and use cases.

### Units 2 & 3: **Growing Value & Accelerating Ideas**
We have two overlapping units: **_Growing Value & Accelerating Ideas_**

#### Unit 2 explores where **value** comes from and how to create more.
- We will consider the phases of PKM and the compound effects of your PKM habits.
- We will explore types of notes and how they grow in value.
- We will get hands-on reps in **note-making**.
- We will identify **fluid thinking** as the meta-skill of link-based thinking.
