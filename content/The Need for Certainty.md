## Notes
In this reading taken fromÂ _Help My Unbelief_, O'Malley challenges our human impulse towards certainty and shows how faith can flourish precisely without claiming that one has absolute certitude.

### Reflection Questions
-   Why did O'Malley call faith a "calculated risk"?
-   Why did O'Malley talk about paradoxes?
-   Why is the relevance of O'Malley's discussion about left-brain and right-brain thinking?
