John Dewey  prominent philosopher & educational thinker has covered art, politics, epistemology, and education  Democracy in education  believed in the ==role of democracy== and the importance of creating classrooms that reflect democratic values so that children would learn to ==function in the greater democratic society== they were expected to be a part of Thought that education should:  prepare people for a life of curiosity and inquiry allow people to grow their knowledge using science and to become more aware of the societal problems enable people to take initiatives to execute upon problems   pointed out that ==a democratic society is continually changing==—sometimes for the better, sometimes for the worse—and it requires citizens who are willing to participate and competent enough to distinguish between the better and the worse."><title>Learning to earn vs. learning to learn - Literature Notes</title><meta name=viewport content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1"><link rel="shortcut icon" type=image/png href=https://garden.bianca.digital//icon.png><link href=https://garden.bianca.digital/styles.b32a5c8b3128396c9b0a2bade5448bf8.min.css rel=stylesheet><link href=https://garden.bianca.digital/styles/_light_syntax.86a48a52faebeaaf42158b72922b1c90.min.css rel=stylesheet id=theme-link><script src=https://garden.bianca.digital/js/darkmode.5496a335cf0989288c53ef7012022b93.min.js></script>

He explains that a significant proportion of students require financial aid, with each one reducing the institution’s overall revenue. When a private company is paying the tab, however, the university is able to collect on the full cost.</p><p>“The mission of the institution is not to create employees for a specific company with a narrow set of skills that only that company can use; that would violate the mission of the undergraduate experience,” he says. “In fact, about 40% of engineers end up not working in engineering 10, 15 years after they graduate, so that would be a big concern.”</p><p>“The student is made to feel committed to the program rather than have an open mind, because the tuition dollars will stop if they want to switch majors,” he says. “That’s why we would not do that. We would say ‘pay us a certain amount to be on the steering committee, be a member of a consortium of companies.’ And then we know we’re preparing students for a variety of corporate pathways, not just one.”</p></blockquote><a href=#microcredentials-and-universities><h3 id=microcredentials-and-universities><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Microcredentials and universities</h3></a><ul><li><strong>Microcredentials:</strong> compressed online courses with a highly targeted curriculum to allow the learner to apply the knowledge directly to a workplace.</li><li>interesting phenomenon: a partnership between universities with online providers such as EdX to provide these microcredentials.</li><li>On the surface, the movement sounds like a great idea for students: unbundling university courses ==lowers the price==, and removing admission requirements also makes the courses ==more accessible.==</li><li>However, a ==conflict of interest== between students and corporation might arise by engaging with microcredential production:</li></ul><blockquote><p>As microcredentialing purveyors, colleges and universities also make themselves increasingly subservient to their new clients: businesses and corporations in need of rapid, targeted vocational training for their employees. The traditional mission of enabling student growth through transformative teaching is traded for a corporate mission of ==maximizing efficiency and profitability at all costs.==</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>the boom in microcredentials is being fed in large part by major companies—IBM, Google, and Amazon, to name a few—looking to ==grow their talent pipeline== and ==increase the skill level of current employees==</p></blockquote><ul><li>Microcredentials contribute to the ==decline of the traditional degree== by paving a way for people to substitute degree programs. For instance, Kazin and Clerkin ask, ‘why should an individual bother to pursue a full master’s degree if five courses alone are enough to confer career success?’.</li></ul><a href=#conclusion><h2 id=conclusion><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Conclusion</h2></a><ul><li>Dewey believed&mldr;<ul><li>that a broad and diverse liberal education will lead to more well-rounded individuals who will then be better able to contribute to a democratic society in order to ==solve social ills.==</li><li>that an education that is vocational (i.e. an education I can fully apply to the workplace) is an effective way to maintain the status quo and is ==ineffective for large scale changes==:</li></ul></li></ul><blockquote><p>The kind of vocational education in which I am interested is not one which will ‘adapt’ workers to the existing industrial regime; I am not sufficiently in love with the regime for that.

Unlike Liberal Arts education, which catalyzes changes in the entire character of the learner, vocationally oriented microcredentialing ==seeks only to transfer hard skills and technical competencies== to the client-learner. In the absence of a General Education component, microcredentialing tends to ==cultivate only a single dimension, aspect, or element of the learner’s character, effectively producing a technician, not a well-rounded person.== Past president of the University of Chicago, Robert Hutchins (1936/1958), voiced a similar complaint about vocational train- ing: ‘The pursuit of knowledge for its own sake is being rapidly obscured in universities and may soon be extinguished. [ . .] [S]oon everybody in a university will be there for the purpose of being trained for something. [ . .] It is plain, though, that it is bad for the universities to vocationalize them’ (36–7). Insofar as microcredentialing fails to educate the whole person, it exacerbates one symptom of the neoliberal learning economy, namely, the turn away from pursuing knowledge for its own sake and towards learning to earn (Siskin and Warner 2019).</p></blockquote><ul><li>By providing vocational training exclusively, higher education institutions cut their students off from more elevated pursuits (e.g. art, history, cultural studies) and ==condemn them to a life of subservience to their industrial and corporate masters.==</li></ul></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li>No backlinks found</li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://garden.bianca.digital/js/graph.abd4bc2af3869a96524d7d23b76152c7.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by Bianca Aguilar using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, © 2023</p><ul><li><a href=https://garden.bianca.digital/>Home</a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/biancamikaila>Twitter</a></li><li><a href=https://are.na/bianca-aguilar>Are.na</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
